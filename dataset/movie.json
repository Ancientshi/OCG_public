                "Plot Complexity": "Mike Carr and Johnny Dixon are roommates. After many months Mike returns to his old neighborhood and goes into Tim McGinnis\u2019 bar to wait for Estelle Mitchell, a woman he hasn't seen since soon after her twin sister Linda was murdered. He sits down and starts having flashbacks of the events around Linda's death. Johnny had been dating Estelle until he discovered that she was seeing other men. He dumped her and began a relationship with her sweet twin, Linda. Due to a head injury he had suffered during the war, Johnny experienced regular nervous breakdowns. He and Mike served in the army together and, being roommates, Mike nursed him through these. Johnny and Linda were very much in love, but Estelle wanted him back and was determined to break up the happy couple. In the meantime, she was seeing Mike, who had a hard time resisting her vampy style. But the twins both wanted Johnny, and one night they got into a fight over him, after which Linda went to see Johnny. Estelle tried to intercept and get to Johnny's first. Mike sees Estelle arrive before Linda and stops her from coming between the two lovers. However, when Mike returns to his apartment alone a couple of hours later, Estelle telephones Mike from her home and at her mother's request, to say that Linda never came home and has been reported missing. Mike finds Johnny, drunk and distraught. He begs Mike to verify his alibi - that Linda had left his and Mike's place after an argument with Johnny, and that he heard Linda whistle for, and then saw her get into, a taxi. When the police arrive at the scene they find a buckle from Linda's trench-coat on Johnny's apartment floor and, after finding Linda's body in the apartment building, they take Johnny in for questioning. Searching for clues in the men's room of McGinnis' bar, Mike finds another buckle outside its window. He goes to Johnny and suggests the possibility that Johnny's memory might have failed him the night of the murder. While they are talking, the police arrive to arrest Johnny and he panics. Mike helps his friend by letting him escape out the back. In order to persuade Mike to give Johnny up, Detective Heller takes Mike to the morgue to show him Linda's body. Heller then recounts the horrible details of Linda's death: After being choked, Linda was pushed, still alive, into the chute of the trash incinerator, and when he was unable to fit her in the tight space, the murderer shoved her in and broke her neck. The murderer then pulled her out and put her in a barrel on the roof. Mike is disgusted by this, but still doesn't believe his friend murdered Linda. After disarming Johnny (who bought had bought a revolver with money Mike had given him to get by on while in hiding) he convinces him to come forward and clear his name. As they arrive home, Estelle is waiting for them with an older, possessive man named Alex Tremholt, who has been renting a room at the Mitchells' since the twins were young. While they are there, Mike hears a woman whistle for a taxi, and realizes it must be the same one Johnny heard the night of the murder. Mike gives Tremholt the revolver and leaves to check on the whistler. When Tremholt insists on calling the police to arrest Johnny, he manages to escape once more. Detective Heller arrives and suspects Tremholt of having a long-standing, unrequited love for Estelle and of killing the innocent Linda, whom he mistook for Estelle, the object of his desire. With the truth being revealed, Mike hurries off to tell Johnny he is in the clear and cuts him down after nearly hanging himself. Back in the present, Estelle shows up at McGinnis' and Mike drags her to his old apartment and insinuates that she committed the murder. When he enters the flat, however, Heller is waiting to arrest him. The detective reveals that Jake, the apartment janitor, recently found Linda's necklace in the incinerator chute with Mike's fingerprints all over it. It turns out that Mike killed Linda, believing she was Estelle. After telling Mike that he only held Tremholt to fool Mike he was in the clear, Heller accompanies him down the stairs and past Estelle into the night.",

                    "Plot": "Following the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will refers to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit. A series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her in an honor killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage. While Nawal is at university in Daresh, civil war and war crimes break out, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Nawal leaves town to try to find her son and boards a bus full of Muslim refugees. Christian Nationalists shoot the driver and fire into the bus full of passengers, only missing Nawal and a mother with her child. As the Nationalists prepare to set the bus on fire, the survivors try to escape towards the back of the bus. Nawal shows her crucifix and tells the Nationalists that she is Christian. She attempts to save a child by claiming her as her own, but the child runs back towards the burning bus, calling for her mother, and is unceremoniously shot. Nawal finds her way back to town and joins the Muslim fighters. She tutors the son of a nationalist leader, eventually earning enough trust to smuggle in a gun to shoot the leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and sings through the screams of other prisoners, earning her the nickname 'The Woman Who Sings'. To attempt to break her, she is raped by torturer Abou Tarek who leaves her saying, 'Sing now.' She consequently gives birth to the twins. After traveling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May (the month he was born in) and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool and saw both the tattoo (proving him as her son) and his face (proving him as her rapist). The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke, which led to her decline and untimely death at age 60. The twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love. Horrified at the truth, Nihad tries to chase after the twins, but they are gone. Nawal gets her gravestone. Sometime later, Nihad visits it.",

Parts of the story were based on the life of Souha Bechara. The story is based on events that happened during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous. Director Denis Villeneuve first saw Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 2004, commenting 'I had this strong intuition that I was in front of a masterpiece'. Villeneuve acknowledged unfamiliarity with Arab culture, but was drawn to Incendies as 'a modern story with a sort of Greek tragedy element'. In adapting the screenplay, Villeneuve, while keeping the story structure and characters, replaced 'all' the dialogue, even envisioning a silent film, abandoning the idea due to expense. He showed Mouawad some completed scenes to convince the initially reluctant playwright to grant permission for the film. Villeneuve spent five years working on the screenplay, in between directing two films. Mouawad later praised the film as 'brilliantly elegant' and gave Villeneuve full credit. The project had a budget of $6.5 million, and received funding from Telefilm Canada."

In Quebec theatres alone, Incendies made $3 million. It was considered a success in the country. According to Box Office Mojo, the film completed its theatrical run on 29 September 2011, after making $2,071,334 in the U.S. According to The Numbers, the film grossed $6,857,096 in North America and $9,181,247 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,038,343.",
                        "CriticalResponse": "Incendies received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% positive reviews based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, 'It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 80 out 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'. The film enjoyed a positive reception in its country and province. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal gave it 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, 'Villeneuve has done his best work yet here'. The Montreal Gazette's Brendan Kelly gave the film five stars and called it a 'masterwork'. Marc Cassivi of La Presse claimed the film transcended the play. Peter Howell, writing for The Toronto Star, gave the film four stars, called it 'a commanding film of multiple revelations', and the best of 2010, and praised Lubna Azabal as 'first amongst equals'. However, Martin Morrow of CBC News was unimpressed, saying, 'Villeneuve's screen adaptation strips away all this finely textured flesh and leaves only the bare bones'. University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote that the film, along with Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012), represent a break in the Cinema of Quebec from focus on local history to global concerns, with Incendies adding Oedipal themes. Authors Gada Mahrouse, Chantal Maill\u00e9 and Daniel Sal\u00e9e wrote McCraw and D\u00e9ry's films, Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar and Inch'Allah, depict Quebec as part of the global village and as accepting minorities, particularly Middle Easterners or 'Muslim Others'. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying 'it wants to be much more than a thriller and succeeds in demonstrating how senseless and futile it is to hate others because of their religion', and Azabal 'is never less than compelling'. He later selected the film as his favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it lost to In a Better World from Denmark. Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars, referring to it as 'tough, spellbinding'. Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film three and a half stars, praising a bus scene as harrowing but saying the climax is 'a plot twist that feels like one coincidence too far', that 'leaves the audience doing math on their fingers rather than reeling in shock'. Incendies was named by Stephen Holden of The New York Times as one of the 10 best films of 2011. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it Villeneuve's 'best-realized work yet'. A number of reviews complimented use of the song 'You and Whose Army?' by Radiohead. Criticisms have included charges of melodrama and orientalism."

                    "Accolades": "On 22 September 2010, Incendies was chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. It made the shortlist on 19 January 2011, one of nine films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on 25 January 2011. It won eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actress for Azabal and Best Director for Villeneuve. Along with Incendies, Villeneuve won the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award in 2009 for the film Polytechnique, the first Canadian filmmaker to win it twice in a row. Incendies also won the Prix Jutra for Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actress (Azabal), Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Sound. It is also the only film to date to have won both the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film and the Vancouver International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film."

The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime. Jerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with an intellectual disability, is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry's suspicions. Still adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from Heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places it loved in life, before delivering it to God. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called 'The Giant' shortly before she was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of 'The Giant', but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him. Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same modus operandi as seen with Ginny's, which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful. While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (against whom Lori has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy and even begins a romance with Lori herself. One day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station. Jerry suspects that Jackson is Ginny's killer after he invites Chrissy to his church. Jerry rushes to the church after Jackson picks her up one day while he is fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close call, and that Jackson is not the killer. Meanwhile, Chrissy meets a man who drives a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of Ginny's drawing that stood out to Jerry. That night, while reading her a bedtime story, Chrissy tells Jerry that she met a 'wizard' who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell anyone about their interaction. (A later scene hints that the chocolates are laced with narcotics.) Chrissy tells Jerry she is supposed to meet the 'wizard' again the next day at a nearby picnic area. Using Chrissy as bait, Jerry stages a sting operation with Stan's help to catch the killer. However, while on the way to the meeting, the 'wizard' dies in a car accident; hours later, the SWAT team gives up and leaves Jerry alone. They inform Lori of what is happening. She confronts Jerry angrily about putting Chrissy in danger and breaks up with him. Sometime later, Jerry sits by himself on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute, and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.",

She wakes up in the hospital with amnesia, recalling nothing about the incident or her life prior. A man by her bedside (Mike Vogel) introduces himself as Russell Williams, her husband, and says that her name is Jennifer. To help her regain memories, he shows her photos of her life, telling her that her parents died in a fire two years ago, that she had quit her job, and that she rarely talks to her friends anymore. Detective Frank Page (Dennis Haysbert), obsessed with his work after failing to find his own daughter's kidnapper, investigates Jennifer's accident and grows suspicious of Russell, who drives a truck similar to one seen in the vicinity where Jennifer was hit. After Jennifer is discharged, Russell takes her to their secluded home. Jennifer is haunted by brief flashes of memories from the rainy night of her accident. She becomes uneasy by Russell's strange behavior and realizes that he has been locking her inside the house at night. She also notices that most of the photos in her home have been manipulated. Frank's investigation leads him to Jennifer's parents' home, where he finds their rotting corpses. He learns from Jennifer's former employer that 'Russell' is actually Ryan Gaerity, a temperamental worker fired over two months ago. While Ryan is out, Jennifer finds her own ID in his wallet, which she uses to unlock his computer. She finds images of her actual husband Russell (Daniel Booko) and realizes the danger she's in. Before she can escape, Ryan knocks her unconscious and chains her to the bed while he goes out to get supplies. When he returns, the real Russell's corpse is revealed to be in his car trunk. Frank arrives at their home and tries to rescue Jennifer, but Ryan knocks him out, locking him in a freezer. He rants to Jennifer that he had loved her for years but her lack of reciprocation and marriage to Russell enraged him, leading him to kill Russell and take Jennifer for himself. Jennifer manages to escape into the forest with Ryan giving chase. Knowing that Jennifer will never love him, Ryan decides to kill her with his gun, but Frank tackles him before he can shoot her, and Jennifer takes the gun and shoots Ryan in the arm. A wounded Ryan desperately attempts to run towards Jennifer to retrieve the gun, but Jennifer fires another shot, ultimately killing Ryan. Three months later, Frank gives Jennifer a note from her late husband that he had found during the investigation. As she drives, leaving for San Jose, Russell's voice narrates the note, telling her how much he loves her.",

                    "Plot": "Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, Money Monster. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but Camby unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland. Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000\u2014his entire life savings\u2014in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver\u2014and with it, Kyle's leverage\u2014is to shoot Lee and hope he survives. With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it. Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong. Once Camby arrives, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to Johannesburg, South Africa. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper misses a shot at Lee, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where, according to Diane, Camby is headed. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, simply clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers. Camby had bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. Had his plan succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when mine work resumed and the owner's stock owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company. Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then Kyle, much to Lee's dismay, gets fatally shot by the police. Lee punches Camby, as his greed and corruption cost Kyle his life. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be placed under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Lee and Patty reconcile, wondering how they follow their last broadcast.",

                    "Release": "In August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment set the film for an April 8, 2016 release. The film was later pushed back to May 13, 2016. The Money Monster Premiered in Cannes on May 12, 2016, where the cast attended the photocall and screening in the evening.",
                    "Reception": {
                        "BoxOffice": "Money Monster grossed $41 million in the United States and Canada, and $52.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $93.3 million, against a net production budget of $27 million. In North America, the film was released alongside The Darkness and the wide expansion of Green Room, and was projected to gross $10\u201312 million from 3,104 theaters in its opening weekend. The film grossed $600,000 from its early Thursday night previews and $5 million on its first day. It went on to gross $14.8 million in its opening weekend, beating expectations and finishing 3rd at the box office behind Captain America: Civil War and The Jungle Book. It fell 53% to $7 million in its second weekend, finishing 6th.",
                        "CriticalResponse": "On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site's critics consensus reads: 'Money Monster's strong cast and solidly written story ride a timely wave of socioeconomic anger that's powerful enough to overcome an occasionally muddled approach to its worthy themes.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating 'mixed or average reviews'. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of 'B+' on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 81% overall positive score, with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it. Clooney's performance was praised by critics. A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that the 'quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points.' Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com, in a mixed review, praised Clooney's 'enormous charisma', but criticized the film for not 'being quite as thrilling or thought-provoking as [its] premise sounds.' Chris Hewitt of Empire however gave a more positive review. Several reviewers praised the atmosphere of suspense. Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the film, particularly Foster's directing and her ability to 'keep things moving'. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that Foster 'keeps the action vigorous and the suspense high', but said that the film was 'swallowed up by the very hectoring and impersonal sensationalism that it derides.' Some reviewers criticized the script. Wendy Ide of The Observer gave the film a negative review, writing that the film lacks the 'authentic anger' of The Big Short and the 'sniper-like accuracy' of Network, criticizing Clooney's 'complete lack of sincerity'. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that what the script lacks in 'emotional subtext' can be found in the cast's 'richly detailed' performances. In a mixed review, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called the film a 'raucous hostage thriller that eschews explanation for wish-fulfillment', concluding by saying that 'in the heat of the moment, Money Monster's bluster and nerve keeps you hooked.' Josh Lasser of IGN was critical of the film's mix of comedy and drama, calling the transitions 'too fast, ripping the audience out of the unfolding drama.' Despite comparisons of Clooney's character to Jim Cramer and his TV show Mad Money, Clooney and Foster denied this."

                    "Plot": "In Monte Carlo, Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier) stops to speak to Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) only after recognizing her companion (Joan Fontaine), the woman he had encountered earlier. Maxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge, seemingly contemplating suicide. A young woman shouts at him to stop him in his tracks, but he curtly asks her to walk on. Later, at a Monte Carlo hotel, the same young woman, serving as a paid companion to the pompous aging Mrs. Van Hopper, again encounters the debonair widower de Winter. Aspiring to social prominence, Mrs. Van Hopper is obsequious to the aristocratic de Winter, but is soon confined to her room due to illness. Maxim invites the companion on excursions, which she conceals from her employer as tennis lessons, and the young woman soon becomes infatuated, though puzzled by such attention. On her recovery, Mrs. Van Hopper decides to leave Monte Carlo; her companion furtively informs Maxim of her departure, and Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. After being informed of the proposal by Maxim, a shocked Mrs. Van Hopper privately tells her companion that Maxim is marrying her as a desperate distraction because he is still tormented by thoughts of his beloved dead wife, Rebecca. She asserts that her companion is ill-prepared to be the second Mrs. de Winter and cannot hope to succeed as the mistress of the stately Manderley. Maxim brings his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in Cornwall. Manderley is dominated by its austere housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a cold and unyielding woman who had once been a confidante of the first Mrs. de Winter. Danvers harbors a deep resentment for the new Mrs. de Winter, whom she views as a usurper. Danvers feeds the bride's insecurity by showing her Rebecca's grand bedroom suite, left untouched and off-limits to the new wife, and by retaining items throughout the house that carry Rebecca's monogram. Eventually, constant reminders of Rebecca's glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his tragically drowned first wife, which could explain his restlessness and irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to assert her new role by holding a costume party as Maxim and Rebecca had done annually. Danvers suggests she copy the dress that one of Maxim's ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. However, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. When Mrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window of Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog and, during the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat with Rebecca's body in it has been discovered. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When Rebecca implied she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim's line. During a heated argument, Rebecca fell, struck her head, and died. Afraid he would be blamed for her death, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled; some days later, he identified another body that washed ashore as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her na\u00efve ways. When the inquest considers the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, threatening to reveal a letter from Rebecca hinting at a pregnancy that made suicide improbable. When Maxim informs the police of the attempted blackmail, they must investigate Favell's accusations that Maxim murdered Rebecca. Further investigation with a doctor, however, reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her to ruin him. As a free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.",

Vincent accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself. Months later, Malcolm has begun working with Cole Sear, a nine-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his own failure to help Vincent and to reconcile with Anna, who is suffering from depression. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in it, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Once released, he faints and appears to have been physically assaulted, which his mother attributes to the bullies. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who are unaware that they are dead. Malcolm believes Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent was supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them. One night, Cole finds Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He works out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he gives to her father. The tape reveals that her stepmother poisoned her food, alerting her father to the cause of her death and saving her younger sister. Cole is given a lead part in his school play. He is coached by a ghost director and gives his performance with Malcolm looking on. Before leaving, Cole suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep so he can hear her thoughts and feelings. Cole tells Lynn his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her that his late grandmother visits him and describes details from his mother's childhood that he could not have known. Shocked, Lynn finally believes him. Malcolm returns home to find his wedding video playing and Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her. Suddenly, she drops his wedding ring, and he notices that he is not wearing it. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see, Malcolm locates his gunshot injury, and he realizes that he did not survive being shot by Vincent. He has been dead the entire time while working with Cole. Malcolm quickly comes to terms with the fact that he is a ghost and apologizes to Anna for haunting her and not letting her move on. He tells her that she was never second to anything and that he loves her. Anna indicates she is now at peace, and Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.",

                    "Review": "I really recently just watched Donnie Darko and I was super blown away by it. I loved the movie's originality, atmosphere, and complexity. All of the characters were interesting and I cared about them. Particularly the acting from Jake Gyllenhaal was truly amazing.",
                    "Themes Analysis": "The reason why I\u2019m making this post is to examine the message and themes of Donnie Darko. Because the plot in itself is so complicated, I feel people are too focused on unraveling that to really talk about the actual themes and message of the film. Usually, looking up the analysis of a film would reveal its message and meaning. But doing that with this film only led me to websites talking about the time travel aspect of the movie. This is my first watch of my film, so I think I still need to pick up on a lot. What I saw was a theme of isolation and selflessness.",
                    "Character Insights": "Donnie starts out as an isolated, resentful kid who\u2019s cold towards his family. He also discusses with his therapist about dying alone, saying he fears it but also feels it\u2019s unavoidable. I found this interesting as Donnie is quite clearly the cause of his own isolation as a result of his antisocial, cold behavior. He hates being so alone, but is also the cause behind such loneliness.",
                    "Selflessness Theme": "I think selflessness/sacrifice is another theme present in the film. Depending on which theory you follow about the time travel stuff, it can be interpreted that Donnie willingly allows himself to be killed by the jet engine that falls through his bedroom.",
                    "Foreshadowing": "I also noticed that when Donnie and Gretchen are exiting the theater, the camera clearly focuses on the movie titles. While most are Halloween based, there\u2019s also the movie title of 'The Passion of Christ' - which isn\u2019t a Halloween-y movie at all. I feel this was sort of foreshadowing of Donnie, a chosen person given special gifts who ultimately has to sacrifice himself.",
                    "Mother's Role": "His mother also embodies this theme. Rather than be resentful of her son for his issues or his various outbursts, she completely loves him and accepts him.",
                    "Final Thoughts": "Ultimately, these themes of isolation and sacrifice connect to form the theme of 'destruction leads to creation'. In the ending of the film, Donnie is afraid to die alone, but seconds before being hit by a jet engine - he starts laughing."

                    "Plot": "Sean and Anna are a married couple living in New York City. At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies. Ten years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fianc\u00e9, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on. Sometime later, at a party for Anna's mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband. That night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms. Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning. Anna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt. When Anna misses an appointment with her fianc\u00e9 to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips. Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused. When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean's edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.",

                    "Production": "Director Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about 'the idea of eternal love' and a 'mystery of the heart'. While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a 'paranormal piece'. He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on. The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: 'There's this little kid and he tells a woman he's her dead husband \u2013 and he's ten years old.' Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re at his producer's recommendation. Carri\u00e8re ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant. The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story. With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead. 'We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,' said Glazer. 'I'm not a Buddhist and I don't believe in reincarnation; I don't think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.'"

After telling a doctor named Dr. Mahmoud that he needs immediate help, Craig is admitted for five days at the hospital's adult psychiatric floor, due to the temporary closure of the psychiatric floor for adolescents.

He was also facing feelings of inferiority in the shadow of his best friend Aaron, and pressure from his father to succeed academically. Throughout his stay, Craig bonds with various patients in the psychiatric unit, including Bobby, who takes Craig under his wing. Craig learns about Bobby's struggles and helps him, while Bobby helps Craig gain the courage to ask out Noelle, another patient.

Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in Los Angeles and suggests that he come to stay with her in their childhood hometown of Nyack, New York. He agrees and meets Maggie's husband Lance. Milo is surprised when Lance tells him that he and Maggie are trying to have a baby, as Maggie never expressed a desire for children. Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking contraceptive pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she had been having sex with her scuba instructor Billy. She worries that she is not worthy of Lance, but Milo reassures her. Milo reconnects with his high school English teacher Rich, with whom he had a sexual relationship when he was 15. Rich now has a sixteen-year-old son and is dating a woman. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later, Milo appears at Rich's house while his son is there. This infuriates Rich, who does not want his past exposed. Maggie is also upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich, as she exposed the relationship to end it as well as Rich's teaching career. Milo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, a boy who their father had assured him would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turns out that the bully has a successful happy life, and it is Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he will not kill himself, and he promises to try not to. Lance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, leading Lance to find the contraceptives. Maggie ends the relationship with Billy and returns home where she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no 'marriage', and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide he should do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note and goes to the pool where she had been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to her body, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps into the pool and rescues her. The film closes with the twins at Maggie's house, looking at their new fish tank filled with goldfish.",

After his father's premature death, Gilbert has assumed the responsibility of caring for Arnie, his developmentally delayed younger brother. In addition to being Arnie's caregiver, Gilbert is expected to hold a steady job in order to provide for the family financially. Amy, Gilbert's older sister, assumes the maternal role. She cooks and cleans the family's home, and she even assists in its many repairs. However, it becomes clear that each family member is burdened by their responsibilities. They are still young, and it is evident that their emotional development has been stunted because they have been expected to behave like adults. Once Becky comes to town, the Grape family is pushed to re-evaluate their functionality, their domestic duties, and their own mental health statuses in order to preserve their longevity.",

                "Plot Summary": "In an alternate 2008, <b>Tasya Vos</b> is an assassin who takes control of other people's bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos' consciousness is inserted into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of the job, although the movie's intro sequence has her deviate from her protocol and struggling to commit suicide by her own gun, getting the host shot by shooting at arriving police forces instead. Vos struggles with neurological symptoms and increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, <b>Michael</b>, and son, <b>Ira</b>. She 'practices' assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael. Vos' handler, retired assassin <b>Girder</b>, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it. Despite her fragile mental state and fatigue, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO <b>John Parse</b> and his daughter, <b>Ava</b>, by possessing Ava's fianc\u00e9, <b>Colin Tate</b>. While assuming the host's life, the neurological symptoms worsen, but Vos hides this during her handler's check-ins. The hit is only a partial success as Ava dies, but not Parse. Vos attempts to finish the job per protocol by forcing Tate to shoot himself, but again cannot make him pull the trigger. During a dissociative break, in which Vos struggles to remain in control of Tate's body, he stabs himself in the skull, damaging the implant and causing severe neurological symptoms on Vos' own body, causing her internal physical damage. Vos discovers she can neither leave Tate's body, nor overpower his consciousness. Tate regains control, but is severely disoriented, in shock and traumatized from the violence before him, so he flees the crime scene. He seeks refuge with his friend <b>Reeta</b>, while experiencing fragmented memories of Vos' life. He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava. <b>Eddie</b>, a co-employee from Tate's workplace who reveals himself to be a plant from Vos' agency, arrives at the apartment to help Vos regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails and Tate kills Eddie during another dissociative episode in which Tate becomes aware of Vos' presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child, and home. Tate goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. Vos appears inside Tate\u2019s mind and goads Tate into killing Michael. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver, in a similar manner as the movie's opening sequence's job. Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, killing him, also reminiscent to the opening sequence's stabbing. Vos uses Tate's last moments to shoot Ira dead, who is then revealed to also have been a host. Vos returns to her own body and discovers that it was Girder who had taken control of Ira. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, as Girder wanted. In another debriefing, Vos sorts through her personal objects again. She contemplates and recognizes the butterfly, but does not express any guilt for killing it. Girder smiles and replies, 'Very good.'",

The remaining population, the Factionless, holds no status or privilege. Upon turning sixteen, children undergo a serum-induced psychological aptitude test that reveals their best-suited faction, although they can choose any faction as their permanent group during the subsequent Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice Prior lives in Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew, and Abnegation's leader, Marcus Eaton, serve on the ruling council. When Beatrice was tested, her results show equal attributes of multiple factions: Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless, making her a Divergent. Her proctor Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation. She warns her to conceal her accurate results because Divergents can think independently and would threaten the existing social order. The next day, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite at the Choosing Ceremony, while she selects Dauntless. She meets Christina, Al, and Will, other faction transfers. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. A harsh Dauntless leader, Eric Colter, warns the initiates that those who fail to meet the faction's high standards will become Factionless. Beatrice jumps from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net and gaining respect from Four, a transferred instructor. Beatrice initially struggles in Dauntless training and ranks far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help, she slowly improves. Eric then matches her against her nemesis, Candor transfer Peter Hayes, in a fight that ends with Beatrice's defeat and recovery in the infirmary. Unwilling to miss the crucial Capture the Flag test, she leaves the infirmary, joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut. In the next training phase, the initiates confront their deepest fears in psychological simulations. Beatrice's divergence enables her to creatively navigate the tests, but Four cautions her to conceal her abilities and approach the challenges like a typical Dauntless would. Beatrice visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her, but Four rescues her. Al begs Tris to forgive him the next day, but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into 'The Pit'. Four takes Beatrice into his fear simulations to prepare her for the final test. There, she learns that he is Tobias Eaton and that his father, Marcus, used to beat him as a child. Beatrice then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The Dauntless recruits are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for mind control. The next day, the Dauntless prepares to attack Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who is also Divergent. When the Dauntless raids Abnegation, they split from their group to find Beatrice's parents. However, Eric captures Four, realizing he isn\u2019t under control, and orders Beatrice's execution. Her mother, Natalie, a former Dauntless, saves her but is later shot and killed during their escape. Tris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, so Beatrice goes in alone to find Four, who is now under mind control designed for Divergents. Knowing Four's fears, Beatrice manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader, Jeanine Matthews, has Dauntless execute nearly the entire Abnegation faction. Beatrice uses a sample of the mind control serum on herself to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.",

There he is placed under the supervision of lab worker Lester to help load supplies onto an experimental rocket ship. While on board with Lester, Orville flips the ignition switch and the rocket ship blasts off, flying across the country and eventually landing outside of New Orleans, where Mardi Gras is in progress. Lester and Orville, believing that they have successfully landed on Mars, don spacesuits and go into the city, where they assume the grotesquely costumed celebrants are Martians, while the others assume they are fellow costumed celebrants. Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse and Mugsy, stumble upon the rocket ship, put on spacesuits and head to New Orleans to rob a bank and steal clothes. Lester and Orville are wrongly accused of the crimes and flee back to the rocket ship, where Mugsy and Harry force them to launch and demand to actually go to Mars. However, once in outer space, Lester and Orville get control of the crooks' gun and attempt to land back on Earth. The ship instead lands on Venus, where the four men are quickly captured by female guards and brought to the ruler of the planet, Queen Allura. She informs them that Venus is inhabited only by women because men were banished long ago. She takes more than a liking to Orville and makes him her king consort on the condition that he remains true to her. Orville agrees, and has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned. However, Mugsy convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove to Queen Allura that he cannot be trusted. Disillusioned with Orville, the Queen orders all the men to leave Venus. Upon returning to the Earth, the men are lauded as heroes in a parade, but Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a spaceship to Earth to drop a cake on Orville's head.",

                    "Plot": "Carrying out orders, inexperienced hitman Ray shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a young boy standing behind him. He and his mentor Ken are sent to hide in Bruges by their boss Harry, where they are to sightsee and await further instruction. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chlo\u00eb, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple over smoking indoors and punches them. Chlo\u00eb takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the small-time criminal and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chlo\u00eb admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chlo\u00eb drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chlo\u00eb's stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites. Harry calls Ken and reveals that the trip was an attempt to give Ray a good experience before he dies. He orders Ken to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken phones Harry to tell him the truth, and Harry immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun and a box of dumdum bullets at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention. Ray's train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chlo\u00eb bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Meanwhile, Harry spots Ken at a caf\u00e9. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Meanwhile, Eirik crosses the market square and sees Ray and Chlo\u00eb on a date. He rushes up the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the stairs. Ken tries to disarm Harry, but he is mortally shot in the neck as Harry rushes to the square. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower, and accepts he must jump to save Ray. The warning works, and Ken warns Ray with his dying breath, but his gun is broken during the fall, forcing Ray back to the hotel to retrieve his own. Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray jumps onto a passing barge, but loses Eirik's gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray stumbles into the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray with the dumdum bullets. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried through the movie set and watches the other characters pass by (Chlo\u00eb, Marie and Eirik) as he is loaded into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die. His fate is left ambiguous.",

I glossed over it in the past because it was known as his weakest movie, and only decided to watch it days ago. WHAT. THE. HELL. I wrote that for two reasons. One: this is a fantastic movie with great performances, an eerie score and hauntingly beautiful imagery. Two: It has to be the most confusing film I have ever seen, and that is a hard bar to surpass considering what my brain has witnessed. Enemy is almost like if Only God Forgives focused less on violence and more on interesting characters while providing all the necessary visual storytelling. It combines both scarring visuals with a narrative that\u2019s too rarely seen in cinema. Despite not being his greatest movie, it certainly is not his worst, and I\u2019d even go as far as to call it a masterpiece. Then again, basically all of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s films are. This film is too much for just a simple review, and calls for an in-depth analysis."

                    "Summary": "Taxi Driver is a 1976 American neo-noir psychological drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader. Set in a morally decaying New York City following the Vietnam War, it stars Robert De Niro as veteran Marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle, whose mental state deteriorates as he works nights in the city. The film also stars Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks in his first film role.",
                    "Production": "With The Wrong Man (1956) and A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences. Filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed for the film what would be his final score; the music was finished just hours before his death, and the film is dedicated to him.",
                    "Release": "Theatrically released by Columbia Pictures on February 8, 1976, the film was critically and commercially successful despite generating controversy both for its graphic violence in the climactic ending and for the casting of then 12-year-old Foster as a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for De Niro), and Best Supporting Actress (for Foster).",
                    "Controversies": "Although Taxi Driver generated further controversy for inspiring John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the film has remained popular. It is considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time, garnering cult status. In 2022, Sight & Sound named it the 29th-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, and the 12th-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll, tied with Barry Lyndon. In 1994, the film was considered 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically' significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.",
                    "Plot": "In New York City, Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequenting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms such as 'you're only as healthy as you feel.' He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses in the city and dreams about getting 'the scum off the streets.'",

It was something timely and relevant even at the time it was made thanks to tabloid journalism, and it eerily feels more so now thanks to social media and how anyone can be a celebrity and have a following no matter what a terrible person they are."

Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by A24, receiving critical acclaim with praise towards its editing, cinematography, score, Jenkins's direction and screenplay, and handling of the themes of sexuality and masculinity. Moonlight has been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture\u2014along with Best Supporting Actor (Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay\u2014from a total of eight nominations, at the 89th Academy Awards."

I made a post a few days ago about how T3 had ruined the franchise on account of it being the first major dip in quality in the series and permanently fracturing the Terminator legacy, but that was before I sat through the two hour long insult to my intelligence that was Terminator Genisys. I put off watching this movie for years because I knew it was bad, but holy shit I had no idea it was THIS bad. The moment Sarah Conner swiftly killed off the original T-800 with a single shot I knew I was in for some absolute bullshit. T3 and Salvation are objectively not good films, but by comparison are masterpiece works of art next to this abject failure of a motion picture. Without having seen Dark Fate I can comfortably say Genisys is the worst Terminator movie, because there is absolutely no way DF can be worse. It\u2019s simply impossible. This is not a Terminator film, but an absolute mockery of the original and a disgrace to the series overall. 1/10. Do better."

                "Plot Complexity": "Naked is a 1993 British black comedy drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh and starring David Thewlis as Johnny, a loquacious intellectual, philosopher and conspiracy theorist. The film won several awards, including Best Director and Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Naked marked a new career high for Leigh as a director and made the then-unknown Thewlis an internationally recognised star. In a Manchester alley, Johnny is having sex with a woman, who initially encourages him but then protests that he is hurting her, pushes him away, and runs off vowing that \"her Bernard\" will get vengeance on him for this. Johnny grabs his things from his apartment, steals a car, and flees to Dalston, a \"scrawny, unpretentious area\" in east London. He seeks refuge at the home of Louise, a former girlfriend from Manchester, who is not happy to see him. Louise works as a file clerk and lives with two flatmates, the unemployed Sophie, whom she calls her \"hippy-dippy friend\", and the primary tenant Sandra, a nurse who is away in Zimbabwe. Johnny seduces Sophie while treating Louise coldly, but soon tires of her. He leaves and walks around central London, expounding his world view at length to anyone who will listen. Among the people he meets are Archie, a young Scottish man looking for his girlfriend Maggie on Brewer Street, and Brian, a security guard who looks after an empty office building at night, which Johnny calls \"the most tedious job in England\", while planning to move to a seaside cottage in the future. After pursuing a drunk woman and rejecting her when he notices a skull and crossbones tattoo on her shoulder, Johnny follows a young cafe worker home but is thrown out when she starts crying. He hitches a ride with a man hanging posters around town until the man, exasperated by Johnny's nonstop haranguing, throws him down in the street and kicks him before driving off with Johnny's duffel bag containing his clothes and books. Johnny wanders the streets and is severely beaten by a wandering gang of thugs. He returns to Louise's residence to find that their landlord Jeremy (aka Sebastian), a psychopathic and amoral yuppie and rapist, has let himself into the apartment. Jeremy raped Sophie and dropped several hundred pounds for her 'services'. Sophie is desperate to get Jeremy out of the house, but she and Louise fear the police will not help. They try to keep the injured Johnny quiet, but he has a fit that awakens the sleeping Jeremy. Sandra returns early from her trip. Though horrified by the state of the apartment, she tends to Johnny's injuries. Louise drives Jeremy from the house by feigning interest in him but then pulling a knife on him.

In fact, while we\u2019re on the subject, another thing that really gets on my cinematic tits are movies featuring impassive-faced heroes pulling off ludicrous gymnastics that choked up the blockbuster scene in the wake of The Matrix. So you can imagine how stoked I must have been when trying to stir up enthusiasm to make it through \u00c6on Flux, a relentlessly awful adaptation of the MTV animated series of the same name that spends the entirety of its runtime doing everything in its power to make you hate it with the fire of a thousand suns.",

By 2415, humans, numbering a mere five million, have gathered to live within the walled city-state known as Bregna which is run by a Congress of scientists. Although the place is kind of nice for a dystopian city located on an inhospitable earth, there are numerous reports of mysterious disappearances and the population is plagued by nightmares. Because this is a future dystopian movie, we meet \u00c6on Flux, a cat-suited warrior for the rebel organisation known as the Monicans, whose successful mission to take out a surveillance station is marred by the fact that her beloved sister was mistakenly murdered while under suspicion of being an agent for the resistance. Consumed with vengeance, \u00c6on takes a mission to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild, but like every movie similar to this that's ever been made, not only is there a mystery villain out there pulling everybody\u2019s strings, but \u00c6on has a hidden past that\u2019s linked directly into the growing mental issues the people of Bregna are suffering from.",

I get that the movie's themes and how it delivers them is quite...shocking, but it still felt quite accessible to me. The surrealism, the action, the cinematography was all top notch, and was visually compelling enough that I thought it would also attract more 'mainstream' audiences. I get that it's a movie that demands a fair amount of engagement to land its themes, but still, it was so engaging that that level of attention felt effortless to me.",

Even the movie itself goes through a sort of genre-bending transformation, with its head deep in psychological horror, and its second half deeper in contemplation and drama. Overall, this movie felt exceptionally unique, fresh, and special - both for its bold ambitions and its masterful execution.",

                    "Plot": "Jen and Richard take a chartered helicopter to his secluded luxury vacation home in the desert. The pilot gives Richard a small bag of peyote. Jen is a young, beautiful American who wants to move to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams and believes Richard can help her. She seduces him, and afterwards, he calls his wife to check in. The next morning, Richard's friends Stan and Dimitri arrive early to take part in a hunting trip. Richard is forced to introduce Jen to them as he planned for her to leave before they arrived. That night, the four of them party. Jen asks to take the peyote but Richard declines, citing an anecdote he heard about a man who took peyote and sawed off his own leg without feeling it. Inebriated, Jen dances a sexy routine. When an exhausted Richard declines to join her, she dances seductively with Stan instead. Jen awakes to Richard being away for the morning. Stan becomes aggressive when she rebuffs his advances, and eventually rapes her. Dimitri sees the rape but ignores it. Richard returns and berates Stan, but when Jen asks to go home, he insists that she move to Canada on his dime. When Jen threatens to reveal their relationship to Richard's wife, Richard slaps her, and she runs off into the desert, pursued by the three men. Richard then shoves her off a cliff and she is impaled by a tree branch. Believing Jen to be dead, Richard assures his friends that they can finish their trip before anyone finds the body. Jen regains consciousness, and while bleeding, is able to painfully free herself, but with a piece of the tree branch still stuck through her torso. When the men return, she hides. With night approaching, they split up to cover more ground. Jen catches Dimitri alone, but he grabs her face and holds her underwater. She grabs his hunting knife and stabs him in the eye. With Dimitri dead, Jen takes his shotgun and hides in a cave. She remembers she has Richard's peyote and takes it, before entering a heightened state of mind when she removes the branch and heats a beer can in the fire to cauterize the wound. The artwork on the can leaves a perfect brand/scar of a phoenix on her belly. After a series of nightmares of the men hunting her, Jen leaves the cave to deal with them. Richard and Stan find Dimitri's body in the water. Stan takes the SUV to continue the hunt, but while filling the gas tank, Jen ambushes him. A bloody gunfight follows, and Stan is shot and killed by Jen while trying to run her over. After not being able to contact Stan on the radio, Richard speeds back home and calls a helicopter to pick him up. While showering, he hears a noise. Jen surprises him and manages to shoot him in the stomach. The two chase each other around the house with shotguns as Richard's blood covers every floor and wall. Despite his blood loss, Richard is able to catch Jen and begins strangling her, but Jen forces her hand into his exposed stomach, allowing her to retake the gun and ultimately shoot Richard dead. A bloodied but triumphant Jen walks out of the house as she hears the helicopter approach.",

Though Fargeat was aware of the rape and revenge film genre, she did not set out to make a film of that type and had never seen I Spit on Your Grave, one of the most well-known films of the genre. Said Fargeat: 'I wanted to take this story out of the genre of horror. I didn't want Jen to be screaming and suffering for the whole movie, trying to survive. I wanted her to go somewhere else and transform into a cool and badass character.'",

Said Fargeat: 'We had to find the villa, the desert, and the water in the same country. I loved the idea of not being able to recognize exactly where the desert is.' Principal photography on the film began on 6 February and wrapped on 21 March 2017."

Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating 'universal acclaim'."

                    "Plot": "Ove Lindahl, a 59-year-old widower, lives in a townhouse neighborhood where he once chaired the association until his friend Rune replaced him. Rune, now paralyzed from a stroke, is cared for by his wife, Anita. Since his wife Sonja, a schoolteacher, died from cancer six months ago, Ove has been depressed. Forced into retirement from the railroad company where he worked for 43 years, Ove's routine involves enforcing neighborhood rules and visiting Sonja's grave to talk to her. After sorting out his affairs, Ove tries to hang himself, triggering a flashback to his childhood. His mother's death left him with his silent father, a mechanic at the train company. His father's excitement about Ove's academic success leads to a fatal accident when he's hit by a train while spreading the news. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Iranian immigrant Parvaneh, her Swedish husband Patrick, and their children moving in across the street. Her persistence breaks through Ove's tough exterior, causing him to abandon the noose for carbon monoxide poisoning. As Ove drifts into unconsciousness, memories flood back of 'the Whiteshirts' trying to demolish his childhood home, which he defiantly repairs. A fire started by a neighbor leads to Ove also losing his home, forcing him to sleep on a train where he meets Sonja. Smitten, he starts dating her, and she inspires him to pursue an engineering degree. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted again by Parvaneh needing a ride to the hospital for her husband's accident. After reluctantly helping, Ove ends up supervising Parvaneh and Patrick's daughters in the lobby, causing a scene and being asked to leave. Later, at the train station, he plans to end his life but instead saves a man who faints onto the tracks. His heroic act catches the attention of Lena, a local reporter, whom he evades with Parvaneh's help. Parvaneh persuades Ove to teach her how to drive, leading to conversations about his past friendship with Rune and their falling out over car preferences. At Parvaneh's insistence, Ove reluctantly takes in a stray cat, and starts to bond with it. He also repairs a confiscated bike for a local teen named Adrian, who works at a kebab shop with Mirsad. Ove notices Mirsad's eye makeup but doesn't judge him. Despite improving relations with his neighbors, Ove clashes with two Whiteshirts. He then tries to end his life with a shotgun but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad seeking refuge after Mirsad's family disowns him for coming out as gay. Reluctantly, Ove offers him shelter. Ove learns that the Whiteshirts plan to move Rune to a nursing home, information Anita kept from him and Sonja. Ove realizes his grudge against Rune was foolish and declares war on the Whiteshirts. However, his confrontations yield little results. Frustrated, Ove shares with Parvaneh about a tragic vacation in Spain with a pregnant Sonja that ended in a bus crash. Despite Ove's efforts, Sonja lost the baby and was left paraplegic, leading Ove to build a wheelchair ramp at her school when authorities failed to do so. In the present day, journalist Lena confronts the Whiteshirts with evidence of their financial misconduct, leading to their retreat in the face of public scrutiny. Backed by supportive neighbors, Anita prevents Rune's forced relocation, allowing Ove to reconcile with him. Later, Ove collapses and is hospitalized with an enlarged heart. Parvaneh gives birth to a son while teasing Ove about his failed attempts at dying. Ove gifts his unborn child's crib to Parvaneh and forms a close bond with her daughters, who affectionately call him grandpa. Months pass, and during a winter storm, Ove is found peacefully dead in his bed, with his cat by his side. His modest funeral is attended by numerous neighbors, symbolizing the impact he had on their lives. Finally at peace, Ove awakens on a train to find Sonja sitting across from him once more.",

Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it. Agnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party. Elin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes. After becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in \u00c5m\u00e5l. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving \u00c5m\u00e5l and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car. Elin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school. The film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying 'It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.'",

There are three things that impressed me the most about this movie: 1. The cute face and hairstyle of little girl Yingzi, and her eyes are full of innocence. 2. The theme music that always appears at the right time, revealing a touch of parting emotion. 3. The slow-paced way of life in old Beijing. For example, camels and donkeys are used as means of transportation, to dig well water, etc. Everything is the real memory of little girl Yingzi, through her innocent eyes observation, it is really full of emotion, as if it is an unreal past. But I know that those people and things did exist. The good thing is that the little girl doesn't distinguish between good and bad, so she can get close to many people. Now we are all good at value judgment and moral judgment, and it is difficult to be a quiet observer like her. 'Let the past thing pass'. This is one of lines. With the lyrics of the theme music, life seems to be constantly saying goodbye to people and things in the past. Both unpleasant and beautiful things will gradually leave us. What a sadness feeling at last.",

Talbot tries to warn Wilbur of a shipment due to arrive for 'McDougal's House of Horrors'. However, before he finishes, the moon rises and Talbot transforms into a werewolf, causing Wilbur to think the call is a prank. Meanwhile, McDougal demands the crates be personally delivered to his wax museum. Chick and Wilbur deliver the crates after hours. They open the first one and find Dracula's coffin. When Chick leaves the room to retrieve the second crate, Wilbur reads the Dracula legend and the coffin suddenly opens, and Dracula sneaks out. Wilbur is so frightened he can barely articulate his call for help. When Chick returns, he refuses to believe the story. The boys open the second crate, and Chick goes to greet McDougal. Dracula hypnotizes Wilbur, finds Frankenstein's Monster in the second crate, and reanimates him. Both leave and McDougal finds the crates empty and has Wilbur and Chick arrested. That night, Dr Sandra Mornay welcomes Dracula and the Monster to her island castle. Sandra has seduced Wilbur as part of Dracula's plan to give the monster a more obedient brain. Meanwhile, Wilbur and Chick are bailed out of jail by Joan Raymond, an undercover insurance investigator who feigns love for Wilbur, hoping to gain information. Wilbur invites Joan to a masquerade ball that evening. Talbot takes the apartment across the hall from Wilbur and Chick and asks them to help him find and destroy Dracula and the Monster. Wilbur agrees, but Chick remains sceptical. Wilbur, Chick and Joan go to Sandra's castle to pick her up for the ball. Wilbur answers a telephone call from Talbot, who informs them that they are in fact in the 'House of Dracula'. Wilbur reluctantly agrees to search the castle and soon stumbles upon a basement staircase, where he has a few close encounters with the monsters. Meanwhile, Joan discovers Dr Frankenstein's notebook in Sandra's desk, and Sandra finds an Insurance Investigator ID in Joan's purse. Dracula, under the alias of Dr Lejos, introduces himself to Joan and the boys. Also working at the castle and attending the ball is the na\u00efve Professor Stevens, who questions some of the specialized equipment that has arrived. After Wilbur says that he was in the basement, Sandra feigns a headache and tells the others to attend the ball without her. In private, Sandra admits to Dracula that she feels they are not safe to conduct the experiment. Dracula then turns her into a vampire. At the masquerade ball, Talbot accuses Lejos of being Dracula, but no one takes him seriously. Joan soon disappears. Sandra lures Wilbur into the woods and attempts to bite him, but fails. While looking for Joan, Talbot becomes the Wolfman and attacks McDougal. Since Chick's costume is a wolf, McDougal accuses Chick, who escapes and witnesses Dracula hypnotizing Wilbur. Chick is also hypnotized and rendered helpless, while Dracula and Sandra bring Wilbur, Stevens, and Joan back to the castle. The next morning, Chick and Talbot meet up in the bayou and set out to rescue Wilbur and Joan. Wilbur is quickly freed, but Dracula uses hypnotism to call him back. As Sandra prepares to cut into Wilbur's brain, Talbot and Chick burst in. Chick knocks out Sandra with a chair and Talbot tries to release Wilbur but turns into the Wolfman again. Frankenstein's Monster breaks free of his bonds and Sandra tries to control him, but he throws her out the window. After a chase through the house between Chick, Wilbur and the Monster and a face-off between Dracula and The Wolf Man, Dracula transforms into a bat but is pounced on by the Wolfman, who drags the two of them to their deaths. Chick and Wilbur escape in boats; while Joan and Stevens set the pier ablaze while the Monster is standing on it, and he dies in the flames. Wilbur scolds Chick for his earlier scepticism, and Chick remarks they have nothing to fear now. The Invisible Man addresses them from the boat's thwart, and they flee in terror."

Keeping everything hanging together is Ralph Fiennes, playing the head chef of the establishment where the noxious guests meet their end. He\u2019s incredible, combining pathos with a biting, sarcastic disposition and a vicious temper that leads to some of the film\u2019s cruelest and funniest jokes."

                    "plot": "The Tomorrow War is a story about a war between humans and an alien race called the Whitespikes. In 2048, the Whitespikes appear essentially out of nowhere and start wiping out humanity. In 2051, they manage to cobble together a time machine (the Jumplink) to 2022. So, naturally, they start recruiting people from the past to help fight the war in the future. We follow family man and ex-Green Beret Dan Forester as he is drafted to fight in the Tomorrow War.",
                    "review": "This movie was jolly time travel alien war fun. Great creature effects, solid action setpieces, and a fair number of decent ideas. Also JK Simmons and Sam Richardson are wonderful. The time travel is perfectly consistent, if not particularly complex.",
                    "critique": "It was not, I\u2019m afraid, a particularly smart movie. The vast majority of that is related to characters doing stupid things, but there were a few times where the laws of physics were avoided as well. By its nature, this post is going to be particularly critical of the movie. Nevertheless, I did enjoy it, and it\u2019s streaming free on Amazon Prime. If you have any interest in it at all, you should give it a try.",
                    "chronodynamics": "The chronodynamics are pretty straightforward: It is a branching timeline, with a portal linking the two branches. The portal\u2019s mouths move forward on both timelines at the same rate, the separation is always going to be 28 years.",
                    "strategy": "The humans of timeline A are down to a population of about 500,000, meaning 99.5% of the worldwide population has been killed. They manage to find a good point to go back to, the most globally televised event of the year: the World Cup.",
                    "tactics": "Once we assume that there\u2019s no victory in conventional warfare, it requires a paradigm shift in tactics. The missions should have all been aimed at the only known solution\u2013the female toxin.",
                    "screenplayIssues": "Dan\u2019s character arc needs to be better fleshed out. The toxin ended up being a big shaggy dog story. We spend half the movie developing this toxin that\u2019s supposed to end the war, and it ends up being irrelevant.",
                    "culturalReferences": "The Tomorrow War: It\u2019s not just a sci-fi movie, it\u2019s every sci-fi movie. We\u2019ve got elements from Edge of Tomorrow, Starship Troopers, Alien, and more."

                    "reviewerThoughts": "Diving into Sharp Objects was like peeling back layers of a very dark onion\u2014each revelation more unsettling than the last. Flynn\u2019s portrayal of small-town dynamics and the facade of Southern gentility hiding deep-seated dysfunctions was spot on. The characters, especially Camille, are deeply flawed, making them feel real and relatable, even when their actions are hard to digest. I appreciated the exploration of complex mother-daughter relationships and the generational trauma that can ensue. Adora\u2019s character, in particular, was both fascinating and horrifying, embodying a twisted form of maternal care that left me both enraged and empathetic towards Camille\u2019s plight. However, the novel\u2019s intense focus on psychological trauma and self-harm can be heavy, and there were moments when I had to pause and process the weight of the content. The pacing, while building suspense effectively, occasionally felt slow, especially when delving into Camille\u2019s internal struggles. Overall, Sharp Objects is a compelling read that delves deep into the psyche of its characters, offering a dark and twisted narrative that kept me engaged, even if it left me a bit unsettled at times."

A question inspired by the actor Bernard White (who played Sati\u2019s father in M2 and M3) and in the more recent past blogged this rant in defence of the third movie: \u201cI was able to do this the second time I saw THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. I have now seen it an additional 5 times. Making it an even 7. The movie is nothing, I mean nothing, short of brilliant. The depth and complexity is well worth the closer look, that, it seems to me, some of these critics were not willing to take. It seemed to me that they did not want to risk falling in love with this film. Why? I believe it has to do with betrayal. Not wanting to be betrayed, not wanting to buy into the overdone hype of the Warner Brothers Publicity Machine. Not wanting to reward this quiet underground discovery of theirs turned Hollywood Blockbuster. They will, of course, site things like \u201cwooden performances\u201d and \u201cclunky dialogue\u201d. An \u201cuneven and confusing storytelling\u201d that they feel amounts to a kind of sound and fury signifying nothing. I will not stop short of saying that with this movie as the culmination of this trilogy, we have seen the deepest and most complex original modern mythology to ever be put on film."

This suggests that the user is likely introspective, valuing films that provoke thought and reflection about personal experiences and emotional states. The choice of such a film indicates a tendency to engage with narratives that resonate on a personal level, hinting at a reflective personality.\n\n2. **Analytical:**  \n   The user's preference for thrillers with \"mind-bending\" stories, such as \"Shutter Island,\" indicates an analytical mindset. This suggests that they enjoy unraveling complex plots and psychological twists, which require critical thinking and attention to detail. The desire for a narrative that challenges the viewer's perception aligns with a personality that appreciates depth and intricacy in storytelling.\n\n3. **Preference for Complexity:**  \n   The user\u2019s enjoyment of films that explore relationships in a nuanced way, combined with their specific request for thrillers, suggests a preference for complex narratives over straightforward romantic plots. This indicates a personality that seeks depth and multifaceted experiences, both in film and potentially in life. They may be drawn to stories that reflect the complexities of human interactions rather than simplistic portrayals of love.\n\n4. **Non-traditional Romantic Views:**  \n   The user explicitly states they are \"not a fan of love movies,\" which suggests a non-traditional view of romance and relationships. This could indicate a belief that love stories often lack realism or depth, reflecting a more pragmatic or perhaps cynical outlook on romantic relationships. This trait may also suggest a preference for narratives that challenge conventional romantic tropes, favoring stories that explore emotional and psychological dimensions over idealized portrayals of love.\n\n5. **Appreciation for Unique Storytelling:**  \n   The specific mention of films like \"Drive\" and \"Lost in Translation\" indicates a taste for unique storytelling styles that may not conform to mainstream expectations. Both films are known for their distinctive visual styles and unconventional narratives, suggesting that the user values originality and creativity in cinema. This appreciation may extend beyond film into other areas of their life, indicating a personality that seeks out unique experiences and perspectives.\n\nOverall, the user's cinematic preferences reveal a thoughtful, analytical individual who values complexity and depth in storytelling, particularly in psychological thrillers and nuanced explorations of relationships, while maintaining a critical stance towards traditional romantic narratives."
