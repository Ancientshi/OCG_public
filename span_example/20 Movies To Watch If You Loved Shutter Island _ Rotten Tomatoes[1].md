# Spanned Content
To tackle the task, I will first identify the specific attributes from the provided Abstract Data Type (ADT) for the class `ThrillerMovie`. These attributes will guide the tagging of relevant segments in the article.

### Specify Types of Tag
The attributes from the ADT are:
1. **Name**: The title of the movie.
2. **Plot Complexity**: The intricacy of the plot.
3. **Psychological Depth**: Exploration of psychological themes and character motivations.
4. **Character Development**: How well characters are developed.
5. **Twists and Turns**: Unexpected plot developments.
6. **Themes**: Central ideas and messages of the film.
7. **Additional Information**: Supplementary details about the movie.

### Explanation
In the reformatted article, I have wrapped relevant segments with the `<AdditionalInformation>` tag since the original article does not provide specific details about movies that would fit the other attributes (like Name, Plot Complexity, etc.). The content primarily consists of news and lists, which do not directly correspond to the required attributes of a thriller movie. Therefore, I used the optional attribute to tag the relevant information.
