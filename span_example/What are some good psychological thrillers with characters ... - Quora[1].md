To tackle the task, I will first identify the specific attributes from the provided Abstract Data Type (ADT) for the class `ThrillerMovie`. These attributes will guide the tagging process in the article.

### Specify Types of Tag
The attributes from the ADT are:
1. **Name**: This will be used to tag the title of the movie.
2. **Plot Complexity**: This will capture the intricacy of the plot.
3. **Psychological Depth**: This will reflect the exploration of psychological themes.
4. **Character Development**: This will assess how well characters are developed.
5. **Twists and Turns**: This will capture unexpected plot developments.
6. **Themes**: This will encompass the central ideas and messages of the film.
7. **Additional Information**: This will include any supplementary details about the movie.

Since the original article provided is fragmented and does not contain any specific information about a thriller movie, I will create a structured, reader-friendly version while ensuring that the tags are applied correctly based on the attributes.
