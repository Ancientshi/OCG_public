Detour19451h 6mApproved7.3 (21K)RateThe life of Al Roberts, a pianist in a New York nightclub, turns into a nightmare when he decides to hitchhike to Los Angeles to visit his girlfriend.DirectorEdgar G. UlmerStarsTom NealAnn SavageClaudia DrakeThe 1945 film noir Detour is told from the perspective of an unreliable protagonist who may be trying to justify his actions.

This movie is the best case of use of an Unreliable Narrator, which upon repeated viewings increases the charm of the movie.
- 2. The Usual Suspects19951h 46mMA8.5 (1.2M)Rate76MetascoreThe sole survivor of a pier shoot-out tells the story of how a notorious criminal influenced the events that began with five criminals meeting in a seemingly random police lineup.DirectorBryan SingerStarsKevin SpaceyGabriel ByrneChazz PalminteriThe 1995 film The Usual Suspects reveals that the narrator had been deceiving the characters in the movie, and hence the audience, by the story he is telling. The character Keyser Soze has something to do with the unreliable narrative.
- 3. Memento20001h 53mMA8.4 (1.4M)Rate83MetascoreLeonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, suffers from anterograde amnesia and uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife, which is the last thing he remembers.DirectorChristopher NolanStarsGuy PearceCarrie-Anne MossJoe PantolianoThe Narrator himself is not in the know of things happening around him. A Great example of unreliable narrator.
- 4. Fight Club19992h 19mR18+8.8 (2.4M)Rate67MetascoreAn insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into much more.DirectorDavid FincherStarsBrad PittEdward NortonMeat LoafIn the 1999 film Fight Club, it is revealed that the narrator suffers from dissociative identity disorder and that some events were fabricated. The Character Tyler Durden has something to do with the unreliable narrative.
- 5. Rashomon19501h 28mM8.2 (188K)Rate98MetascoreThe rape of a bride and the murder of her samurai husband are recalled from the perspectives of a bandit, the bride, the samurai's ghost and a woodcutter.DirectorAkira KurosawaStarsToshirô MifuneMachiko KyôMasayuki MoriIn Rashômon (1950), a Japanese crime drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, adapted from "In a Grove" (1921), uses multiple narrators to tell the story of the death of a samurai. Each of the witnesses describe the same basic events but differ wildly in the details, alternately claiming that the samurai died by accident, suicide, or murder. The term "Rashômon effect" is used to describe how different witnesses are able to produce contradictory accounts of the same event, though each version is presented with equal sincerity and each is plausible when considered independently of the others. The film does not select the "authentic" narrator from the differing accounts: at its conclusion, all versions remain equally plausible and equally suspect.
- 6. Shutter Island20102h 18mMA15+8.2 (1.5M)Rate63MetascoreTwo US marshals are sent to a mental institution on an inhospitable island in order to investigate the disappearance of a patient.DirectorMartin ScorseseStarsLeonardo DiCaprioEmily MortimerMark RuffaloThe Narrator is lying to himself and to the audience. Great Ending btw.
- 7. The Sixth Sense19991h 47mM8.2 (1.1M)Rate64MetascoreAfter being shot by a resentful former patient whom he failed to help, a Philadelphia child psychologist seeks redemption by treating a young boy with a disturbing secret.DirectorM. Night ShyamalanStarsBruce WillisHaley Joel OsmentToni ColletteThe Narrator himself doesn't know what is happening around him or even to him!!! Classic Unreliable Narrator.
- 8. Stage Fright19501h 51mG7.0 (17K)Rate62MetascoreA struggling actress tries to help a friend prove his innocence after he's accused of murdering the husband of a high-society entertainer.DirectorAlfred HitchcockStarsMarlene DietrichJane WymanRichard ToddThe 1950 Alfred Hitchcock film Stage Fright (1950) uses the device of unreliable narration by presenting the aftermath of a murder in a flashback, as told by the murderer. The details of the flashback provide an explanation which helps convince the innocent main protagonist of the film to help the murderer, believing him innocent.
- 9. Gone Girl20142h 29mMA15+8.1 (1.1M)Rate79MetascoreThe husband of a missing woman becomes the chief suspect in her disappearance.DirectorDavid FincherStarsBen AffleckRosamund PikeNeil Patrick HarrisAmy and Nick both are unreliable narrators, they are lying to the audience in the full first half of the movie.
- 10. Possessed19471h 48mPG7.1 (6.1K)RateAfter being found wandering the streets of Los Angeles, a severely catatonic woman tells a doctor the complex story of how she wound up there.DirectorCurtis BernhardtStarsJoan CrawfordVan HeflinRaymond MasseyIn Possessed (1947), Joan Crawford plays a woman who is taken to a psychiatric hospital in a state of shock. She gradually tells the story of how she came to be there to her doctors, which is related to the audience in flashbacks, some of which are later revealed to be hallucinations or distorted by paranoia
- 11. Forrest Gump19942h 22mM8.8 (2.4M)Rate82MetascoreThe history of the United States from the 1950s to the '70s unfolds from the perspective of an Alabama man with an IQ of 75, who yearns to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart.DirectorRobert ZemeckisStarsTom HanksRobin WrightGary SiniseIn the movie version of Forrest Gump (1994), the title character narrates his life story, and in the process naïvely refers to Apple Computer as a "fruit company" while also assuming that sustaining a "million dollar wound" meant that one would get paid for it. He also states that Jenny's dad treated her well because "he was always kissing and touching her and her sisters."
- 12. A Beautiful Mind20012h 15mM8.2 (1M)Rate72MetascoreA mathematical genius, John Nash made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a harrowing journey of self-discovery.DirectorRon HowardStarsRussell CroweEd HarrisJennifer ConnellyIn the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, it is eventually revealed that the narrator is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and many of the events he witnessed occurred only in his own mind.
- 13. Hero20021h 47mM7.9 (190K)Rate85MetascoreA defense officer, Nameless, was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.DirectorYimou ZhangStarsJet LiTony Leung Chiu-waiMaggie CheungIn the 2002 film Hero, the protagonist is identified as an unreliable narrator by the antagonist, who responds by constructing his own alternate version of the false story. In the last part of the film, the protagonist tells the real story, which explains his presence in the current situation.
- 14. American Psycho20001h 42mR7.6 (770K)Rate64MetascoreA wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.DirectorMary HarronStarsChristian BaleJustin TherouxJosh LucasPatrick Bateman makes "Money's" John Self look even more out of shape, when it comes to commenting on the big brands and applying his murderous hands to the unsuspecting and the vulnerable. Yet Ellis's great comment on consumerism and the death of high culture could just be a mirror to our own deluded thoughts, and Bateman nothing more than a sickly funny fantasist.
- 15. Primal Fear19962h 9mMA7.7 (257K)Rate47MetascoreA high-profile murder intrigues a publicity hungry lawyer.DirectorGregory HoblitStarsRichard GereLaura LinneyEdward NortonOne Character is lying to other characters and to the audience too, and everyone fell for his con.
- 16. The Lone Ranger20132h 30mM6.4 (248K)Rate37MetascoreNative American warrior Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice.DirectorGore VerbinskiStarsJohnny DeppArmie HammerWilliam FichtnerIn the 2013 film The Lone Ranger the narrator, Tonto (Johnny Depp), is identified quickly as potentially unreliable by a child attending a 1930s carnival sideshow during extensive questioning about the events leading to the origin of the Wild West character the child emulates. The child is wearing the costume identified with the fictional Western hero of radio, comics, films, and television. The events related by the narrator vaguely follow an alternative version of character development that occurred during its radio dramas and the beginning of its television series, but with novel disclosures of graphic details that occur as a series of flashbacks portraying the elderly Tonto's memories of the events. Along with the child, the audience is left to make their own judgments about the memories of Tonto.
- 17. Amarcord19732h 3mM7.8 (49K)RateA series of comedic and nostalgic vignettes set in a 1930s Italian coastal town.DirectorFederico FelliniStarsMagali NoëlBruno ZaninPupella MaggioThe title Amarcord apparently translates in Roman dialect as "I Remember", yet this chaotic film is in no way a straightforward recollection of childhood experiences. As Fellini himself once commented: "My films from my past, recount memories that are completely invented." The scatological jokes about belching, and farting coexist with an air of melancholy that's maintained by Nino Rota's evocative music. Fellini constantly draws our attention to the fact that we're watching a piece of fiction: the residents' stories are far from reliable, actors deliver their lines to camera, and the elderly narrator (Luigi Rossi) is interrupted by off-screen disruptions.
- 18. Big Fish20032h 5mPG8.0 (468K)Rate58MetascoreA frustrated son tries to determine the fact from fiction in his dying father's life.DirectorTim BurtonStarsEwan McGregorAlbert FinneyBilly CrudupAs William retraces his father's steps, revisiting his old stomping grounds and seeking out witnesses to what may or may not have happened, the truth is revealed to be anything but the simple black-and-white affair that any of us expected. What William discovers is that even his father's most over-arching conceits and purely fantastic fictions contain an essence of truth, an essence more valuable than what might be gleaned from a more literal version. Dad, of course, was right: reality is overrated. And all of those impossibly tall tales told over the course of the movie eventually come to resemble some enormous, sweet onion, with endless layers of story to be peeled away before getting to a core of meaning.
- 19. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari19201h 16mPG8.0 (73K)RateHypnotist Dr. Caligari uses a somnambulist, Cesare, to commit murders.DirectorRobert WieneStarsWerner KraussConrad VeidtFriedrich FeherThe deranged mind in Caligari was revealed through flashback.  Cinema moving backwards and forward in time, a quantum leap that thrust the oneiric engagement of the viewer within the frame of flickering images from passive observer to a participant who must engage actively in constructing a narrative.  The revealed unreliability of the narrative throwing the viewer into an abyss of incomprehension and confusion in movies like Un Chien Andolou.  A fractured kaleidoscope where meaning is continually undone and rewoven before the audience’s eyes.
- 20. High Tension20031h 31mR18+6.7 (80K)Rate42MetascoreBest friends Marie and Alexia decide to spend a quiet weekend at Alexia's parents' secluded farmhouse. But on the night of their arrival, the girls' idyllic getaway turns into an endless night of horror.DirectorAlexandre AjaStarsCécile de FranceMaïwennPhilippe NahonWe watch this story through the eyes of Marie (Cécile de France), who goes to stay with Alex (Maïwenn) and her family in a remote French house. 

Which is when a serial killer turns up. 

Spoiler :- In the film's shocking final twist, Marie is revealed as the serial killer – she merely created a separate persona in her mind to carry out her killings.
- 21. PoirotEpisode: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd(2000)1989–20131h 39mM7.3 (2.6K)RateTV EpisodePoirot comes out of retirement when his industrialist friend is brutally murdered a short while after a local widow who was suspected of killing her husband commits suicide.DirectorAndrew GrieveStarsDavid SuchetPhilip JacksonOliver Ford DaviesIn this classic Agatha Christi story there are multiple unreliable narratives. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was hailed as a cornerstone in the genre and is still known as “one of the most influential crime novels ever written,” as said by Howard Haycraft in 1941.
- 22. Lolita19622h 33mA7.5 (112K)Rate79MetascoreA middle-aged college professor becomes infatuated with a 14-year-old girl.DirectorStanley KubrickStarsJames MasonShelley WintersSue LyonNever straight with himself, let alone the ladies and gentlemen of the jury to whom he is ultimately addressing his words, Humbert Humbert arrived halfway through the 20th century, intent on justifying his appalling crime. Nabokov's syntactical genius is the one true triumph.
- 23. The Innocents19611h 40mPG7.7 (34K)Rate88MetascoreA young governess for two children becomes convinced that the house and grounds are haunted.DirectorJack ClaytonStarsDeborah KerrPeter WyngardeMegs JenkinsIs it a ghost story, or the tragic tale of a young woman undergoing a breakdown? Believing her two young charges are communing with the spirits of her two dead predecessors, the prim governess of Bly House becomes increasingly panic-stricken and erratic, until she's left with a dead boy in her arms.
- 24. Heart of Darkness19931h 40mPG5.7 (2.2K)RateTV MovieA trading company manager travels up an African river to find a missing outpost head and discovers the depth of evil in humanity's soul.DirectorNicolas RoegStarsTim RothJohn MalkovichIsaach De BankoléRight at the start we're told that Marlow likes to spin yarns. However, his tale of journeying up the Congo, in search first of ivory, and then the infamous Kurtz, is one of the most powerful stories in literature. Whether his story is strictly faithful becomes irrelevant, as Marlow ends up highlighting the moral corruption at the heart of all humans.
- 25. Money20102 epsMA15+5.4 (130)RateTV Mini SeriesJohn Self is good at making money, he's due to make a hell of a lot more. The only trouble is... he's better at spending it.StarsNick FrostVincent KartheiserEmma PiersonJohn Self is one of literature's most repulsively addictive narrators. The book might be subtitled "A Suicide Note", but it is in fact a love story, with Self dreaming up ever more extravagant ways to shed his wedge while pursuing entirely corruptible Selina Street, among others. The fact that Self might never have actually existed, revealed towards the end, is Amis's sly take on the death of the self.
