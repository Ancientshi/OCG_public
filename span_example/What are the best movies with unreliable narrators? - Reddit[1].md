# What are the best movies with unreliable narrators?

Discussion

An unreliable narrator is a storyteller who cannot be trusted. It may either intentionally deceive the audience or unknowingly mislead them, causing them to doubt the narrator's reliability as a storyteller.

As I can remember, the best movies I watched with unreliable narrators are:

- Fight Club
- Gone Girl
- Shutter Island
- Memento
- Mr. Robot (yes, it's a TV show, but still counts)
- The Usual Suspects

What are some others exemples of this narrative device?
