When it comes to scary movies, many love to go to the cinema for the chance to experience a jump scare and being at the edge of their seats. While that's common with horror films, a psychological thriller movie is a bit different. These films get inside your head, giving you a scare that stays long after the lights come back on. They also take some time for the true horror to build, sometimes with an unexpected twist the viewer never saw coming.

If you're looking for the best psychological thriller movies, we curated a list perfect for anyone who wants to take their time getting frightened. Some are from directors that have mastered the art of suspense — like Jordan Peele, Martin Scorsese and David Fincher. Others are famous book-to-movie adaptations, like The Shining, A Simple Favor or The Invisible Man. Whichever movie you decide to watch, just be prepared to not necessarily sleep at night. After all, what point is watching a psychological thriller if you're not thinking about it long after you go to bed?

Whether you're an avid psychological thriller fan or you're looking for a mind-bending movie to watch ahead of Halloween and spooky season, we've rounded up the all-time best psychological thrillers you can watch and stream now.
