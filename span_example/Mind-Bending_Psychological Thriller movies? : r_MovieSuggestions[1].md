### Explanation of the Tags Used:
- **MindBending**: Wrapped around the concept of mind-bending thrillers.
- **PsychologicalThemes**: Indicates that the request is for psychological thrillers.
- **Name**: Each movie title is wrapped in the `<Name>` tag to identify them as specific films of interest.

The rest of the article contains community and resource information that does not directly relate to the attributes of the `ThrillerMovie` class, so it remains untagged. The focus is on the request for movie suggestions, which aligns with the attributes specified in the ADT.
