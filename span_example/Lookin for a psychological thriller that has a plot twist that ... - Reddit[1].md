# Lookin for a psychological thriller that has a plot twist that even shocks a perceptive viewer

REQUESTING

Happy Saturday everyone. I am looking for a movie that both my boyfriend and I will agree on watching. He hates demonic themes, or anything to do with rape. I agree, but tend to pick movies with that theme. Seriously. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I really love thrillers of all kinds and get bored with other genres. So Im hoping y’all can recommend a movie that we’ll both enjoy. Plot twists always do the trick. But no full on action movies. I appreciate a psychological mind bending theme.

Thanks!
