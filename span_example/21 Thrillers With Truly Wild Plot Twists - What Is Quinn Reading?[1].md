# 21 Thrillers With Truly Wild Plot Twists

<!-- image -->

Originally published on Nov. 11, 2022.

Have you ever been reading a thriller in bed at, say, 11 PM, and you promise yourself you’re going to go to sleep in five minutes, but then a truly devastating, blow-your-hair-back twist goes down and suddenly it’s two AM and you’re sobbing/screaming/waking your fiancé up to tell them all about it? No? Just me? OK, WELL. Whether you want to or not, I figured it’s high-time to celebrate some of the books that left me the most mentally scarred. Because after surviving the pandemic, what ELSE would I want to dwell on, y’know?

Ever since the rampant success of novels like Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl, thrillers have been in a never-ending twist-off competition, constantly trying to out-do each other with jaw-dropping, out-of-nowhere plot explosions that don’t even necessarily make sense, most of the time. So this list is reserved solely for the novels that seamlessly slipped in twists that felt satisfying, earned, and of course, truly f*cking shocking. (And no, Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl are not included — they’re great and we all know it by now.)

### 'Stay Awake' by Megan Goldin

I've gotta be honest: at first I thought Stay Awake by Megan Goldin might be a watered-down rip-off of S. J. Watson's 2011 thriller Before I Go to Sleep. And, to be fair, there are some striking similarities: the heroine loses all memories of the previous day if she goes to sleep; she's surrounded by men who she can't fully trust; someone (who likely caused her memory loss in the first place) appears to want her dead. However, I have to give Goldin props — she takes a plot I could've sworn I'd seen before and creates a chilling, compulsively readable thriller with plenty of new things to fall in love with (and get freaked out by).

### 'My Murder' by Katie Williams

If you want to get technical, everything in My Murder by Katie Williams really boils down to one simple question: “What if you had to solve your own murder?” (Hah, just kidding — it’s anything but simple.) For me, the book more than lives up to its inventive premise — the victim of a local serial killer is brought back from the dead by a government project, and begins to suspect not all is at it seems — delivering a twist that’s as bittersweet as it is surprising.

<!-- image -->

### 'The Quiet Girl' by S.F. Kosa

S.F. Kosa's The Quiet Girl follows a husband’s efforts to track down his missing wife, and is a bit of a psychological mind-f*ck, to say the least. It kept me guessing quite literally until the last chapter.

<!-- image -->

### 'The Night Shift' by Alex Finlay

This fast-paced novel about a pair of Final Girls trying to figure out the person behind a new, vicious massacre is good as hellllll. It’s a thriller designed to shock and awe, so of course there are some occasionally eye-roll-worthy moments. But it’s excellently plotted with pulse-pounding twists that don’t feel forced or out of the left field’s left field (for the most part).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'Hidden Pictures' by Jason Rekulak

I truly think that the eerie Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulakis one of those twisty novels that is best read with as little beforehand knowledge about the ins and outs of the story as possible. It’s entertaining and engaging, with Rekulak deftly moving the story along at a fast clip, leading to a jaw-dropping, polarizing twist.

<!-- image -->

### 'When No One Is Watching' by Alyssa Cole

When No One Is Watching gives Brooklyn’s growing gentrification problem an even more horrifying spin in this thriller, which has shades of Rear Window and Get Out. It’s not my favorite book in the world, but there’s no denying it packs a twisty punch.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'The Good Girl' by Mary Kubica

Mary Kubica's The Good Girl is a fast-paced, taut thriller revolving around a high-profile kidnapping case in Chicago: Mia Dennett, the 20-something daughter of a prominent judge, is abducted by a strange man and held for ransom. Rather than telling the story from Mia’s perspective in captivity, the novel sees things through the eyes of Mia's anxiety-ridden mom, the world-weary detective assigned to her case, and, most importantly, the desperate man holding her hostage. It moves at a breakneck pace, and the last, “oh DAMN” twist has always stayed with me.

### 'The Long Weekend' by Gilly MacMillan

Regardless of my ultimate feelings about The Long Weekend, I have to hand it to author Gilly Macmillan: she clearly set out to do the absolute f*cking most when it came to this twisty, unpredictable thriller, and she succeeded. Really, really, really succeeded. Did she sit down before writing this story — about a girl’s trip gone awry when a mysterious note threatening the lives of their husbands is delivered to their isolated retreat — and say to herself, “how many truly unhinged characters I can conceivably squeeze into one novel?” It certainly seems so. (And I’m grateful for the choice, oop.)

<!-- image -->

### 'The Child' by Fiona Barton

Super intense mystery alert! When the decades-old bones of an infant are discovered at a construction site in London in Fiona Barton’s The Child, journalist Kate Waters sets out to uncover the identity of the baby — could it be the same child who was stolen from a maternity ward in a local hospital decades earlier, but never found?

### 'In a Dark, Dark Wood' by Ruth Ware

Bad bachelorette parties usually involve Vegas, too much vodka, and a crying bride-to-be wearing a penis headband. Well, that’s not quite what the heroine of Ruth Ware's A Dark, Dark Wood experiences, but after reading it, I’d take a rough Vegas trip any day. In this twisty thriller, Leonora, a reclusive writer, agrees to attend the ‘hen do’ for a high school pal she hasn't spoken to in years, and soon finds old resentments and bitter feuds bubbling back up to the surface, ending in a shocking act of violence.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'The Silent Patient' by Alex Michaelides

I don’t even want to say too much about The Silent Patient, a truly shocking psychological thriller, for fear of spoiling even a teensy, tiny bit of it, but the gist is this: a woman's gruesome act of violence against her husband comes to the attention of a therapist, who falls deep into an obsession to uncover her motive. I know this book has been hyped to hell and back, at this point, but I really do think it lives up to its acclaim.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'His &amp; Hers' by Alice Feeney

I wasn’t necessarily a huge fan of His &amp; Hers by Alice Feeny, but there’s no denying that this story is layered with twist after wild twist. It begins with a murder in a small, quintessentially British village, which leads a detective and a reporter assigned to cover the case down a dangerous path.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'The Wife Between Us' by Greer Hendricks &amp; Sarah Pekkanen

This book is jaw-dropping and disorienting in the best possible way — The Wife Between Us is a cat and mouse game, of sorts, between a jealous ex-wife and the pretty young woman who’s replaced her. But what if all is not as it seems? Dun, dun, DUNNNN.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'It's Always the Husband' by Michele Campbell

I really wish I could erase this book from my mind completely just so I can have the pleasure of reading it with fresh, innocent eyes one more time. It’s Always the Husband is an ode to the kinds of friendships that burn bright and fast before flaming out in disastrous ways. Like, for example, ending with a murder on a bridge. Yikes.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'The Seven Visitations of Sydney Burgess' by Andy Marino

Prepare yourself, because reading The Seven Visitations of Sydney Burgess by Andy Marino feels like falling into a particularly grim fever dream. And I don’t necessarily mean that in a bad way! But this book is trippy, and leans harder and harder into stomach-turning body horror with each passing chapter as it sets up a twisty, devastating resolution.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'We Were Liars' by E. Lockhart

I brought this book on a vacation, and spent a few very intense hours ignoring my friends, the beach, the sun, and even the extremely loud people under the umbrella next to me as I ripped through this bleak, hypnotic, and incredibly suspenseful novel about a group of four young friends’ whose bond turns destructive. Go get We Were Liars and then settle in — you won’t be moving anytime soon.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'The Last Word' by Taylor Adams

This eerie, claustrophobic thriller from the author of No Exit (another book with top-tier twists, btw) introduces us to a woman in a remote beach house who begins to wonder if an author is retaliating because of her one-star review of his book. It’s a fun read, and does a solid job of creating a tense atmosphere while ramping up the psychological suspense. To be fair, I did have some issues with it overall, but similar to No Exit, Adams’ method of blending gut-churning fear with jaw-dropping twists is undeniably effective.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'Darling Rose Gold' by Stephanie Wrobel

For a while there I was really burned out on the Munchausen syndrome by proxy obsession in pop culture (looking at you, Ryan Murphy), but then Darling Rose Gold came along and changed my mind. The story: After serving five years in prison, Patty Watts (who spent years convincing her daughter, Rose Gold, that she was ill even though she was perfectly healthy) gets out with nowhere to go and begs her daughter to take her in. The entire community is shocked when Rose Gold says yes, and then…..well, I’ll leave that for YOU to find out.

### 'Shutter Island' by Dennis LeHane

If you haven’t already seen the movie adaption of Shutter Island, then go pick up this thrilling, atmospheric mystery about a US Marshal who’s sent to investigate the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in the 1950s. When the truth is finally revealed, you'll be rereading the final passages over and over again to make sure you aren't going crazy, too.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'The Hand That Feeds You' by A.J. Rich

This book is WILD, starting with a woman coming home to her apartment to find her fiancé mauled to death, and her normally docile dog covered in blood. But the real story in The Hand That Feeds You is, somehow, a whole lot deeper (and crazier) than that.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

### 'Sharp Objects' by Gillian Flynn

All hail Gillian Flynn, queen of batshit-crazy plot twists that somehow feel smart and well-earned, as well as jaw-dropping, all at once. You can’t really have a list of thrillers featuring shocking moments without her, you know? Sharp Objects is a personal fave (I really love Dark Places, too, fwiw) and packs one of the biggest literary gut-punches I’ve stumbled across in quite a while. Here’s the rundown, if you haven’t read it yet or seen the (equally excellent) TV adaptation: as journalist Camille Preaker reports on the unsolved murder of a preteen girl and the disappearance of another in her tiny hometown, she unearths disturbing memories as well as gruesome revelations regarding the killings.
