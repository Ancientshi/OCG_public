To tackle the task, I will first identify the specific attributes from the provided Abstract Data Type (ADT) for the class `ThrillerMovie`. The attributes are:

1. **Name**: The title of the movie.
2. **Plot Complexity**: The intricacy of the plot.
3. **Psychological Depth**: The exploration of psychological themes and character motivations.
4. **Character Development**: How well the characters are developed.
5. **Twists and Turns**: The unexpected plot developments.
6. **Themes**: The central ideas and messages of the film.
7. **Additional Information**: Optional details that enhance understanding.

Next, I will rewrite the original article while incorporating these attributes as XML tags where relevant. The goal is to maintain the original meaning and content while making it more structured and reader-friendly.

    <title>The 10 Most Mind-Bending Psychological Thrillers Of The 21st Century</title>
    <author>by</author>
    <introduction>
        <text>Psychological Thrillers are not a new genre of movies and have been around for decades, however, the 21st century has seen the refinement of this category with movies which are beyond praiseworthy. What sets this genre apart is its unique ability to engage the audience in such a way that they feel the emotional turmoil of the characters to an exceedingly empathetic level and see how they cope and navigate challenges they are faced with.</text>
        <text>Not only can movies of this genre be unsettling, but they also excel at leaving the audience full of questions, and second guessing themselves, and allow them to expand the parameters of what they think is going on with the plot. With adept use of misdirection, unreliable narrators, vivid, and often non-linear storylines, these movies challenge the audience’s scope for understanding the convoluted plots.</text>
    </introduction>

    <movie>
        <Name>Nocturnal Animals</Name>
        <PlotComplexity>High</PlotComplexity>
        <PsychologicalDepth>Explores guilt and emotional turmoil</PsychologicalDepth>
        <CharacterDevelopment>Strong character arcs, especially Susan and Tony</CharacterDevelopment>
        <TwistsAndTurns>Multiple unexpected developments</TwistsAndTurns>
        <Themes>Regret, betrayal, isolation, revenge</Themes>
        <AdditionalInformation>
            <text>From what was only Tom Ford’s second movie, came one of the most disturbing features of the 2010s. With its immaculate attention to detail, heavy use of symbolism and glamorous costuming, it’s easy to see why Nocturnal Animals is such a cult classic. With compelling performances by the star-studded cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon (his role earning him an Academy award nomination), Isla Fisher and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the movie plays out all its tricks on the minds of the audience.</text>
            <text>The movie follows a narrative within a narrative approach by playing out the events of Tony’s (Jake Gyllenhaal) book as his ex-wife Susan (Amy Adams) reads the bone chilling manuscript, and deals with fighting her guilt and resurfacing feelings for her ex-husband.</text>
        </AdditionalInformation>

        <Themes>Guilt, punishment, mental health</Themes>
        <AdditionalInformation>
            <text>Starring Christian Bale as what is probably the most grueling character he has ever played and is directed by Brad Anderson, who you may know from movies like, ‘Fractured’ and ‘Session 9’, The Machinist remains his best work to date.</text>
            <text>Christian Bale lost 62 pounds and went on a strict diet of apples, water and coffee daily for the movie, playing the insomniac factory worker, Trevor Reznik.</text>

        <TwistsAndTurns>Intriguing and unexpected</TwistsAndTurns>
        <Themes>Duality, obsession, identity</Themes>
        <AdditionalInformation>
            <text>The second of Jake Gyllenhaal movies to make this list, Enemy, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is perhaps his most peculiar and hard to understand on a first watch.</text>
            <text>Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history professor who lives a quiet life with his partner Mary (Mélanie Laurent). While watching a movie, he discovers an actor, Anthony Claire, who looks strikingly like him, and tracks him down and begins to stalk him out of curiosity.</text>

        <Themes>Trauma, guilt, mental illness</Themes>
        <AdditionalInformation>
            <text>Adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane and directed by Martin Scorcese, Shutter Island is regarded as one of the most critically acclaimed acting projects of Leonardo DiCaprio’s career.</text>
            <text>The movie is set in the 1950s and begins with Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), a U.S Marshall and his partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) who are tasked with investigating the disappearance of a patient from an asylum for the criminally insane at the deserted Shutter Island.</text>

        <AdditionalInformation>

            <text>Portman plays the role of the determined ballerina Nina Sayers whom above all else wants to be cast as the lead role of White/Black swan in the upcoming performance of Swan Lake.</text>
