### Task Description
Your task is to generate just one query for searching, taking account for the [In Context Situation].


### In Context Situation
{{in_context_situation}}

### Analytical Steps
(1) Imagine the scenario in which the user is asking a question.
(2) Simulate the user's thought process: What kind of query would they type into a search engine to easily find the information they are looking for?

### Important Instructions
(1) Note: Just return single query, no else redundant words.

### Response Format
You can think through the process step by step and ultimately generate a section titled 'Generated Query'. This section must be enclosed within triple backticks (```json ... ```). The 'Generated Query' should be formatted as JSON using the following structure. For example:
```json
{
    "query":"xxx"
}
```
