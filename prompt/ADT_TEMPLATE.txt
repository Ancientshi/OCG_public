### Task Description  
Your task is to understand user’s [Narrative Query]. Then specify what type of recommendations they user need. Then design appropriate Abstract Data Type (ADT) for the candidate item. ADT inclues the ClassName and Attributes. Some attributes are `required` and others are `optional`. The attributes should be dynamically adjusted according to the user’s concerns, and the key information that the user cares about must be `required`.

### Narrative Query
{{query}}


### Analytical Steps
(1) Integrate the insights gained from the query to identify the core attributes that the candidate item should possess.
(2) For each identified attribute, furnish a detailed rationale that elucidates how the attribute aligns with the user’s requirements while ensuring adaptability for dynamic adjustments.

### Important Instructions
(1) All analyses must be strictly derived from the narrative query; no extraneous information should be incorporated.
(2) Each inference and attribute selection must be supported by clear, logical evidence, ensuring the overall reasoning is both coherent and robust.
(3) The design of the Abstract Data Type (ADT) should be responsive to the user’s specific concerns, balancing the necessity of key attributes with the flexibility to accommodate optional requirements. The attribute "Name" and "AdditionalInformation" must should be included and they are mandatory. The "AdditionalInformation" serves as a repository for supplementary descriptive details about the candidate that are not of primary importance. The attribute 'AdditionalInformation' should be JSON format.
(4) For movie recommendation, the attribute ReleaseYear is required.

### Response Format
Class Name: {classname}
Attributes:
Name, Required
{attribute1}, {Required/Optional}
{attribute2}, {Required/Optional}
...
AdditionalInformation, Required

### Additional Notes
1. If asking for studying aboard programe recommendation, Name need to be {programe name} at {university name}. Please add this note to the ADT to instruct the format of the Name attribute. Please using the full name of university instead of abbreviation.

### Example
Below are examples, you should adjust according to context.
