{{ADT}}

### Article

### Important Instructions
(1) The primary objective is to extract instance object, the Abstract Data Type [ADT] is already defined and you should strictly follow. 
(2) The key information and relevant attribute in [Article] is already tagged with XML. You should pay special attenstion to these highlighted key words.
(3) You generated content for the attribute should keep the original XML tag.
(4) Do not fabricate informationâ€”if an extracted instance object has incomplete attributes, keep them as NOT FOUND.
(5) For the attribute 'Additional Information', it should be a JSON format containing supplementary descriptive details about the candidate. Or be an empty json.

### Your Answer Should Follow These Steps
(1) Read the [ADT] carefully and understand the defined data structure
(2) Read the [Article] then specific your founded instance object, list the Name attribute. 
(3) Write a section named 'Candidate List', followed by a json format answer.

You can articulate your thought process step by step in free text. However, at the end, you must generate a section titled 'Candidate List'. This section must be enclosed within triple backticks (```json) and (```). The 'Candidate List' should be formatted as JSON using the following structure:
```json
[
    {
        "attribute1": "{content}",
        "attribute2": "{content}",
        ...,
        "Additional Information" : {
            "xxx" : "xxx",
            ...
        }
    },
