Every month we watch a couple of films that share a so called \"non-traditional\" narrative structure. For example, last month we watched films that are have a non likeable main character. We watched Naked by Mike Leigh and Seul Contre Tous by Gaspar Noé.\n\nWe get together and discuss whether we like the this so called \"non traditional narrative structure\" or not. We also discuss what the advantages and disadvantages may be. For example, last month we discussed that even though it is interesting being presented with a character that is very flawed, it can also cause you as a viewer to distance yourself from the film. Because you don't like the character you don't feel like following the story anymore. I especially had this experience with Seul Contre Tous, which I found unenjoyable.\n\nMore examples for upcoming editions:\n\n- \"Parallel worlds\" - Paprika or Millennium Actress by Satoshi Kon, The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky\n- \"Unreliable main character\" - The Father by Florian Zeller, Enemy by Denis Villeneuve\n- \"Fragmented editing\" - Bad Timing by Nicholas Roeg, Spring Breakers by Harmony Korine\n- \"Meta film\" - Adaptation. by Spike Jonze, Symbiopsychotaxiplasm Take One by William Greaves\n- \"Hyperlink movies\" - Exotica by Atom Egoyan, Amores Perros by Alejandro G. Iñárritu\n\nThese are the themes and the films that we came up with thus far. I was wondering if you might be able to come up with more themes, or maybe more film examples within the themes I already came up with.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of August 13, 2022\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of August 2022\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2022\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

portal\n- Lists portal\n\n- List of stories set in a future now in the past\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ The film uses the real-world Anno Domini or Common Era calendar instead of the \"After Guild\" or \"A.G.\" used in the books, even though the numbers used are the same.\n- ^ a b The Villeneuve Dune series uses the same \"After Guild\" time scale as the books, however when A.G. corresponds in CE in the films is unclear. The CE estimate correlates with the world of the books.\n- ^ Even though \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" takes place a year after the events of the original, in 1992, it was also released in 1992.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The Apple (1980)\".

I made a post a few days ago about how T3 had ruined the franchise on account of it being the first major dip in quality in the series and permanently fracturing the Terminator legacy, but that was before I sat through the two hour long insult to my intelligence that was Terminator Genisys. I put off watching this movie for years because I knew it was bad, but holy shit I had no idea it was THIS bad. The moment Sarah Conner swiftly killed off the original T-800 with a single shot I knew I was in for some absolute bullshit. T3 and Salvation are objectively not good films, but by comparison are masterpiece works of art next to this abject failure of a motion picture. Without having seen Dark Fate I can comfortably say Genisys is the worst Terminator movie, because there is absolutely no way DF can be worse. It’s simply impossible. This is not a Terminator film, but an absolute mockery of the original and a disgrace to the series overall. 1/10. Do better."

            "Plot Complexity": "Naked is a 1993 British black comedy drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh and starring David Thewlis as Johnny, a loquacious intellectual, philosopher and conspiracy theorist. The film won several awards, including Best Director and Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Naked marked a new career high for Leigh as a director and made the then-unknown Thewlis an internationally recognised star. In a Manchester alley, Johnny is having sex with a woman, who initially encourages him but then protests that he is hurting her, pushes him away, and runs off vowing that \"her Bernard\" will get vengeance on him for this. Johnny grabs his things from his apartment, steals a car, and flees to Dalston, a \"scrawny, unpretentious area\" in east London. He seeks refuge at the home of Louise, a former girlfriend from Manchester, who is not happy to see him. Louise works as a file clerk and lives with two flatmates, the unemployed Sophie, whom she calls her \"hippy-dippy friend\", and the primary tenant Sandra, a nurse who is away in Zimbabwe. Johnny seduces Sophie while treating Louise coldly, but soon tires of her. He leaves and walks around central London, expounding his world view at length to anyone who will listen. Among the people he meets are Archie, a young Scottish man looking for his girlfriend Maggie on Brewer Street, and Brian, a security guard who looks after an empty office building at night, which Johnny calls \"the most tedious job in England\", while planning to move to a seaside cottage in the future. After pursuing a drunk woman and rejecting her when he notices a skull and crossbones tattoo on her shoulder, Johnny follows a young cafe worker home but is thrown out when she starts crying. He hitches a ride with a man hanging posters around town until the man, exasperated by Johnny's nonstop haranguing, throws him down in the street and kicks him before driving off with Johnny's duffel bag containing his clothes and books. Johnny wanders the streets and is severely beaten by a wandering gang of thugs. He returns to Louise's residence to find that their landlord Jeremy (aka Sebastian), a psychopathic and amoral yuppie and rapist, has let himself into the apartment. Jeremy raped Sophie and dropped several hundred pounds for her 'services'. Sophie is desperate to get Jeremy out of the house, but she and Louise fear the police will not help. They try to keep the injured Johnny quiet, but he has a fit that awakens the sleeping Jeremy. Sandra returns early from her trip. Though horrified by the state of the apartment, she tends to Johnny's injuries. Louise drives Jeremy from the house by feigning interest in him but then pulling a knife on him. Feeling desolate and rejected, Sophie flees the house with her few possessions. Louise and Johnny seemingly reconcile and discuss returning to Manchester together, but once she leaves for work, Johnny steals the money and hobbles out into the streets.",

In fact, while we’re on the subject, another thing that really gets on my cinematic tits are movies featuring impassive-faced heroes pulling off ludicrous gymnastics that choked up the blockbuster scene in the wake of The Matrix. So you can imagine how stoked I must have been when trying to stir up enthusiasm to make it through Æon Flux, a relentlessly awful adaptation of the MTV animated series of the same name that spends the entirety of its runtime doing everything in its power to make you hate it with the fire of a thousand suns.",

By 2415, humans, numbering a mere five million, have gathered to live within the walled city-state known as Bregna which is run by a Congress of scientists. Although the place is kind of nice for a dystopian city located on an inhospitable earth, there are numerous reports of mysterious disappearances and the population is plagued by nightmares. Because this is a future dystopian movie, we meet Æon Flux, a cat-suited warrior for the rebel organisation known as the Monicans, whose successful mission to take out a surveillance station is marred by the fact that her beloved sister was mistakenly murdered while under suspicion of being an agent for the resistance. Consumed with vengeance, Æon takes a mission to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild, but like every movie similar to this that's ever been made, not only is there a mystery villain out there pulling everybody’s strings, but Æon has a hidden past that’s linked directly into the growing mental issues the people of Bregna are suffering from.",

Read our extensive list of rules for more information on other types of posts like fan-art and self-promotion, or message the moderators if you have any questions.\n\n# In Time (2011) is a hilarious waste of great sci fi ideas.\n\nThis movie is an example of a compelling science fiction setting being wasted and/or botched. The plot is essentially that people have digital clocks on their forearms that count down to their death. Life is free until age 25 then you get one year. After that you need to earn, steal, recharge it however you can. Will (Justin Timberlake) gets a huge time donation from a random rich guy and a movie ensues.\n\nI loved the idea of time being a currency, and the idea that people don't age past 25 so you can't tell who in a family is daughter, mom or grandma. But after about the first twenty minutes it falls into recycling tried and worn movie cliches. A high stakes poker game, bad guys dressed in black leather, protagonist's father being some sort of folklore hero. etc\n\nIf you stick it out for a while, things start to get pretty funny. The plotholes and conveniences just compound on each other until nothing makes sense. Here's some examples.\n\n- Cillian Murphy is a Timekeeper, a type of police whose job and reason for targeting Will are both unclear. Essentially, Will has time, but is not rich and therefore must be guilty of something. But later on, the gangster character explains that the Timekeepers let him kill and steal as much as he wants, provided that it's done in the ghetto neighborhood. Even though that's where Will met the rich guy who gifted him a hundred years. In fact, the move only happens because Will interrupts the gangster from stealing it for himself.\n- There's talk about how distributing time will make the system unstable. But after Will robs a time bank and lets the whole neighborhood steal as much as they want, the timekeepers don't care about collecting any of it. They just let everyone walk free. Also it's convenient that all this bank robbing does not encounter a single armed guard or locked bank vault.\n- They hint that Will's dad was some sort of robin hood character, though it is never fully explained and has no impact on the story whatsoever. There's dialogue from evil rich people about how giving away time is intolerable, but no one seems to care that there's a mission across the street giving it away for free.\n- Throughout the movie Will is running away from Timekeepers, but they seem to have a method of tracking any and all time transactions going on, displayed on a big switchboard on the wall. Yet they didn't know how Will got his extra time in the first place. Or that he won more at a casino. He sits there and explains through exposition what the audience and characters should already know.\n- It is absurdly easy to steal each other's time. We see it taken by force or from sleeping people a few times, and seemingly no one can stop it. However, they establish 'fighting' as a common thing. Wherein two people hold hands and use willpower to determine who wins and collects the other person's time. Like a mental arm wrestle. (edit: seems to be a mix of mental and physical). That means that people can stop a time transfer, but don't? And can't put on a password or a secure gauntlet/wallet?\n- The timekeeper antagonist (Murphy) repeats over and over that he has been doing this job for fifty years. And there's hints of him having a change of heart, or some sort of character arc. But then he drops dead during the final confrontation because he FORGOT to refill his own time. Rather than just arrest our main characters, he does the talking villain thing and it literally kills him. Oh, and Will is then able to recharge himself from the police car. They just wire him another man's paycheque and no one's the wiser.\n- Amanda Seyfried is in the film too, but she doesn't have any character traits aside from wearing skimpy clothing and giant anime-worthy eyes that take up most of her head. She's a rich girl who becomes a criminal to to get back at daddy. Though she does shoot the timekeeper, who seemed to be trying to take them in alive and unharmed, and was basically just doing his job. Luckily bullets don't really hurt in this universe so he's okay.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of February 27, 2020\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of February 2020\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2020\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

Every week, the filmmakers held a vote for their favorites.\n\n- Goofs(at around 1h 14 mins) Gipsy Danger is said to be immune to an EMP because it is \"nuclear powered\" and therefore \"analog\". This would be nearly impossible as the two have nothing to do with one another. Most nuclear reactors have many digital parts and computers controlling them. Furthermore, the cockpit of Gipsy Danger is filled with what appear to be digital computers.\n\n- QuotesStacker Pentecost: Today. Today... At the edge of our hope, at the end of our time, we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves, but in each other. Today there is not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone. Not today. Today we face the monsters that are at our door and bring the fight to them! Today, we are *canceling* the apocalypse!\n\n- Crazy creditsAt the end of the closing credits, a Kaiju roar is heard.\n\n- Alternate versionsIn the North American release, the scene where Mako is introduced has her and Raleigh speaking in Japanese. Some international releases have this scene dubbed in English - not in Denmark and Norway though, where the Japanese is intact. To the exception of France where all Japanese dialogs are subtitled even in french dubbed versions.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in ReelzChannel Specials: Richard Roeper's Red Hot Summer (2013)\n\n- SoundtracksJust Like Your Tenderness\nWritten by Liang Hong Zhi\nExecutive Produced by Ivy Wang and Mathew D\nPerformed by Luo Xiaoxuan\nCourtesy of R2G Music/Coden Music\n\n### User reviews1.3K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Enjoyable monster movie that doesn't pretend to be anything else\n\nPart of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.\n\nIt is easy to wring one's hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it – it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well – unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can't even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn't get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got – the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.\n\nThe cast are not particularly famous but it doesn't matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.\n\nIt isn't a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters – that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers. If this sounds like your thing then this will hit the spot no problem.\n\n- bob the moo\n- Nov 2, 2013\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ35\n\n- How long is Pacific Rim?Powered by Alexa\n- What is 'Pacific Rim' about?\n- Is 'Pacific Rim' based on a book?\n- Why do they use two pilots?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - July 11, 2013 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Mexico\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Japanese\n    - Cantonese\n    - Mandarin\n- Also known as\n    - Titanes del Pacífico\n- Filming locations\n    - Papenburger Meyer Shipyard, Lower Saxony, Germany(Factory, where the Jaeger are built)\n- Production companies\n    - Warner Bros.\n    - Legendary Entertainment\n    - Double Dare You (DDY)\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $190,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $101,802,906\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $37,285,325\n    - Jul 14, 2013\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $411,002,906\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 11 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The film is the first installment in The Maze Runner film series and was produced by Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers, and T. S. Nowlin. The film stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Will Poulter and Patricia Clarkson. The story follows sixteen-year-old Thomas, portrayed by O'Brien, who awakens in a rusty elevator with no memory of who he is, only to learn that he has been delivered to the middle of an intricate maze, along with many other boys, who have been trying to find their way out of the ever-changing labyrinth – all while establishing a functioning society in what they call the Glade.\n\nDevelopment of The Maze Runner began in January 2011 when Fox purchased the film rights to Dashner's novel with Gotham Group, Temple Hill Entertainment, TSG Entertainment as producers and Catherine Hardwicke intended to direct. In 2012, Ball was hired to direct the film adaptation after presenting an animated short film titled Ruin with a similar tone and was initially considered for a feature-length adaptation. Principal photography began in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on May 13, 2013, and officially concluded on July 12, 2013.\n\nThe Maze Runner was released on September 19, 2014, in the United States by 20th Century Fox. The film received positive reviews, with praise for Ball's direction, the actors' performances and the film's tone. Critics considered it to be better than most young adult book-to-film adaptations. The film was first at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing $32.5 million, making it the seventh-highest-grossing debut in September. The film earned over $348 million worldwide at the box office, against its budget of $34 million. A sequel, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, was released on September 18, 2015, in the United States. A third and final film, Maze Runner: The Death Cure, was released on January 26, 2018.\n\n## Plot\n\nA teenage boy awakens in an underground elevator without memory of his identity. A large group of male youths greets him in a large grassy area, called the \"Glade\", enclosed by massive stone walls. The \"Gladers\" have formed a rudimentary society, each taking on specialized roles. The boy learns that a vast maze encircles the Glade and is their only means of escape. During the day, designated \"Runners\" search the maze for an exit and return before its gate closes at sunset. After a fight with Gally, the boy remembers his name is Thomas.\n\nThomas is attacked by Ben, a Runner who was stung and left delirious by a Griever, one of the biomechanical creatures that roam the maze at night. The Gladers force Ben into the maze, as there is no cure for his condition, and leave him to die.\n\nThe next morning, Alby, the Glade's leader, and Minho, the lead Runner, retrace Ben's steps inside the maze. However, as the sun sets, Minho reappears near the gate, dragging a badly injured Alby who has been stung. Unable to reach the Glade in time, Thomas runs into the maze to help, leaving all three trapped. Thomas is chased by a Griever, which he manages to lure into a closing passageway, crushing it. The three survive the night and return the next morning.\n\nA girl arrives in the elevator with two syringes of Griever anti-venom and a note saying she is the last to enter the Glade. She recognizes Thomas, but he does not remember her. Gally accuses Thomas of disrupting the peace between the Gladers and the Grievers and insists he be punished. However, Newt, Alby's second-in-command, designates Thomas as a Runner instead. Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the maze to locate the Griever's corpse and retrieve a mechanical device inside of it. Minho later shows Thomas a maze model based on previous explorations and explains that numbered sections open and close in a fixed sequence. Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a specific section of the maze. One of the anti-venom syringes is used on Alby, who recovers quickly. Minho and Thomas venture back into the maze with the device and discover a potential exit. However, a series of traps activate, forcing them to retreat.\n\nLater that night, the maze entrance remains open, and additional gates open up, allowing Grievers to invade the Glade. Alby, Zart, and many other Gladers are killed, leading Gally to blame Thomas for the chaos. Thomas, who has been experiencing fragmented memory flashes since his arrival, stabs himself with a severed Griever's stinger to recover his memories before receiving the last dose of the anti-venom. While unconscious, Thomas remembers that he and Teresa once worked for the World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD), the organization behind the maze, and that all the Gladers are being used as test subjects for an experiment. He awakens and reveals his past.\n\nHaving taken command overnight, Gally plans to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers, believing it will restore peace. However, several Gladers free them and enter the maze, while Gally and a few Gladers stay behind. Jeff and several other Gladers are killed by Grievers as the rest escape through the maze exit.\n\nThe Gladers eventually reach a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, the WCKD scientist, Ava Paige, explains that massive solar flares followed by a pandemic caused by the Flare virus has devastated the planet, and the Gladers were part of an experiment to find a cure for the virus. The recording ends with Paige shooting herself as armed personnel storm the lab. Gally, having been stung by a Griever while following the group, declares that they will never be free and fires a gun at Thomas. Minho spears Gally, but not before he fatally shoots Chuck. As Thomas mourns Chuck, masked soldiers arrive and escort them to a helicopter, which flies over a vast desert wasteland toward a ruined city.\n\nLater, the supposedly dead scientists gather in a room with Paige, who remarks that the experiment was a success and that the survivors are now entering Phase Two.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Dylan O'Brien as Thomas, the last male to enter the Glade\n- Kaya Scodelario as Teresa, the only female to ever enter the Glade, as well as the last Glader\n- Aml Ameen as Alby, the first to enter the Glade and the leader of the Gladers\n- Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt, second-in-command of the Gladers\n- Ki Hong Lee as Minho, the keeper of the runners\n- Will Poulter as Gally, the keeper of the builders\n- Patricia Clarkson as Ava Paige, the head of WCKD\n- Blake Cooper as Chuck, a very young Glader\n- Dexter Darden as Frypan, the cook\n- Jacob Latimore as Jeff\n- Chris Sheffield as Ben, a runner\n- Joe Adler as Zart\n- Randall D.

The studio initially considered a film adaptation of the short film, as it had the same tone of The Maze Runner novel they already planned to bring to the screen. Ball was then offered the chance to direct the novel adaptation.[5]\n\n### Griever design\n\nIn late 2012, director Wes Ball hired creature designer Ken Barthelmey to design the Grievers. Impressed by Barthelmey's test design, Ball asked him to add a mechanical scorpion tail. Barthelmey's inspirations for the Grievers included coconut crabs, caterpillars and piranhas. Barthelmey also worked on several Maze, Beetle Blade (cut from the film), and Crank designs.[6]\n\n### Casting\n\nFor the role of Teresa, Kaya Scodelario was Ball's first choice as she was \"fantastic\" and because he loved her in the TV show Skins. Dylan O'Brien, the lead role, was initially rejected by Ball. Ball recounts, \"Dylan was actually... I saw him early on, very early on and I overlooked him. It was a big learning experience there because I overlooked him because of his hair. He had Teen Wolf hair and I couldn't see past that and so we were looking for our Thomas and it's a tough role to make because he comes in as a boy and he leaves as a man, so it can't be like this badass action star that comes into this movie. It's about vulnerability upfront and then he comes out of it and comes into his own and then the next movies are about the leader that emerges from the group. So finally Fox says 'We just did this movie, The Internship. There's this kid that's in this thing. He's like 20 years old. We think he's kind of got something.' So I watched his tape and was like 'Wait a minute, I've seen this kid before.' I looked him up online and there was one picture of him with a totally shaved head and it's this sweet vulnerable-looking kid and I was like 'Whoa, interesting.' I said, 'Wait a minute, he's just so familiar and I looked back at my old audition tapes, which we had thousands of, and there's Dylan. That guy I said 'No, definitely not him.' So we brought him back in and we started to talk with him and I'm like 'he's the coolest dude ever.'\" Blake Cooper entered the film via Twitter. Ball revealed a lot on Twitter, and many kids wanted to be Chuck. Cooper constantly bugged Ball, until Ball told him to give his tape to his casting director, and Ball was impressed by Cooper's tape and cast him.[5]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography started in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on May 13, 2013,[7] and officially ended on July 12, 2013.[8] Post-production on the film was completed in June 2014.\n\n### Soundtrack\n\nComposed by John Paesano, the soundtrack consists of 21 tracks and was released on September 16, 2014.[9]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was originally set to be released on February 14, 2014.[10] On October 5, 2013, the film was pushed back.[11] IMAX theaters released the film on September 19, 2014.[12]\n\n### Marketing\n\nKaya Scodelario and Dylan O'Brien at a panel for the film at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEleven character cards for the film were released in July 2013. Starting in January 2014, director Wes Ball released one image from the film once a week, leading up to the film's first trailer released on March 17, 2014.[13] A viral marketing campaign launched by 20th Century Fox began on April 16, 2014. The campaign is a website featuring the main characters while focusing on WCKD, an organization in Dashner's novel series of the same name. The website has the domain wckdisgood.com.[14]\n\nOn June 26, 2014, O'Brien tweeted that the original The Maze Runner book would be re-released with a new book cover based on the film's poster.[15] On July 29, 2014, the second trailer for the film was released exclusively on Yahoo! Movies.[16]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $102,427,862 in North America and more than $245.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $348.3 million.[17]\n\nPrior to its release in the U.S. and Canada, box office analysts predicted the film would be a box office success, citing effective marketing, good word-of-mouth publicity and a solid release date. Preliminary reports predicted the film would open with takings of over $30–32 million in North America.[18][19][20][21] According to movie-ticket sale website Fandango, The Maze Runner was the biggest seller accounting for more than 50% of early tickets sales.[22] The film was released on September 19, 2014, in the United States and Canada across 3,604 locations and over 350 IMAX theaters.[23][24] It earned $1.1 million from Thursday night shows,[25] and $11.25 million on its opening day.[26] It topped the box office on its opening weekend with $32.5 million of which 9% of the gross came from IMAX theaters.[27] Its opening weekend gross is the seventh highest for a film released in September,[28][29] and the 18th highest for a young-adult book adaptation.[30] The film earned a total of $102,272,088 at the North American box office becoming the 26th-highest-grossing film of 2014 in the U.S. and Canada.[31]\n\nOutside North America, the film debuted in five countries a week prior to its North American release and earned a total of $8.3 million.[32] The film had a similar success overseas during its wide-opening second weekend earning $38 million from 7,547 screens in 51 markets. It opened in South Korea with $5.5 million – higher than the openings of The Hunger Games and Divergent,[33] the UK, Ireland and Malta with $3.4 million behind Gone Girl,[34][35] and China with $14.58 million behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[36] Other high openings were witnessed in Russia and the CIS ($5.75 million), France ($5.2 million), Australia ($3.4 million), Mexico ($2.6 million), Taiwan ($2.2 million) and Brazil ($2 million).[32][33][37]\n\nIt became the third-highest-grossing film of all time in Malaysia for Fox (behind Avatar and X-Men: Days of Future Past).[38][39][40]\n\n### Critical response\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes assigns the film a score of 65% based on 175 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's consensus states: \"With strong acting, a solid premise, and a refreshingly dark approach to its dystopian setting, The Maze Runner stands out from the crowded field of YA sci-fi adventures\".[41] Metacritic gives the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[42] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of A− on an A+ to F scale.[43] According to Tim Ryan of The Wall Street Journal, critics considered the film better than most young adult book-to-film adaptations due to its \"strong performances and a creepy, mysterious atmosphere\".[44]\n\nRafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film a three out of four and described it as \"solid, well crafted and entertaining\".[45] Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com said she found the film intriguing, writing that \"it tells us a story we think we've heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail\".[46] The Seattle Times's Soren Anderson said the film was \"vastly superior to the book that inspired it\" and gave it a score of 3/4.[47] Tony Hicks of the San Jose Mercury News was \"hooked by the combination of fine acting, intriguing premise and riveting scenery\".[48] Matthew Toomey of ABC Radio Brisbane gave the film a grade of A−, giving praise to its intriguing premise saying that \"it held [his] attention for its full two hour running time\".[49] Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter said it was \"consistently engaging\",[50] and Ella Taylor of Variety wrote \"as world-creation YA pictures go, The Maze Runner feels refreshingly low-tech and properly story-driven\".[51]\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post said \"The Maze Runner unravels a few mysteries, but it spins even more\", giving it a 3/4.[52] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger wrote \"it does leave you wanting to see the next installment. And that's one special effect that very few YA movies ever pull off\".[53] Isaac Feldberg of We Got This Covered awarded the film 8/10 stars, calling it \"dark, dangerous and uncommonly thrilling\", while extolling it as \"one of the most engaging YA adaptations to hit theaters in quite some time.\"[54] Rick Bentley of The Fresno Bee praised Wes Ball's direction, saying that he \"created balance between a thin but solid script and first-rate action – and he doesn't waste a frame doing it\".[55] Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times called it \"a well-acted and intelligent thriller/futuristic sci-fi romp\".[56] Bilge Ebiri of New York magazine said he \"was quite riveted\".[57] Michael Sragow of the Orange County Register gave it a grade of B and said, \"Ball is deft, though, at evoking claustrophobia of every kind, whether in the open-air prison of the Glade or the actual tight spaces of the Maze. And he elicits a hair-trigger performance from O'Brien\".[58]\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today said \"a sci-fi thriller set in a vaguely post-apocalyptic future must create a fully drawn universe to thoroughly captivate the viewer. But Maze Runner feels only partially formed\", giving it a score of 2/4.[59] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said \"like Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit-tentialism, but more crowded and with the musk of bottled-up testosterone\".[60] Wesley Morris of the website Grantland said \"I think I have a touch of apocalepsy – excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three- and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors\".[61] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film a 2.5 out of 4 rating and said \"it's bleak business, and as it hurries toward its explosive, expository conclusion, the film becomes nonsensical, too\".[62] Film critic Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe said \"teens should eat up this fantasy's scenery-chewing angst and doom, and the hopeful tale of survival and empowerment (to be continued in the inevitable sequel or sequels)\".[63]\n\n### Accolades\n\n|   Year  | Award                               | Category                                                  | Nominee(s)                               | Result    |\n|---------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|   2014  | IFMCA Awards[64]                    | Best Original Score for an Action/Adventure/Thriller Film | John Paesano                             | Nominated |\n|   2015  | MTV Movie Awards[65]                | Best Breakthrough Performance                             | Dylan O'Brien                            | Won       |\n|   2015  | MTV Movie Awards[65]                | Best Fight                                                | Dylan O'Brien and Will Poulter           | Won       |\n|   2015  | MTV Movie Awards[65]                | Best Hero                                                 | Dylan O'Brien                            | Won       |\n|   2015  | MTV Movie Awards[65]                | Best Scared-As-Shit Performance                           | Dylan O'Brien                            | Nominated |\n|   2015  | Teen Choice Awards[66]              | Choice Movie: Action/Adventure                            | The Maze Runner                          | Nominated |\n|   2015  | Teen Choice Awards[66]              | Choice Movie: Breakout Star                               | Thomas Brodie-Sangster                   | Nominated |\n|   2015  | Teen Choice Awards[66]              | Choice Movie: Chemistry                                   | Dylan O'Brien and Thomas Brodie-Sangster | Nominated |\n|   2015  | Teen Choice Awards[66]              | Choice Movie Actor: Action/Adventure                      | Dylan O'Brien                            | Nominated |\n|   2015  | Teen Choice Awards[66]              | Choice Movie Actress: Action/Adventure                    | Kaya Scodelario                          | Nominated |\n|   2015  | World Soundtrack Awards[67]         | Public Choice Award                                       | John Paesano                             | Won       |\n|   2016  | Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards[68] | Favorite Book                                             | James Dashner                            | Nominated |\n\n## Sequels\n\nOn October 11, 2013, it was reported that Twentieth Century Fox had acquired the rights to the second book, The Scorch Trials. A screenplay was written by T. S. Nowlin, with director Wes Ball supervising the scriptwriting.[69] The sequel was released on September 18, 2015.[70][71] On July 25, 2014, Ball announced at San Diego Comic-Con that filming for the sequel would commence sometime between March and May 2015, should The Maze Runner become a success when it hits the theaters.[72] However, two weeks prior to the film's release 20th Century Fox decided to move ahead with the sequel and pre-production began in early September 2014 in New Mexico.[73] Cast members Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Ki-Hong Lee, and Patricia Clarkson reprised their roles for the sequel, as did director Wes Ball. It was announced that Aidan Gillen would be joining the film to play Janson (\"Rat-Man\"),[74] as was Rosa Salazar who portrayed Brenda,[75] Jacob Lofland who starred as Aris Jones,[76] and Giancarlo Esposito who played Jorge Gallaraga.[77]\n\nA second sequel, Maze Runner: The Death Cure was released on January 26, 2018.\n\n## In pop culture\n\nOn February 27, 2020, South Korean boy band BTS released their music video \"On\", which referenced set pieces from The Maze Runner. The homage was noted by source book author Dashner on Twitter.[78]\n\nAnson Lo said the opening of his 2022 song \"King Kong\" music video paid tribute to The Maze Runner. He is the director of the music video.[79]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"The Maze Runner (2014)\". Box Office Mojo. September 19, 2014. Archived from the original on July 26, 2019.

The \"Gladers\" have formed a rudimentary society, each taking on specialized roles. The boy learns that a vast maze encircles the Glade and is their only means of escape. During the day, designated \"Runners\" search the maze for an exit and return before its gate closes at sunset. After a fight with Gally, the boy remembers his name is Thomas.</text>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <title>Production</title>\n            <text>Development of The Maze Runner began in January 2011 when Fox purchased the film rights to Dashner's novel with Gotham Group, Temple Hill Entertainment, TSG Entertainment as producers and Catherine Hardwicke intended to direct.

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence, in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\nCameron devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to Conan the Destroyer (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Aliens (1986). The film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.\n\nDefying low pre-release expectations, The Terminator topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, The Terminator was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n## Plot\n\nA cyborg assassin dubbed \"The Terminator\" is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 Los Angeles. It resembles a human male and is programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named Sarah Connor. Separately, a human soldier named Kyle Reese simultaneously arrives, intent on stopping the Terminator. After searching for addresses in a telephone directory, the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly-named women, as well as several other people it comes in close contact with, including Sarah's roommate, Ginger, and her boyfriend, Matt. The Terminator eventually locates the actual Sarah at a local nightclub, where she is rescued by Reese during a mass shooting. The pair then hijack a car to escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.\n\nAs they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet, created by Cyberdyne Systems, will soon become self-aware and trigger a global nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction. Sarah's future son, John, will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to assassinate Sarah, thereby preventing John's birth. Reese additionally divulges that the Terminator has a perfect voice-mimicking ability and a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue to appear human.\n\nThe Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah, but it disappears after crashing during a car chase with the duo. The police apprehend Reese and Sarah. Sarah is notified of Ginger and Matt's murder, while Reese is interrogated by Dr. Silberman, a skeptical criminal psychologist. The Terminator breaks into a hotel room to perform self-repairs on its damaged eye and right arm, then arrives at the police station searching for Sarah, slaughtering many officers in the process. Reese and Sarah run off, hijack another car and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in John's photograph and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have sex, conceiving John.\n\nThe Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah. Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into the truck's hose tube, causing the truck to explode and reduce the Terminator to its endoskeleton. It pursues them into a Cyberdyne-owned factory, where Reese activates machinery to distract it, but it eventually discovers them. Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection to blow it apart, but at the cost of his life. Its still-functional torso then pursues Sarah, but she manages to lure it into a hydraulic press that she uses to destroy it.\n\nMonths later, Sarah, visibly pregnant with John, travels through Mexico, recording audio tapes to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a polaroid photograph of her, the exact one that John will one day give to Reese, and she purchases it. The gas station owner remarks that a storm is coming and she notifies her awareness, alluding to humanity's impending conflict against Skynet, before driving away towards it.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n,  and  (pictured in 1984, 1997 and 2008, respectively) played the film's eponymous character and leads.\n\n- Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator, a cybernetic android disguised as a human male that is sent back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor.\n- Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, a member of the resistance against Skynet sent back in time to protect Sarah.\n- Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, a young diner waitress and the Terminator's target, who is soon to be the mother of the future leader of the resistance, John.\n- Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler, a police lieutenant who tries to protect Sarah.\n- Lance Henriksen as Hal Vukovich, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n- Bess Motta as Ginger, Sarah's roommate whom the Terminator murders after mistaking her for Sarah.\n- Rick Rossovich as Matt, Ginger's boyfriend whom the Terminator also dispatches.\n- Earl Boen as Doctor Peter Silberman, a criminal psychologist.\n\nAdditional actors included Shawn Schepps as Nancy, Sarah's co-worker at the diner; Dick Miller as a gun shop clerk; professional bodybuilder Franco Columbu as a Terminator in the future; Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punks whom the Terminator confronts and dispatches; Marianne Muellerleile as one of the other women with the name \"Sarah Connor\" whom the Terminator dispatches; Rick Aiello as the bouncer of the local nightclub where the Terminator finally locates Sarah; and Bill Wisher as a police officer who reports a hit-and-run felony on Reese, only to be knocked unconscious and have his car stolen by the Terminator soon thereafter.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nIn Rome, Italy, during the release of Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), director James Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.[6] Inspired by director John Carpenter, who had made the slasher film Halloween (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a \"launching pad\" to write a slasher-style film.[7] Cameron's agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.[8]\n\nCameron returned to Pomona, California, and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for The Terminator.[9] Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series The Outer Limits, and contemporary films such as The Driver (1978) and Mad Max 2 (1981).[10][11] To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by phoning each other and recording phone calls of them reading new scenes.[8]\n\nThe initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry.[12] Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid Terminator,[12][13] and shelved the idea until the appearance of the T-1000 character in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).[14]\n\nGale Anne Hurd bought the rights to The Terminator from James Cameron for one dollar.[15]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman's assistant, showed interest in the project.[8] Cameron sold the rights for The Terminator to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron stated that she \"did no actual writing at all\".[15][16] Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar.[17] Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures. Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation.[18] Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.[19]\n\nCameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.[18] Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked open the door to the office and then sat in a chair.[18] Cameron arrived shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film.[18] In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion.[18][20] The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million.[21] Aside from Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film Funding and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.[4][3][22]\n\n### Casting\n\nFor the role of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator.[20] Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even more famous to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson both turned down the Terminator role.[23] Medavoy suggested O. J. Simpson but Cameron did not feel that Simpson, at that time, would be believable as a killer.[24][25][26][27]\n\nCameron agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role.[28] Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger, who would talk about how the villain should be played, and began sketching his face on a notepad, asking Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still.[25][29] After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that \"he'd make a hell of a Terminator\".[30]\n\nCasting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator [...] shouldn't have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely.[31]\n\nSchwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of Conan the Destroyer, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had, which belonged to the wardrobe for The Terminator. Schwarzenegger responded, \"Oh, some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.\"[32] He recounted in his memoir, Total Recall, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from Conan the Barbarian and that the film was low-profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. In a later interview with GQ, he admitted that he and the studio regarded it as just another B action movie, since \"The year before came out Exterminator, now it was the Terminator and what else is gonna be next, type of thing\". It was only when he saw 20 minutes of the first edit did he realize that \"this is really intense, this is wild, I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before\" and realized that \"this could be bigger than we all think\".[33] To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.[30] Schwarzenegger speaks only 17 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. Cameron said that \"Somehow, even his accent worked ... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out.\"[34]\n\nVarious other actors were suggested for the role of Reese, including rock musician Sting.[35] Cameron met with Sting, but he was not interested as Cameron was too much an unknown director at the time.[36] Others who were considered for Reese, included Christopher Reeve, Matt Dillon, Kurt Russell, Treat Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, Scott Glenn, Michael O'Keefe, and Bruce Springsteen.[37] Cameron chose Michael Biehn. Biehn, who had recently seen Taxi Driver and had aspirations about acting alongside the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Robert Redford, was originally skeptical, feeling the film was silly.[38] After meeting with Cameron, Biehn changed his mind.[35] Hurd stated that \"almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.\"[39] To get into Reese's character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.[40]\n\nIn the first pages of the script, Sarah Connor is described as \"19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.\"[41] Lisa Langlois was offered the role but turned it down as she was already shooting The Slugger's Wife.[42] Jennifer Jason Leigh, Melissa Sue Anderson, and Jessica Harper were also considered for the role of Sarah Connor.[37] Cameron cast Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming Children of the Corn.[43] Rosanna Arquette and Lea Thompson also auditioned for the role.[44][45] Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film.[46] For the special effects shots, Cameron wanted Dick Smith, who had worked on The Godfather and Taxi Driver. Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston.[47]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for The Terminator was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming Conan the Destroyer. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for Rambo: First Blood Part II, refined the Terminator script, and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to Alien, which became Aliens, released in 1986.[46][48]\n\nThere was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted.[49] To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome.[47][50] Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproductions of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.[50]\n\nThe sequences set in 2029 and the stop-motion scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr.[51] A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's endoskeleton. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.[52]\n\nOne of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; because of the high power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.[53]\n\nIn March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.[50][54] Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that \"the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\"[55] Most of The Terminator's action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.[56]\n\nSchwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line \"I'll be back\" changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the word I'll. Cameron refused to change the line to \"I will be back\", so Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career.[57]\n\nAfter production finished on The Terminator, some post-production shots were needed.[58] These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.[24][54][58] The final scene where Sarah is driving down a highway was filmed without a permit. Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who confronted them that they were making a UCLA student film.[59]\n\n### Music\n\nThe Terminator soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel.[60] Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working on The Terminator and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music.[61] Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd.[61] Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had only worked in television, not theatrical films.[61] Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that \"You know, I'm going to play this for him because it's really dark and I think it's interesting for him.\" The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.[61]\n\nFiedel said his score reflected \"a mechanical man and his heartbeat\".[62] Almost all the music was performed live.[8][62] The Terminator theme is used in the opening credits and appears in various points, such as a slowed version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.[63] It has been described as \"haunting\", with a \"deceptively simple\" melody[64] recorded on a Prophet-10 synthesizer.[65] It is in the unusual time signature of 13\n16, which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and accidentally created an incomplete loop on his sequencer; Fiedel liked the \"herky-jerky\" \"propulsiveness\".[65] Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a \"heroic moment\". Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.[62]\n\n## Release\n\nSchwarzenegger with President Ronald Reagan two months before The Terminator's premiere in 1984\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrion Pictures did not have faith in The Terminator performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception.[66] At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics.[24] Orion only held one press screening for the film.[66] The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.[67][68] Cameron noted that The Terminator was a hit \"relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.\"[69] The Terminator grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.[5]\n\n## Critical response\n\n### Contemporary\n\nContemporary critical responses to The Terminator were mixed.[70] Variety praised the film, calling it a \"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story ... Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog.\"[71] Richard Corliss of Time magazine said that the film had \"plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.\"[72] Time placed The Terminator on its \"10 Best\" list for 1984.[66]\n\nThe Los Angeles Times called the film \"a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats ... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.\"[66] The Milwaukee Journal gave the film three stars, calling it \"the most chilling science fiction thriller since Alien\".[73] A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story ... It's like a streamlined Dirty Harry movie – no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.\"[74] In the May 1985 issue of Cinefantastique it was referred to as a film that \"manages to be both derivative and original at the same time ... not since The Road Warrior has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage\" and \"an example of science fiction/horror at its best ... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity\".[75] In the United Kingdom the Monthly Film Bulletin praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.[75][76] Colin Greenland reviewed The Terminator for Imagine magazine, and stated that it was \"a gripping sf horror movie\". He continued, \"Linda Hamilton is admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg.\"[77]\n\nOther reviews criticized the film's violence and story-telling quality. Janet Maslin of The New York Times opined that the film was a \"B-movie with flair. Much of it ... has suspense and personality, and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull. There is far too much of the latter, in the form of car chases, messy shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger's slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way.\"[78] The Pittsburgh Press wrote a negative review, calling the film \"just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like Streets of Fire and Blade Runner\".[79] The Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars, adding that \"at times it's horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style actually helps, providing a little humor just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey.\"[80] The Newhouse News Service called the film a \"lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap\".[81] Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film \"repellent to the last degree\", charging it with \"insidious Nazification\" and having an \"appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism, fashion and fascination\".[82]\n\nAudience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[83]\n\n### Retrospective\n\nIn 1991, Richard Schickel of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film, giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film\". He called it \"one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made.\"[84] In 1998, Halliwell's Film Guide described The Terminator as \"slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures\".[85] Film4 gave it five stars, calling it the \"sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.\"[86] TV Guide gave the film four stars, referring to it as an \"amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget ... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.\"[87] Empire gave it five stars, calling it \"as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets\".[88] The film database AllMovie gave it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, saying that it \"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.\"[89] Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for Radio Times, writing that \"maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.\"[90] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five stars out of five, stating that \"on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg. Sadly, it spawned a string of pointless and inferior sequels, but the first Terminator [...] stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement.\"[91]\n\n## Post-release\n\n### Plagiarism and aftermath\n\nWriter Harlan Ellison stated that he \"loved the movie, was just blown away by it,\"[92] but believed that the screenplay was based on a short story and episode of The Outer Limits he had written, \"Soldier\", and threatened to sue for infringement.[93][94] Orion settled in 1986 and gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film.[93] The credit was also present on the 4k restoration that received a cinematic release and was released on Blu-ray in 2024 for the film's 40th anniversary.[95][better source needed] Some accounts of the settlement state that \"Demon with a Glass Hand\", another Outer Limits episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film,[96][97][98][99] but Ellison explicitly stated that The Terminator \"was a ripoff\" of \"Soldier\" rather than of \"Demon with a Glass Hand.\"[93]\n\nCameron was against Orion's decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he \"had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course, there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.\"[100]\n\n### Thematic analysis\n\nThe psychoanalyst Darian Leader sees The Terminator as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity; he writes:\n\nWe are shown time and again that to be a man requires more than to have the biological body of a male: something else must be added to it... To be a man means to have a body plus something symbolic, something which is not ultimately human. Hence the frequent motif of the man machine, from the Six Million Dollar Man to the Terminator or Robocop.[101]\n\nThe Terminator also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance and rebellion. The robots become self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed. The impact of this theme is so great that the Terminator robot has become the \"prevalent visual representation of AI risk\".[102]\n\n#### Genre\n\nThe Terminator features a narrative where elements of the science fiction film and action film genres prevail.\nWhile rarely considered a horror film, the film does feature iconography associated with the slasher film, such as The Terminator as an unstoppable villain, and Sarah Connor as a final girl archetype.[103]\n\nAuthors Paul Meehan in his book Tech-Noir: The Fusion of Science Fiction and Film Noir (2008) and Emily E. Auger in Tech-Noir Film: A Theory of the Development of Popular Genres (2011) found that The Terminator belonged to and was the originator of the term tech-noir. Both authors applied the term as a film genre to several works from the 1980s to the 2000s.[104][105] Academic Carl Freedman was critical of Meehan's categorization, noting Meehan's lack of interest in genre theory and that his handling of generic categories of science fiction and film noir were not clear.[106] Paweł Frelik also critiqued Auger's lack of knowledge in genre theory, and dismissed the notion of tech-noir being a unique film genre. Frelik wrote that the films Auger mentioned including The Terminator and Blade Runner (1982) had no applicable reason to be understood as tech-noir rather than science fiction.[105]\n\n### Home media\n\nMichael Biehn signing a copy of the film during an appearance at Midtown Comics in 2012\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Terminator was released on VHS and Betamax in 1985.[107] The film performed well financially on its initial release. The Terminator premiered at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video cassette sales charts. In its second week, The Terminator reached number 4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette sales charts.[108][109]\nIn March 1995, The Terminator was released as a letterboxed edition on Laserdisc.[110] The film premiered through Image Entertainment on DVD, on September 3, 1997.[67][111] IGN referred to this DVD as \"pretty bare-bones ... released with just a mono soundtrack and a kind of poor transfer.\"[112]\n\nThrough their acquisition of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's pre-1996 film library catalogue, MGM Home Entertainment released a special edition of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the script, and advertisements for the film.[113][112] On January 23, 2001, a Hong Kong VCD edition was released online.[114] On June 20, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in the United States, becoming the first film from the 1980s on the format.[115] In 2013, the film was re-released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, with a new digitally remastered transfer from a 4K restoration by Lowry Digital and supervised by James Cameron,[116] which features improved picture quality, as well as minimal special features, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature. These are the exact same special features that have been carried over from previous Blu-ray releases.[citation needed] The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment in November 5, 2024.[117]\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Terminator has an approval rating of 100% based on 67 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.8/10. Its critical consensus reads: \"With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why The Terminator continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.\"[118] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned The Terminator a score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[119]\n\nThe Terminator won three Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Make-up and Best Writing.[120] The film has also received recognition from the American Film Institute, ranked 42nd on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills, a list of America's most heart-pounding films.[121] The character of the Terminator was selected as the 22nd-greatest movie villain on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains.[122] Schwarzenegger's line \"I'll be back\" became a catchphrase and was voted the 37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.[123]\n\nIn 2005, Total Film named it the 72nd-best film ever made.[124] Schwarzenegger's biographer Laurence Leamer wrote that The Terminator is \"an influential film affecting a whole generation of darkly hued science fiction, and it was one of Arnold's best performances\".[125] In 2008, Empire magazine selected The Terminator as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[126] Empire also placed the T-800 14th on their list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[127] In 2008, The Terminator was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.[128] In 2010, the Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[129] In 2015, The Terminator was among the films included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.[130]\n\nIn 2019, Huw Fullerton of Radio Times ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating \"The Terminator was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in 1984, and no matter how badly the visual effects age it hasn't lost its impact.\"[131] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of /Film ranked it the fourth best film of Cameron's career, stating, \"While its pacing and story structure isn't as tight as its sequel's, The Terminator remains one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture ever created.\"[132] Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number seven in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\", stating, \"Cameron forever changed both the genre and Schwarzenegger's career with The Terminator, an iconic, tension-filled flick that mixes science fiction, action, and certain horror movie elements into one of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood [...] Cameron's well-structured script is pure polish, with zero fat and a surplus of riveting tension that helps make it the timeless classic it is today.\"[133]\n\n### Merchandise\n\nA soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and rock songs used in the club scenes.[134] Shaun Hutson wrote a novelization of the film which was published on February 21, 1985, by London-based Star Books (ISBN 0-352-31645-4);[135] Randal Frakes and William Wisher wrote a different novelization for Bantam/Spectra, published October, 1985 (ISBN 0-553-25317-4).

It resembles a human male and is programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named Sarah Connor. Separately, a human soldier named Kyle Reese simultaneously arrives, intent on stopping the Terminator. After searching for addresses in a telephone directory, the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly-named women, as well as several other people it comes in close contact with, including Sarah's roommate, Ginger, and her boyfriend, Matt. The Terminator eventually locates the actual Sarah at a local nightclub, where she is rescued by Reese during a mass shooting. The pair then hijack a car to escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator</Actor>\n        <Actor>Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese</Actor>\n        <Actor>Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor</Actor>\n        <Actor>Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler</Actor>\n        <Actor>Lance Henriksen as Hal Vukovich</Actor>\n        <Actor>Bess Motta as Ginger</Actor>\n        <Actor>Rick Rossovich as Matt</Actor>\n        <Actor>Earl Boen as Doctor Peter Silberman</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    \n    <Production>\n        <Development>\n            In Rome, Italy, during the release of Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), director James Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion. Inspired by director John Carpenter, Cameron used the dream as a \"launching pad\" to write a slasher-style film. Cameron's agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.\n        </Development>\n        <Filming>\n            Filming for The Terminator was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming Conan the Destroyer. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for Rambo: First Blood Part II, refined the Terminator script, and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to Alien, which became Aliens, released in 1986.\n        </Filming>\n    </Production>\n    \n    <Release>\n        The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to Oh, God! You Devil.\n    </Release>\n    \n    <CriticalResponse>\n        <Contemporary>\n            Contemporary critical responses to The Terminator were mixed. Variety praised the film, calling it a \"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story.\"\n        </Contemporary>\n        <Retrospective>\n            In 1991, Richard Schickel of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the film, giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film.\"\n        </Retrospective>\n    </CriticalResponse>\n    \n    <Legacy>\n        The Terminator has an approval rating of 100% based on 67 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.8/10. Its critical consensus reads: \"With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why The Terminator continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.\"\n    </Legacy>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\n### Summary\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information about \"The Terminator\" according to the specified attributes in the ADT.

It was directed by Jonathan Mostow and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. In its plot, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a T-X (Loken)—a highly advanced Terminator—back in time to ensure the rise of machines by killing top members of the future human resistance as John Connor's (Stahl) location is unknown. The resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-850 (Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate (Danes).\n\nWhile Terminator creator James Cameron was interested in directing the third film, he ultimately had no involvement with Terminator 3. Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar, who had produced Terminator 2: Judgment Day through their company Carolco Pictures, obtained the rights for the franchise through both Carolco's liquidation auction and negotiations with producer Gale Ann Hurd. In 1999, Tedi Sarafian was hired to write the first draft of the script. Mostow joined the project as director in 2001, and he brought on John Brancato and Michael Ferris to rewrite Sarafian's script. The $187 million budget included a $5 million salary for Mostow and a record $30 million salary for Schwarzenegger. Filming took place in California from April to September 2002. Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Stan Winston created the special effects, as they did for the previous film.\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines premiered at the Mann Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles, on June 30, 2003, and was released on July 2, 2003, by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America. The film was rolled out overseas throughout the summer, with Columbia Pictures overseeing the bulk of the international distribution. It received generally positive reviews and earned $433.4 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2003. Coincidentally, the film was used to mark Schwarzenegger's formal entry into politics, having been speculated to be a vehicle for his 2003 gubernatorial run. A sequel, Terminator Salvation, was released in 2009.\n\n## Plot\n\nTen years after destroying Cyberdyne Systems,[b] John Connor has been living as a nomad following the death of his mother, Sarah Connor, and fears that the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet is still hunting him despite a war between humans and machines not happening in 1997, as foretold.\n\nUnable to locate John in the past, Skynet sends the T-X, an advanced prototype Terminator with shapeshifting liquid metal covering a virtually impervious metal endoskeleton, back in time to John's present in Los Angeles, to kill his future allies in the resistance, including John's future wife, Kate Brewster. The resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-850 Terminator to protect John and Kate.\n\nAfter killing other targets, the T-X locates the pair at an animal hospital where Kate works. John becomes the T-X's primary target, but the Terminator helps him and Kate escape, taking them to a mausoleum where John's mother, Sarah, is supposedly interred. Inside her coffin, they find a weapons cache left at Sarah's request in case Judgment Day was not averted and the Terminators returned. They escape an armed battle with the police and fend off the pursuing T-X.\n\nThe Terminator reveals that John and Sarah's actions only delayed Judgment Day and that Skynet's attack will occur that day; the Terminator intends to drive John and Kate to Mexico to escape the fallout when Skynet begins its nuclear attack. John orders the Terminator to take Kate and him to see her father, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Robert Brewster. The Terminator refuses; however, when Kate demands to see her father, the Terminator obeys. It is revealed that the Terminator killed John in the future, after which Kate captured and reprogrammed the Terminator and sent it back in time.\n\nMeanwhile, General Brewster is supervising the development of Skynet for Cyber Research Systems (CRS), which also develops autonomous weapons. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff[c] pressures him to activate Skynet to stop an anomalous computer virus from invading servers worldwide. General Brewster fails to discover that the virus was Skynet becoming sentient, and John and Kate arrive too late to stop him from activating it. The T-X fatally injures General Brewster and controls the CRS weaponized T-1 and HK drones, which kill the employees. Before he dies, the general gives Kate and John the location of what John believes is Skynet's system core. The pair head for the tarmac to take General Brewster's single-engine plane to Crystal Peak, a facility built inside the Sierra Nevada.\n\nAfter a battle, the T-X severely damages the Terminator, reprogramming it to kill John, and pursues John and Kate through the CRS facility. When a particle accelerator is activated, it magnetically binds the T-X to the equipment. The still-conscious Terminator struggles to control its outer functions. As it prepares to kill John, he urges the Terminator to choose between its conflicting programming; it deliberately forces a shutdown of its corrupted system, enabling the pair's escape. Shortly after they leave, the Terminator's system reboots. Meanwhile, the T-X escapes the accelerator and resumes pursuit.\n\nAfter John and Kate reach Crystal Peak, the T-X arrives by helicopter. Before it can attack, the Terminator arrives in a second helicopter, crashing into and crushing the T-X. The T-X pulls itself from the wreckage and attempts to drag itself inside the bunker to follow the pair. The Terminator holds the bunker door open long enough for the pair to lock them inside, then uses its last hydrogen fuel cell to destroy both itself and the T-X.\n\nJohn and Kate discover that Crystal Peak is not Skynet's core but rather a nuclear fallout shelter command facility for government and military officials. Having no core, Skynet has become a part of cyberspace after becoming self-aware. Judgment Day begins as Skynet fires nuclear missiles worldwide, starting a nuclear holocaust. The pair begin receiving radio transmissions on the emergency radio equipment; John tentatively assumes command by answering radio calls, and they realize, as John states, that the intent all along had not been to prevent Judgment Day, only to survive it.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.\n- Nick Stahl as John Connor. Stahl replaces Edward Furlong from the second film.\n- Kristanna Loken as the T-X, an advanced Terminator sent back to murder John's resistance lieutenants\n- Claire Danes as Kate Brewster, John's former classmate and Scott's fiancé.\n- David Andrews as Lieutenant General Robert Brewster, Kate's father who is also the program director at CRS, which has acquired Cyberdyne Systems' remaining assets\n- Mark Famiglietti as Scott Mason, Kate's fiancé who is killed by the T-X. The character was originally named Scott Peterson, but the name was changed in order to avoid association with the case involving the murder of Laci Peterson and her unborn son Conner by her husband Scott Peterson.[6] In the ending credits his name is still listed as \"Scott Petersen\".\n- Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman: Reprising his role from the first two films, Boen appears in one scene, attempting to comfort Kate after she witnesses the acts of the Terminator.\n\nJay Acovone portrayed an LAPD Officer. Kim Robillard and Mark Hicks portrayed Detective Edwards and Detective Bell. In the film's dialogue Bell is identified correctly, however in the film's end credits his name is listed as \"Detective Martinez\". One of Schwarzenegger's stunt doubles, Billy D. Lucas, portrayed a civilian who has his car accidentally wrecked by John.\n\n## Production\n\n### Conception\n\nJames Cameron (pictured in 2000) directed the first two films, but declined to return for the third.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJames Cameron had directed and co-written the previous Terminator films. The film rights to the franchise were held by Carolco Pictures and by Cameron's ex-wife and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, who both held 50 percent of the rights.[7] Cameron had sold his stake to Hurd for $1 prior to directing The Terminator (1984).[8] In July 1991, Cameron said that if Terminator 2 was successful, \"there may be some economic pressure\" to do a sequel.[9] Hurd said that month, \"I've always felt the story lent itself wonderfully to being a continuing tale.\" She believed it was natural that a third film would happen, but was unsure at that time if Arnold Schwarzenegger would reprise his role as the Terminator. Hurd said that for Schwarzenegger to commit to another film, he would have to read a finished script, approve a director, and see if the project fit into his schedule.[10]\n\nFollowing Terminator 2's release, Cameron said he had no intentions for further sequels, believing it \"brings the story full circle and ends. And I think ending it at this point is a good idea\". Cameron and co-writer William Wisher wrote the script with the intention of leaving no option for a sequel.[11][12] Even so, Carolco co-founder Mario Kassar said in May 1992 that he intended to make a Terminator 3 film within the next five to seven years.[13] TriStar Pictures, which distributed Terminator 2, would be involved in the new film. That month, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy said the film would probably take a couple of years.[14]\n\n### Development\n\nBy the end of 1995, Carolco had filed for bankruptcy,[15] and Cameron wanted to direct a third film with the involvement of 20th Century Fox.[16] Cameron's 3D film ride, Terminator 2 3-D: Battle Across Time, would open later in 1996. The project reunited the main cast of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and had prompted Cameron to begin writing a script for a Terminator 3 film.[17] Cameron said Terminator 2 3D: Battle Across Time would serve as a \"stepping stone\" toward a third Terminator film.[18] However, such a film would not be ready for a few years as Cameron was busy working on Titanic for Fox.[17]\n\nWhen Carolco filed for bankruptcy on November 10, 1995, its assets were bound to a liquidation auction.[15][19] That day, Fox signed a $50 million deal to acquire all of Carolco's assets, including the rights to Terminator sequels, as well as the company's existing film library.[15][20] Fox withdrew its bid in January 1996, when Canal Plus bid $58 million for Carolco's film library. Canal Plus' offer did not include purchasing the rights for Carolco sequel films, but Fox wanted all of Carolco's assets and was unwilling to match or exceed the bid offer made by Canal Plus.[20][19] The sequel rights would ultimately be auctioned through U.S. bankruptcy court, where Fox intended to purchase them.[20][21]\n\nThe new Terminator film would have Schwarzenegger reprising his role.[22] Linda Hamilton had also talked with Cameron about reprising her role as Sarah Connor.[23] During 1997, Fox spent nine months negotiating with Cameron, Schwarzenegger, and Hurd, the latter in regard to her share of the sequel rights.[22] Bill Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, oversaw the project and negotiations at that time. Mechanic wanted the trio to be involved in the new film, so he sought to first secure deals with them before proceeding with a purchase of the Carolco rights. Mechanic also believed that a deal with the trio would give him necessary leverage with the U.S. bankruptcy court to acquire the rights from Carolco.[20] At that time, Cameron committed to writing and producing the film, and reserved the right to direct it in the event that he wanted to do so.[8]\n\nFox intended to make the new Terminator film on a budget similar to its predecessor, approximately $95 million. However, it was determined that the film could not be made on the intended budget when considering the additional cost of purchasing Carolco's rights,[22] as well as Schwarzenegger's desired $25 million salary.[24] At some point, Schwarzenegger had talked to Cameron about the two of them buying the rights themselves, but Cameron was not interested in this idea and wanted to let Fox handle the rights. Schwarzenegger said about Fox, \"Only later did I learn they were making these ridiculous lowball offers, like $750,000. We could have owned this ourselves, but Jim didn't want to be in that business.\"[5]\n\nAndrew Vajna in 2013\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDimension Films, a division of Miramax Films, had agreed to purchase the rights that were owned by Hurd and also intended to buy Carolco's rights through the auction. However, a judge ruled against an earlier motion which stated that only an established studio should be allowed to bid for the Carolco rights. This allowed Andrew G. Vajna to participate in the bidding.[5] Vajna had co-founded Carolco with Kassar but left the company in 1989.[20]\n\nIn September 1997, Cameron invited his friends Vajna and Kassar to see an early edit of Titanic, during which Vajna and Kassar learned that the Terminator rights were still available.[8] That month, Mechanic discovered that Vajna had been quietly negotiating with the bankruptcy court to acquire the rights for himself and Kassar; the duo planned to form a new production company with Terminator 3 as its debut. During September 1997, Vajna signed a tentative $7.5 million agreement to purchase the rights, which were to be sold later in an auction scheduled for the following month. Mechanic was upset to learn of Vajna's agreement, having spent months in negotiations with Schwarzenegger, Cameron, and Hurd.[20][21][25] Cameron was upset as well, as Vajna and Kassar had not mentioned their intention to buy the rights during their meeting days earlier. This would lead to the deterioration of their friendship.[8] Vajna later said he was unaware that Cameron was already planning Terminator 3.[26] Miramax dropped out of the bidding when Vajna raised his bid to $8 million.[27]\n\nBy October 1997, the budgetary concerns over Terminator 3 and Cameron's troubled post-production of Titanic for Fox led them both to abandon the Terminator project and not pursue the rights.[22] Mechanic had asked Cameron if he wanted Fox to outbid Vajna, but Cameron decided he did not want to be involved in the project. Mechanic believed that Cameron was \"only hanging in there at the end because of Arnold and quality control. It was something that Arnold always wanted to do again. Period. And Jim was more than happy to do it.\"[8] Cameron gave his approval for Hurd and Schwarzenegger to make another Terminator film without him,[22] although Schwarzenegger did not want to make the film without Cameron,[22][28] and initially refused to star in the third film.[28]\n\nOver time, Schwarzenegger would continue trying to persuade Cameron to be involved in the new film. In 2003, Cameron said that he felt he had already told the whole story with his first two Terminator films, something that he came to realize during the post-production of Titanic.[28] Cameron later stated, \"I just felt as a filmmaker maybe I've gone beyond it. I really wasn't that interested. I felt like I'd told the story I wanted to tell. I suppose I could have pursued it more aggressively and gone to the mat for it but I felt like I was laboring in someone else's house to an extent because I had sold the rights very early on.\"[29] Nevertheless, feeling that the Terminator character was as much Schwarzenegger's as it was his own, Cameron eventually advised Schwarzenegger to do the third film without him, saying, \"If they can come up with a good script and they pay you a lot of money, don't think twice.\"[28] The film was in high demand according to Schwarzenegger, who said he was frequently asked in interviews about the possibility of a third film.[30][28]\n\nIn October 1997, the rights to future Terminator films were auctioned to Vajna for $8 million.[31] Hurd had opposed Vajna's attempt to buy the rights, and had tried unsuccessfully to change Cameron's mind about purchasing the rights.[32] On the night that the rights were auctioned, Vajna contacted Cameron and Schwarzenegger to resolve the situation. Vajna was surprised that Cameron would be upset about the rights being sold, later saying, \"What difference does it make to Jim who's financing the movie, a studio or us? His deal would have been the same. Arnold tried to convince Jim over a long period of time to do the film. Arnold felt very loyal.\"[8] Vajna said that Cameron \"felt that we 'stole his baby', even though we're the ones who put it together last time round. So we felt that that was kind of strange and then we went on to do it ourselves.\"[26]\n\nCameron said in January 1998 that it was unlikely he would direct Terminator 3.[33] In March 1998, Vajna and Kassar acquired Hurd's half of the Terminator rights for $8 million, to become full owners of the franchise, with plans to proceed on Terminator 3.[5][31] Hurd served as an executive producer on the film.[34] Kassar and Vajna contacted Cameron with the hope that he would direct, but he declined.[35][36] According to Kassar, Cameron was trying to obtain the auctioned Terminator rights for himself at the time that he was asked to direct.[35] Cameron and his company, Lightstorm Entertainment, had considered trying to obtain the rights, but ultimately chose not to do so; it was estimated that acquiring the rights and paying Schwarzenegger to reprise his role could cost up to $100 million.[37]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nBy 1999, Kassar and Vajna had been negotiating with various studios about partnering on the project but decided to finalize the film's concept and script first. They founded C2 Pictures that year,[38] and by October 1999,[39] they had brought Toho-Towa and German company VCL on board the project as co-financiers. The latter companies helped finance development of a script by Tedi Sarafian,[36][40] who was hired for the film in 1999, along with David C. Wilson for a possible fourth installment.[38] Fox held discussions with Vajna and Kassar about buying the rights from them for Cameron. Mechanic said these discussions were never serious.[8] It was also reported that Fox and Cameron had been in discussions with Vajna and Kassar about partnering on the film.[36][38] Vajna and Kassar accepted a proposal from Fox, but it fell apart once Toho-Towa and VCL were brought onto the project, as the latter companies purchased the distribution rights for Japan and Germany, the largest markets outside of the United States.[8][36][38] Kassar and Vajna intended to proceed on the film with or without Schwarzenegger, although Kassar preferred that he be involved. Filming was expected to begin in 2000 for a release the following year.[38]\n\nIn March 2000, it was announced that VCL would have a 25 percent stake in the film, as well as the rights in German-speaking territories. At the time, Sarafian was days away from completing his draft, and Kassar hoped to announce a director within 45 days. Filming was still expected to commence later that year, with a release scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2001. Kassar wanted to have Terminator 3 and Terminator 4 shot back to back, possibly with different directors.[41] Plans to shoot the film and its sequel simultaneously were later dropped, in case Terminator 3 did not become a success.[5] Later in 2000, the start of production on Terminator 3 was delayed by a year.[42]\n\nSarafian's script, titled T-3: Rise of the Machines, featured John Connor working in a dot-com company. The script's villain was the T-1G, a female Terminator sent from the future, with the ability to turn invisible.[43][44] By July 2000, Cameron had been given a copy of Sarafian's script, but he passed on directing the film due to his estranged relationship with Vajna and Kassar.[45][46] Cameron later stated that he refused to direct or produce Terminator 3 because he disliked the idea of working from somebody else's script in a story he originated.[47] According to Schwarzenegger, Cameron declined involvement on the project because he did not want to commit to a time frame, as he was busy and had other projects he wanted to explore.[48][49] Other directors being considered in 2000 included Ang Lee, Christian Duguay, David Fincher, John McTiernan, Ridley Scott, and Roland Emmerich.[45][46][5][50] Lee passed on the project to instead direct Hulk (2003).[51] Scott declined to direct the film so that he could begin production on Black Hawk Down.[52] Intermedia was announced as a co-financier in October 2000.[40]\n\nAlthough production was scheduled to begin in 2001, it was delayed in anticipation of a writers strike, which ultimately did not occur.[5][53] There was also the possibility of an actors strike, and filming was scheduled to begin after it ended.[53][54] In March 2001, Jonathan Mostow and his producing partner Hal Lieberman were in negotiations to join the project as director and producer respectively.[54][55] Mostow said he was \"not shy\" when he started working on the project; as he later recalled, \"I said, 'Here's the movie I'm going to make, here's how I'm going to do it. If you don't want to do it my way, you should find a different director.'\"[56] Mostow had concerns about Sarafian's script and declined to start filming until it was perfected.[43][56]\n\nMostow invited his college classmates John Brancato and Michael Ferris to rework the screenplay;[43] they signed on to rewrite it in June 2001.[57] Sarafian still got a story credit,[34] although much of his draft was rewritten, and scenes were added to make it more of a road movie, fulfilling Mostow's vision for the film.[43] Brancato said there was initial consideration given to ignoring the basic format of the earlier films by removing aspects of time travel and killer machines from the future: \"We tried all sorts of wacky scenarios [...] But to be honest it just wasn't working.\"[58] The idea of a female Terminator was retained from Sarafian's draft,[58] although Mostow disliked Sarafian's idea that the character could turn invisible, saying, \"It's not visceral.\" The film makes a subtle reference to Schwarzenegger's age by depicting his character as an obsolete Terminator compared to the T-X. Mostow said, \"It's always great if you can have your protagonist or hero be completely outmatched.\"[43]\n\nIn December 2001, several companies competed for the distribution rights to the film.[59] The heads of each major studio were invited that month to a secret hotel room meeting to read the script and bid for the rights. Fox declined to participate in the meeting, out of loyalty to Cameron.[8] Warner Bros. won the U.S. distribution rights that month, with filming scheduled to begin in April 2002.[60][61] Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International subsequently acquired most of the international distribution rights, including those that would have been handled by VCL, which was suffering financially at the time.[62]\n\nThe film's production budget was initially set at $169–170 million,[63][64] making it the most expensive film ever to be greenlit at the time.[60][61][65] The budget would include paying off the debts of Carolco, as well as a $5 million salary for Mostow and a record $30 million salary for Schwarzenegger.[59][66][67] The distribution rights were sold for $145 million, while the remaining $25 million would be covered by Vajna, Kassar, and Intermedia.[8] Budget statements for the film put the final cost at $187.3 million (or $167.3 million excluding the production overhead).[68][69] Product placement deals, with companies such as PepsiCo and Toyota, helped regenerate profit. For example, the film prominently features the then-new Toyota Tundra truck.[5] Schwarzenegger received a record salary of $29.25 million, plus 20 percent of the profits,[68] although he agreed to defer part of his salary in order to prevent the relocation of the set to Vancouver, British Columbia, from Los Angeles.[70] Initially, the film was to have a 100-day shoot, with 62 days in Vancouver and 38 days in Los Angeles. The cast and crew generally agreed that they did not want to relocate from California, so $8 million was trimmed from the budget, allowing for filming to take place entirely in the state. Another benefit of shooting in Los Angeles is that the film is set there.[71] It was announced in February 2002 that the shoot would take place entirely in California.[72]\n\n### Casting\n\nSchwarzenegger signed on to the project in June 2000,[73][74] after reading Sarafian's draft.[26] Edward Furlong signed on in August 2000, to reprise his role as John Connor from the previous film.[75][44] However, in December 2001, casting began for a new actor to replace Furlong,[76] who was dropped from the project because of a substance abuse problem.[77][78] Furlong was removed by Warner Bros., which was concerned that his publicized drug problems could jeopardize the project.[5] Furlong later stated \"I don't know [what happened]. It just wasn't the time. I was going through my own thing at the point in my life – whatever, it just wasn't meant to be\".[77]\n\nAccording to Mostow, Furlong had been considered, but the director wanted to start from scratch with a new actor, as John would be portrayed as \"a very different character now.\"[79] Mostow described the character as someone who has carried the burden of being a leader in the future, saying \"it's very lonely because nobody else in the world knows about it or believes it. Even if he tried to explain to somebody, they'd think he was crazy and that's a really interesting character.\"[80] Mostow wanted the character to have soulfulness and he believed that Nick Stahl was the right actor for the role.[79] Although John Connor was written as being 10 years old in the script for Terminator 2, Furlong was actually several years older than that. For Terminator 3, Mostow wondered whether the character's current age should be faithful to what was written before. After some consideration, Mostow chose to make the character slightly older for Terminator 3, to be consistent with Furlong's real age. The film states that John was 13 years old during the events of the previous film. Mostow said he tried to avoid the age discrepancy as much as possible in the film.[79] Some fans were disappointed by the decision to recast Furlong,[79] and some were alienated by the age change.[81]\n\nIn November 2000, Linda Hamilton said she had turned down an offer to reprise her role as Sarah Connor.[82] Hamilton said in October 2001 that the script did not take her character in any new directions: \"The film is really about turning the baton over to Sarah's son John, played by Eddie Furlong. It's Eddie's movie - and Arnold's. It was like a no-win situation for me.\" She also was dissuaded by the fact that Cameron would have no involvement in the film.[83][84] Hamilton later explained her decision not to reprise her role: \"They offered me a part. I read it and I knew my character arc was so complete in the first two, and in the third one it was a negligible character. She died halfway through and there was no time to mourn her. It was kind of disposable, so I said no thank you.\"[85] When Mostow signed on as director, one of his conditions was that Hamilton reprise her role.[86][79] However, he realized that the character would not have changed much since the previous film and that she would not contribute much to the story, saying later, \"Linda Hamilton is too important to the franchise to stick her in as the third wheel.\" Mostow realized that John Connor would need to be the focus of the story, although the mausoleum scene was added as a way of integrating Hamilton's character into the story as well.[79] Old footage of Hamilton was expected to be used for flashback scenes of Sarah Connor,[87][88] although no such scenes exist in the final film. Mostow said the flashbacks made \"a complicated story even more complicated.\"[5]\n\nWhen Schwarzenegger was called into Kassar and Vajna's office in April 2001, he did not expect them to bring up Terminator 3 given the film's long stint in development hell. Instead, he wanted to talk to the producers about his political interests, including a potential candidacy as Governor of California in the 2002 election. However, pre-production was rolling along, with the screenplay nearly finished and set deals for both merchandising and distribution. Schwarzenegger postponed his gubernatorial plans, which eventually came into fruition with the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election. Instead, the actor combined production of the film with the promotion of Proposition 49, which advocated increased extracurricular activity in California schools. At times Schwarzenegger even received politicians, journalists, and potential financial backers of the proposition on the film set.[89] During pre-production, Schwarzenegger worked out daily to prepare for the role, to get into the same physical shape in which he was during shooting of the previous films.[90] Schwarzenegger felt it was important to be in the same physical condition as he was for the previous film, saying, \"Otherwise, people would say, 'He's lost it; he's all saggy and flabby,' and that would be all anyone would talk about it. I didn't want to be digitized, because someone would blab, and it would be in all the columns. So I just worked harder.\"[5]\n\nApproximately 10,000 women auditioned for the role of the T-X.[86] Schwarzenegger originally wanted wrestling star Chyna to portray the T-X.[5][91] Famke Janssen subsequently emerged as the most likely candidate for the role.[5][92] Following the 2001 release of The Fast and the Furious, starring Vin Diesel, there was consideration given to rewriting the T-X character as a man with Diesel in the role.[5][93] In early 2002, Kristanna Loken was cast as the T-X, while Stahl was cast as John Connor.[94][95] Stahl auditioned approximately five times, and underwent three screen tests, before receiving the role.[96] Other actors considered for the role of John Connor included Shane West, Jake Gyllenhaal,[97][98] and Logan Marshall-Green.[99] For the film, Stahl took some weapons training and learned how to ride a motorcycle.[90] Stahl did not aim to impersonate Furlong's earlier performance. For her role, Loken underwent six weeks of training,[90] involving weights, fighting, and weapons.[87] She also undertook Krav Maga,[90] and gained 14 pounds (6.4 kg) of muscle.[100] In addition, Loken took a mime movement class to perfect her character's robotic movements.[87]\n\nMostow originally wanted Claire Danes for the role of Kate Brewster, but the initial effort to get her involved did not work out.[86][79] Sophia Bush was cast in the role instead, and Mostow was more excited about her casting than any other character.[79] However, during filming, Mostow felt that Bush's appearance and performance seemed too youthful for the role.[5][101] He said, \"I tried everything I could to make her look older, but ultimately the camera doesn't lie. So I had to replace her and it was heart breaking because it was a huge break for her.\"[79] After reading the script, Danes decided to join the cast to play Kate.[5] Bush was replaced by Danes in May 2002, a month into filming.[101][102] Danes began filming the day after she was hired.[103]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming began on April 15, 2002.[101] The first night of filming involved Schwarzenegger's Terminator ramming a vehicle into Loken's T-X outside the animal hospital,[30] which was constructed as a set in Los Angeles' Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood.[90][104] Initially, Mostow was somewhat hesitant about following Cameron's footsteps as director,[35][66] but he eventually put aside such concerns and later said, \"Everyone will see this movie and make comparisons, but I can't control any of that.\"[66] Schwarzenegger missed working with Cameron and initially did not have the same kind of confidence in Mostow as filming began. However, during the first week of filming, Schwarzenegger became convinced that Mostow was an adequate choice.[35][66]\n\nProduction designer Jeff Mann and his crew of 350 people designed and constructed multiple sets for the film during a four-month period prior to filming.[90] Los Angeles Center Studios was a major filming location,[71] as the production used six sound stages there.[90] At least three sound stages were occupied by the project at all times during filming, and at one point all of the stages were in use for the shoot.[71] In June 2002, driving scenes were filmed at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.[105] Filming also took place at Big Bend National Park in Texas.[106] Some sequences use more than 1,000 simultaneous tracks of audio.[90]\n\nStahl had few scenes during the initial weeks of filming, giving him time to work on his physique.[96] Schwarzenegger worked out during lunch breaks to maintain his physical appearance.[90][107] He had a 20-foot (6.1 m) trailer with a gym inside, where he would work out in between filming.[87][86] Schwarzenegger also performed many of his own stunts, something that he enjoyed doing. One of the most elaborate and choreographed stunts was devised by Mostow and stunt coordinator Simon Crane. The scene involves the T-X driving a 100-ton mobile crane down a street in pursuit of John Connor. During the scene, Schwarzenegger's Terminator hangs on to the crane arm as it is swung around, smashing him into a glass building and a passing fire truck. Fourteen cameras were used for the shot in which he crashes through a glass building, as the film crew would only have one chance to film it, which was the case with many of the film's stunts. Schwarzenegger enjoyed filming the scene and called it \"unbelievable,\" while stating, \"We used every safety precaution, but there were close calls, many times.\" The street chase was filmed on a 0.25-mile (0.40 km) set of road and buildings, constructed at a Boeing plant in Downey, California.[90][108] The film's showdown between the two Terminators is set in a marble and steel bathroom. Mostow's vision for the scene was to have the bathroom completely destroyed by the Terminators by the end of their battle. The scene took four weeks to rehearse and two weeks to film.[90] In early September 2002, scenes were filmed at San Bernardino International Airport.[109]\n\nAs with the previous films, the Terminator characters arrive naked after travelling through time.[90][110] One of the film's opening scenes is set at the Desert Star bar, where Schwarzenegger's Terminator goes in search of clothes. The scene was filmed at the Cowboy Palace bar in the San Fernando Valley.[90] The Sierra Inn bar and restaurant, in Agua Dulce, California, was also used for exterior shots of the Desert Star.[111][112] The final scene to be filmed was another opening scene in which the T-X arrives naked on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California. Mostow said shooting the scene discreetly was a challenge due to the tourist popularity of Rodeo Drive. The filmmakers had to wait five months before finally receiving clearance to shoot the scene.[110] The street had to be closed for filming to take place.[113] The 5-month[90] shoot proceeded as scheduled (From April 15, 2002), and concluded on September 8, 2002.[110][114]\n\n### Effects\n\nThe film features more than 600 special effects shots.[66] Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and Stan Winston created the special effects, as they had done for the previous film.[115][116] Winston created the Terminator special effects and also designed the T-1,[90][117] an early Terminator machine that appears in the CRS facility near the end of the film. Mostow said about the T-1, \"I wanted to depict the first generation of Terminator robots, to show where it all began. […] We came up with this primitive but deadly robotic machine that is part tank, part robot.\" Winston created five full-sized, functioning T-1 robots, each one controlled by hydraulics. Winston's team also designed the T-X's endoskeleton frame, as well as her weapons. Certain sequences involving fire and explosions were deemed too dangerous for Schwarzenegger and Loken to perform, so Winston and his team constructed life-sized robot replicas of the actors for such scenes.[90] When the start of production was delayed from its earlier 2001 date, it allowed Winston more time to develop the various special effects.[5] ILM used miniature sculptures and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create numerous visual effects for brief scenes set in the future, depicting the post-apocalyptic war between humans and machines.[90] ILM's effects included Terminator endoskeletons seen during the future war. The endoskeletons were created entirely through CGI.[118]\n\nOne challenging scene for the visual effects team takes place at a cemetery, where the T-X has taken on the appearance of Kate's fiancé, before morphing to her original appearance. The scene required several repeated shots of the same area with the use of controlled camera movements that were the same for each take.[90] Another difficult scene depicts the T-X's liquid metal exterior peeling off to reveal her endoskeleton. The visual effects team took six months to develop a method that would adequately simulate the scene. Pablo Helman, visual effects supervisor for ILM, said, \"We had no application for creating and controlling streams of liquid metal, so we had to begin by determining the density, weight, shape and mass of this material, and how it would move under these conditions. It was a really complicated process.\"[90] Another scene features the crane vehicle flipping over at the end of the road chase sequence. The production crew determined that it would be too dangerous and impractical to use the actual vehicle during this portion of the sequence, so ILM digitally recreated the crane using photos of the actual vehicle.[90]\n\nOne scene depicts the T-101 cutting open his chest cavity to remove a failing fuel cell battery, while simultaneously driving a truck. For the scene, Winston's team used cyber scans to create a body cast replica of Schwarzenegger that would sit in the driver's seat. Schwarzenegger was situated in the back of the truck, and his head and arms were visible in the front seat to give the impression that he was connected to the body cast.[90] Several shots during the bathroom battle used CGI to simulate the Terminators. Helman said the scene required \"a tremendous amount of visual effects to accomplish, and in some shots, large sections of the bathroom are completely computer generated.\" Mostow said the battle was \"actually a much more complicated sequence from a visual effects standpoint than the audience will ever realize.\"[90] A combination of Schwarzenegger's real body, prosthetics, and CGI were used to create the T-101 for its final scene in the film.[118]\n\n## Music\n\n### Soundtrack\n\nMarco Beltrami composed the musical score. He did not use the series' leitmotif by Brad Fiedel,[119] though it was used in the film's end credits. The film's soundtrack was released by Varèse Sarabande on June 24, 2003:\n\nAll music is composed by Marco Beltrami except \"The Terminator\" and \"I Told You\"\n\n| No.           | Title                                                     | Writer(s)     | Original artist   | Length   |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|\n| 1.            | \"A Day in the Life\"                                       |               |                   | 3:41     |\n| 2.            | \"Hooked on Multiphonics\"                                  |               |                   | 1:47     |\n| 3.            | \"Blonde Behind the Wheel\"                                 |               |                   | 2:07     |\n| 4.            | \"JC Theme\"                                                |               |                   | 3:34     |\n| 5.            | \"Starting T-1\"                                            |               |                   | 1:50     |\n| 6.            | \"Hearse Rent a Car\"                                       |               |                   | 1:48     |\n| 7.            | \"T-X's Hot Tail\"                                          |               |                   | 3:39     |\n| 8.            | \"Graveyard Shootout\"                                      |               |                   | 1:31     |\n| 9.            | \"More Deep Thoughts\"                                      |               |                   | 0:58     |\n| 10.           | \"Dual Terminator\"                                         |               |                   | 0:51     |\n| 11.           | \"Kicked in the Can\"                                       |               |                   | 2:03     |\n| 12.           | \"Magnetic Personality\"                                    |               |                   | 4:35     |\n| 13.           | \"Termina-Tricks\"                                          |               |                   | 2:12     |\n| 14.           | \"Flying Lessons\"                                          |               |                   | 0:56     |\n| 15.           | \"What Do You Want on Your Tombstone?\"                     |               |                   | 1:19     |\n| 16.           | \"Terminator Tangle\"                                       |               |                   | 3:21     |\n| 17.           | \"Radio\"                                                   |               |                   | 2:23     |\n| 18.           | \"T3\"                                                      |               |                   | 3:17     |\n| 19.           | \"The Terminator\" (from the motion picture The Terminator) | Brad Fiedel   | Brad Fiedel       | 2:21     |\n| 20.           | \"Open to Me\" (bonus track)                                | Dillon Dixon  | Dillon Dixon      | 3:46     |\n| 21.           | \"I Told You\" (bonus track)                                | Mia Julia     | Mia Julia         | 3:11     |\n| Total length: | Total length:                                             | Total length: | Total length:     | 51:22    |\n\nSongs that are not included on the soundtrack album\n\n- \"Dat Funky Man\" (performed by William Randolph III; words by Jonathan Mostow)\n- \"Sugar\" (performed by Peter Beckett; words by Jonathan Mostow)\n- \"Party\" (performed by Peter Beckett)\n- \"Can't Hide This\" (performed by Mega Jeff)\n- \"Macho Man\" (performed by Village People)\n- \"The Current\" (performed by Blue Man Group featuring Gavin Rossdale)[120]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe first teaser trailer of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines premiered online and in theaters with Men in Black II in July 2002.[121] On December 13, 2002, the first shot of T-X was revealed on USA Today. Just four days later, a trailer was officially released online. It debuted in theaters a day later on December 18 with the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.[122] The film was also advertised during Super Bowl XXXVII with a television commercial.[123]\n\nIn May 2003, several parties were held in Cannes to promote the film. Also held there was a publicity event that included 10-foot (3.0 m) metal robots, as well as comments from Schwarzenegger about the film.[124] Action figures of the Terminator characters were produced by McFarlane Toys.[125]\n\nAtari adapted the film into three video games, beginning with Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) developed by Black Ops Entertainment for multiple platforms.[126] This was followed by Terminator 3: War of the Machines (2003) and Terminator 3: The Redemption (2004).[127]\n\nOn the weekend of the film's release, NASCAR drivers Jamie McMurray and Michael Waltrip each drove T3-branded cars during races at Daytona International Speedway. The cars featured the likenesses of Schwarzenegger and Loken's characters. In addition, a month after the film was released, Formula One team Jaguar Racing would run their cars with T3 liveries at the 2003 British Grand Prix.[128]\n\n### Theatrical\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines had its premiere at Mann Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles on June 30, 2003.[129][130][131] In the United States, the film was released by Warner Bros. in 3,504 theaters on July 2, 2003.[3][132] Press screenings of the film were very limited prior to release.[132]\n\n### Home media\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines was released on DVD and VHS on November 11, 2003,[133] and on Blu-ray on February 26, 2008.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines earned $150.4 million in the United States and Canada and $283 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $433.4 million.[3] It was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2003.[134]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was released on July 2, 2003. It earned $12.5 million on its first day, including $4 million from Tuesday night previews.[135] The film grossed $44 million during its opening weekend,[136] combined with the $72.5 million five-day Wednesday opening gross.[137] At the time of its opening, it had the fifth-highest opening weekend for an R-rated film, behind The Matrix Reloaded, American Pie 2, 8 Mile, and Hannibal.[138] The film also scored the fourth-highest Fourth of July opening weekend, after Men in Black, Men in Black II, and Independence Day. Moreover, it competed against other films that were released during the summer season like Finding Nemo, The Italian Job, Hulk, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Bruce Almighty, and 2 Fast 2 Furious.[136] These films would even dominate the weaker opening of Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, an underperforming animated film.[139] Additionally, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines surpassed Batman &amp; Robin for having the biggest opening weekend for any film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.[140] It would remain at the top of the box office until it was dethroned by Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl the following week.[141] Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines completed its theatrical run on October 30, 2003, making it the year's eighth-highest-grossing film.[142] Warner Bros. said that the film was meaningfully profitable for them.[143]\n\nWorldwide, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had box office runs in several countries. The film made $1 million from India, making it the country's third-highest opening of any film, behind Die Another Day and Spider-Man.[144] In France, it became the third-highest opening for a 2003 film in the country, trailing only behind Taxi 3 and The Matrix Reloaded.[145] It then made $2.6 million in Italy during its opening weekend.[146] In the United Kingdom, the film made an opening weekend total of $9.6 million.[147] At this point, it had the country's fourth-highest opening for any 2003 film, after Bruce Almighty, The Matrix Reloaded, and X2. With the exception of Batman &amp; Robin and True Lies, the film's four-day gross was superior to the total gross of any Schwarzenegger film released since Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991. Plus, it had earned $1.7 million from previews.[148] Meanwhile, in Japan, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines went on to earn $12.5 million, making it the country's sixth-largest opening of any film. The film had already earned $9.5 million from previews, surpassing Spirited Away's record for having the biggest previews in Japan.[149] It made $1.3 million in Thailand, becoming the second-highest opening of any film in the country, behind The Legend of Suriyothai.[150] In total, the international grosses include Argentina ($2.5 million), Australia ($12.3 million), Austria ($3.4 million) France ($18.9 million), Germany ($19.5 million), India ($2.1 million), Italy ($6.2 million), Japan ($67.5 million), Mexico ($8.9 million), New Zealand ($2.3 million), Russia ($12.8 million), Spain ($13.9 million), and the United Kingdom ($31.2 million).[3]\n\n### Critical response\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines has an approval rating of 70% based on 206 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.5/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"Although T3 never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.\"[151] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines a score of 66 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[152] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[153]\n\nShortly after the film's release, Cameron described the film as \"in one word: great\",[154] but after the release of the fourth film, Terminator Salvation, Cameron added he felt his first two films were better than either of the later films.[155] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said the film \"is essentially a B movie, content to be loud, dumb and obvious\".[156] Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars, remarking \"Essentially one long chase and fight, punctuated by comic, campy or simplistic dialogue.\"[157]\n\nIn retrospect, Director Jonathan Mostow said:\n\n“The problem in Terminator 3 is that Terminator 2 was such a seminal movie. It was going to be impossible to blow people away because T2 was the first time a lot of people saw digital effects. The liquid-metal man, no one had ever seen that before. That and Jurassic Park, those are two movies that probably most have blown people away from seeing them in the theater. I knew that we wouldn’t be able to achieve that. I also knew there was going to be a lot of skepticism. Why do you even need a third Terminator? I felt that I had to disarm those people. So that’s why we made the choice to use humor, which is front-loaded earlier in the movie. Some of it's too shticky, some of it has not aged well with time, I’ll be the first to confess. But if you went to the theater at the time, it worked with the audience.\n\n[158]\n\n### Accolades\n\n|   Year  | Award                                  | Category             | Result    | Recipient(s)          | Ref.              |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n|   2004  | Teen Choice Awards                     | Choice Movie Actor   | Nominated | Arnold Schwarzenegger | [159]             |\n|   2004  | MTV Movie Awards                       | Best Action Sequence | Nominated | Champion Crane Chase  | [160]             |\n|   2004  | ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards | Top Box Office Films | Won       | Marco Beltrami        | [citation needed] |\n\n## Sequel and reboot\n\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines was followed by Terminator Salvation, with the setting moved to the post-apocalyptic future. Although Salvation was intended to launch a new trilogy for the series, the film is considered a failure. This led to Terminator Genisys (2015), a reboot of the franchise which underperformed at the box office.[161][162]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Also known as T3[5]\n- ^ As depicted in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\n- ^ The Chairman is referred to as Admiral James T.

In its plot, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a T-X (Loken)—a highly advanced Terminator—back in time to ensure the rise of machines by killing top members of the future human resistance as John Connor's (Stahl) location is unknown. The resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-850 (Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate (Danes).\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Production>\n        While Terminator creator James Cameron was interested in directing the third film, he ultimately had no involvement with Terminator 3. Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar, who had produced Terminator 2: Judgment Day through their company Carolco Pictures, obtained the rights for the franchise through both Carolco's liquidation auction and negotiations with producer Gale Ann Hurd. In 1999, Tedi Sarafian was hired to write the first draft of the script. Mostow joined the project as director in 2001, and he brought on John Brancato and Michael Ferris to rewrite Sarafian's script. The $187 million budget included a $5 million salary for Mostow and a record $30 million salary for Schwarzenegger. Filming took place in California from April to September 2002.\n    </Production>\n    \n    <Release>\n        Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines premiered at the Mann Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles, on June 30, 2003, and was released on July 2, 2003, by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America. The film received generally positive reviews and earned $433.4 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2003.\n    </Release>\n    \n    <Reception>\n        Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has an approval rating of 70% based on 206 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.5/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"Although T3 never reaches the heights of the second movie, it is a welcome addition to the Terminator franchise.\"\n    </Reception>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to maintain readability while incorporating the required XML tags based on the attributes specified in the ADT.

However, it was conceptually the right direction to take the franchise.\n\nFirst let me be clear: were it up to me the series would've ended after Terminator 2. The first two are iconic and memorable films that still hold up to this day, and just about everyone over the age of 13 knows about them. They tell a complete story; nothing more needed said at Judgment Day's conclusion.\n\nUnfortunately, Hollywood being Hollywood, decided to milk this cash cow franchise dry, and as a result we got three unnecessary sequels with a fourth on the way. With the exception of Salvation, the others have just been retreads of the first two: Skynet sends a Terminator back to kill someone integral to their defeat in the future, someone else from the future is tasked with protecting them, action ensues, and the future is saved...or is it? Throw in a \"I'll be back\" or two and you've got yourself a modern Terminator movie.\n\nTerminator Salvation, at least, felt like it was building up towards the conclusion of what was stated in the first film: John Connor would bring about the fall of Skynet and save humanity. Salvation - put kindly - was messy. The film felt boring. Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) didn't add much to the film and took up way too much screen time that should've gone to John Connor, the man who is tacitly the hero of the franchise (yes I know Sarah Connor and The Terminator/T-800 are technically the main characters and focus of the franchise, but still, John Connor is the one they're all protecting to save the day in the future). Throw in shots and set pieces as dry and lifeless as the post-nuclear wasteland it's set in and you've got yourself an unmemorable film that halts any forward progression of that storyline dead in its tracks. It had some redeeming factors, however, such as Anton Yelchin's performance as Kyle Reese, but overall had too many factors working against it.\n\nBut with better writing and bolder directorial choices, Salvation really could've breathed new life into the franchise and put it on the path to tell new stories. There's a lot of merit to leaving humanity's victory up to the imagination, but if they're going to keep making movies they should at least show us how that victory gets achieved. There are far more stories you can tell with the underdogs rising up against the machines. You can show John Connor becoming the leader he was meant to be. You can show the birth of the resistance and the rallying of humanity. Show that all of the sacrifices up to this point meant something. You can only do so much with the time-travel plot that Rise of the Machines, Genysis, and now Dark Fate have relied upon. That well is starting to run dry, and audiences are looking for fresher springs; Genysis was the lowest grossing Terminator film when adjusted for inflation. If they keep falling back on that crutch, the series won't have a future left.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of June 11, 2019\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of June 2019\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2019\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

This feels similar to The Force Awakens: in itself a slick, decent movie, but I've already watched the much better original, so thanks but no thanks.\n\nPositives? Mackenzie Davis, for whom I've had a hopeless crush since seeing her as a cute NASA geek in The Martian (and then again in Blade Runner 2049), plays a relatable, compelling character, with an intriguing mix of power and vulnerability. There are also a couple of neat set-pieces, especially in the first half, before everything becomes over-the-top tiresome.\n\nLinda Hamilton and Arnold show up for fanservice. It's kind of nice to see them both back with significant roles but, as is typical of fanservice, it's like gorging on too much chocolate: tastes good at first, but then come nausea and a vague feeling of shame.\n\nMy main point is, the Terminator series is now hopeless, as the last movies, especially Genisys, have poisoned the well. The continuity is a mess and keeps being rebooted, so everything is pointless: no development can feel meaningful. Show of hands: who would be particularly surprised if the next Terminator movie was once again about John Connor leading the Resistance in another alternate continuity? No one? Thought so.\n\nAlso, the new villain being so talkative was possibly the single stupidest idea in the whole project. You know why Arnold in T1 and Robert Patrick in T2 were so terrifying? Because they shut up! They said very little and, the few times they spoke, it always felt like something they did out of pure necessity (probing for informations, setting up a trap) but was fundamentally alien to their nature.\n\nThis Rev-9 tries to talk its antagonists out of fighting him! Can anyone picture the T-1000 reasoning with its targets? The great Robert Patrick studied and imitated the body language of birds of prey to look creepier and inhuman, and the new bad guy wants to chat. Give me a break.\n\n5/10\n\n- petra\\_ste\n- Nov 2, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Franchise: Terminated\n\n- JasonXIX\n- Jan 14, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### contains everything thats wrong with hollywood those days\n\nIn its core its a rehash of everything we have seen before only worse. As many said before some characters are almost a parody of their former selfs. The writers wanted to mess with the viewers expectations. So they also included a couple of surprises that no one asked for. They even succeeded in gender swapping a key character which happens a lot in movies theses days. And of course lots of stupid jokes. The action seems to be all CGI so nothing really exiting happening. I hope they won't do another one. Its depressing to see a franchise getting destroyed this way.\n\n- Mynameisroman\n- Aug 30, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Hollywood are completely out of new ideas\n\nIt's the same story as the original only this time with the now common women empowerment theme added to it.\n\nAnd a very irritating Linda Hamilton.\n\nReminds me of how the Force Awakens was a copy of the original SW film but slighten towards women too.\n\nShame but we need some fresh stories. I expected MUCH better from James Cameron.\n\n- james-livingstone\n- Jan 25, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Probably the best post T2 sequel.\n\n- tnelson2-374-411051\n- Nov 26, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Arnie should do comedy\n\nArnie saves this,\nSeen it a few times, skip till when Arnie comes in the movie. He has a great subtle wit about him. This kind of humour would be great to see him do more of.\n\n- petercoleman555\n- Aug 12, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### A Tedious Parody\n\nA truly dark fate for the Terminator franchise.\n\nToo bad, because the film could have been good but the script is disastrous. The T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been turned into a ridiculous parody, and after all the whole film seems like a parody of previous films.\n\nThe dialogues are comical, the characters are hilarious, and the film is tedious and boring. Another franchise that the writers managed to destroy.\n\nThe writers simply could not restrain themselves and managed to destroy this film. The movie had great potential, but in the end it turned out to be a total failure.\n\nThe villain just talks too much and most of the characters are irritating. Not even an R rating can save this disaster.\n\nThe so-called entertainment industry has almost nothing to do with entertainment anymore.\n\nTruly disappointing, this is the reality of today's film production, the good special effects and the catastrophically bad script. Watching this movie turned out to be a total waste of time.\n\nIt's really sad to see what the Terminator franchise has become.\n\n- dk777\n- Apr 5, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### An enjoyable and well made action flick\n\nGreetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Terminator: Dark Fate\" (2019) surprised me of how well it was made and that I actually enjoyed it. Why surprise? Well because of negative responds from critic and most of regular people. But to me surprise, after seeing it i can only say once thing - \"Dark Faith\" is like a masterpiece comparing it to \"Genesys\" and 3rd part. First two of course will ever be on the top, as one of my favorite films ever. And i am in minority when it comes to \"Salvation\", which i highly enjoyed. So now comes \"Dark Faith\" and to my surprise as i said it - I liked it, despite its shortcomings. Maybe the plot revelation at very beginning is a very \"take it or leave\", but i went with it and i highly enjoyed the ride.\n\nOverall, \"Terminator: Dark Fate\" is an excellent \"Terminator\" movie. Its well paced (i wasn't bored for a second during its 2 hours run time). Acting by all of them was great, and Linda was superb. Directing was great as well as involving story - although not original and basically a repeat of previous movies. This is a solid action movie that does not reinvent the wheel, but its an entertaining film.\n\n- RM851222\n- Nov 5, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Crap redo of T2.\n\n- alienlegend\n- Feb 23, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### I don't get the negative reviews\n\nI really enjoyed this movie. I thought the story could have been better, but I thought the acting, action sequences and humor made up for it. This movie isn't perfect but it's a fun movie to go watch that has some heart to it. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good time.\n\n- panthersfreak\n- Nov 1, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Too silly - girls trying to be boys\n\nI've reappraised this. The action is quite good. Arnie is excellent. The problem is the female characters - I don't mind whether they live or die as, with the exception of the younger one they're trying to save, the other two are dreadfully badly written. They've removed any female characteristics and made them them into rather unpleasant men. What's the point - they might as well have had conventional male characters. Where the Alien and earlier Terminator franchises worked was that there was a hint of vulnerability and you willed them on.\n\nThe Mexican/immigrant piece is a bit obvious and tedious too.\n\n- npnjkmgsv\n- Dec 13, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Please no more\n\n- Terryfan\n- Jan 10, 2022\n- Permalink\n\n### A Sarah Connor Chronicle\n\nThe Terminator franchise is a defining one in the genres of sci-fi, action and horror. While the imagery and the catchphrases have become ingrained in popular culture, the film series has struggled to recapture the glory of the first two entries. The underrated spinoff television series was sadly short-lived. James Cameron, who directed the first two films and helmed the theme park attraction but has had no direct involvement in the series since then, returns as a producer for this sixth film.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate learns from the failure of the previous entries. The most recent Terminator film before this, Terminator: Genisys, was a jumbled mess of multiple timelines and attempted to remix beloved elements of the series, alienating fans in the process. Dark Fate benefits from more of a back-to-basics approach, presenting a straightforward story without relying too much on exposition. It functions as a direct sequel to Judgement Day, with all the other films taking place in alternate timelines. This is not dissimilar to 2018's Halloween, which was a direct sequel to the 1978 movie and ignored the many sequels that were made in the intervening years.\n\nThe film's biggest asset is Linda Hamilton, who has not appeared in any of the films since Judgement Day. This is much more than the glorified cameo which we could've gotten, with the Sarah Connor character front and centre.\nHamilton took some convincing to come back on board, and the film really wouldn't have worked if she had said no. Hamilton easily conveys the no-nonsense toughness fans of the series know and love, but also delivers a genuinely good performance beyond that. The R-rating means that she gets to swear a whole lot, and she's amazing at it. There are several moments when just a look from Hamilton tells us so much. This is a character who has been through the wringer and would like the world to think she can just shrug it off, but there is a lot of sadness and pain that she's internalised - when those shards are visible, that's when Hamilton's immense contribution to the movie really registers.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger appears in more of a supporting capacity, but completely steals the show when he's onscreen. The film wisely makes use of Schwarzenegger's comedic talents while also preserving the formidable physical power associated with the T-800 character.\n\nOne scene in the film showcases the most convincing digital de-aging/face replacement effects I've ever seen.\n\nThe film clearly aspires to the heights of Judgement Day, so it is noticeable when it falls short of those heights. There are moments when the film is almost emotional, and while there are some moving beats, there is nothing nearly as sublime as \"I know now why you cry, but it's something that I could never do.\" While the stronger connection to the first two films anchors Dark Fate in the tone and mythos of the earlier movies, it also prevents the movie from being too innovative on its own terms. Also, much of the events in Judgement Day seem to have been rendered moot - not quite to the level of \"Ripley finds Newt and Hicks dead at the beginning of Alien 3,\" but it does approach that.\n\nWhile some action sequences are brilliantly executed, others feel just a touch too synthetic. The visual effects are leaps and bounds over the somewhat unpolished work seen in Genisys, but there are still moments when one thing made of CGI is being thrown into another thing also made of CGI. Out of necessity, the earlier films made ingenious use of practical animatronic effects and miniature models. Director Tim Miller of Deadpool fame is a co-founder of Blur Studio, best known for making animated cutscenes and cinematics for video games. The action sequences in Dark Fate can sometimes come off as a little too video game-esque, but Miller does often demonstrate a keen awareness of how to place elements in space to create action sequences.\n\nThe Dani character is sympathetic and Natalia Reyes gives the role her all, but she can sometimes come off as a little whiny and is not written that well.\n\nAnother way that the film echoes Judgement Day is in its villain, the shape-shifting Rev-9. Like Robert Patrick, Gabriel Luna is less conspicuous in a crowd than Arnold Schwarzenegger, meaning the Rev-9 is more convincing as an infiltration unit. It also has a neat gimmick of being able to separate itself into liquid metal outer shell and endoskeleton, allowing it to perform tag-team attacks. Rev-9 is perhaps a touch too indestructible, such that the action sequences become a little repetitive.\n\nMackenzie Davis' Grace is a great addition to the canon. This reviewer enjoys seeing actors whom one wouldn't typically associate with action movies take on action-heavy roles. Davis underwent a complete physical transformation to play the muscular, angular Grace. There is a tragedy to the character, who has sacrificed her physical autonomy for the cause, so she is always sympathetic.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is in a way commenting on the history of the series. There is so much that's memorable about the first two Terminator films that it's hard to resist the temptation to make constant references to them. Yes, Sarah Connor does say \"I'll be back\", but Dark Fate demonstrates restraint and refuses to lean on the series' storied past as a crutch.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is not a film that strictly needs to exist, but by building a strong connection to the second film and by getting Linda Hamilton back in a starring role, it satisfyingly echoes the franchise at its best.\n\n- jeddjong\n- Oct 22, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Not a bad sequel to the first 2\n\nThe action scenes are the best I've watched, the CGI and deaging of the actors because of the end of the second installment (28 years ago) is amazing. All effects in general are very good. Good direction. The performances seeems VERY GOOD. Still it seems saturated with the action, too much and lacks taste. The film also starts well and then falls into a hole and has a hard time getting out, SSSLOWWW and when Arnie comes, it gets up; i don't feel good tempo; slow by pieces and a lot of action on others, that is, I don't think it has a good editing. Is it bad? NOT AT ALL, but it didn't convince me. Worthy sequel to the first 2. Many will hate it for what they did with a certain character.\n\n- JoeYabuki\n- Oct 30, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Insane\n\nDoing the same thing expecting different results .\nWhat is the point? This PC bs is to contrived and forced\nTakes away from the film going experience !\nBesides what is different ? It is same story we've seen in the first 2.\n\n- celt007\n- Nov 4, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Might've been worse, yet, it's fine\n\nAs a huge Terminator fan, I am rather fine than dissatisfied with Dark Fate.\n\nReviews are full of hatred and devastation... Apparently, I wasn't expecting a legendary T-movie as if we were talking about T-1 and T-2. You can't touch them and you shouldn't. Though Dark Fate puts its events after T-2, it can't be matched with the other two Big T-s.\n\nYes, there are plenty of clichés in the plot and all of them are painfully boring. Sure, there are some gaps and theory-craft moments, but still. Maybe it's just me... Yet, I was expecting worse. Much, much worse.\n\nIn fact, Dark Fate is more like Action + Terminator, rather than Terminator + Action. All in all, the movie is fine. If you are a big T-fan, just give it a go. I'm sure, you are gonna be AT LEAST okay with it.\n\n- AnInspirat10n\n- Oct 30, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Terminator is dead now. Let it go.\n\n- adamjawesome\n- Oct 25, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Best since T2\n\nGave it a 10 to boost the numbers, because this one certainly beats other sequels after T2. Third best in my opinion. Not perfect (the Mexican girl could've been given more depth, to name something) but no other sequel was perfect either. Cheesy, corny, yeah, but so were the others. The acting was good, there was some nostalgia (Linda and Arnie back in) and a lot of action reminiscent of T1 and T2. I was surprised at all the hate reviews. Then I took a good look at what people were saying and I realized it's mostly the fact that 3 women have the lead. A lot of these hate reviews here are shockingly misogynistic and old fashioned. Grow up, boys.\n\n- Roma73\n- Feb 23, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Familiar plot with added oestrogen.\n\n- BA\\_Harrison\n- Oct 22, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Disappointing follow up\n\nI'm a huge Terminator fan, I re-watched both 1 &amp; 2 before seeing this. Big mistake.\n\nI'm gutted to say that this film has none of what makes Terminator 2 one of the best films of all time. The writing is below par, plot uninteresting and emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor, none of that either. James Cameron, what is this? Mind, I don't think he's been on form for a good few years now.\n\nWhat makes Terminator 2 an amazing film aside from the brilliant plot, amazing effects, great screen writing and superb acting is the emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor. This is the life blood of that film and makes the viewer really believe that despite the hopeless future humanity is facing, if this Terminator can protect John then maybe mankind has a chance. The Terminator is a father figure to John and this is what connects the audience with the film so much. The heart wrenching ending cannot be forgotten. The fact that we forget the the Terminator isn't human because of how well the film builds the bond. This is what makes Terminator 2 so great, not the epic action sequences.\n\nSo I'm sad to say this film has absolutely none of that. CGI, CGI and more CGI. Do away with the depth of character building, emotional connections and just add over the top action. It's a poor follow up and lacks everything of what made 1 &amp; 2 great. The acting is decent, Davis, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger do a good job but they've got very little to work with here. This is what disappointed me the most. Why does it lack substance? This is James Cameron's epic creation and this is what he serves up along with Tim Miller? A total cash in if I've ever seen one. I'm not going to divulge into the plot anymore, there's no need as it can't even be mentioned in the same breath as the first two films.\n\nIf this film was viewed as a generic action film at the cinema it'd still be mediocre. The fact that this is supposed to follow on from the brilliant Terminator 2 just makes it even more disappointing. This is James Cameron's judgment day.\n\nDo yourselves a favour and wait until it hits home release or if you are planning on seeing it, don't bother watching the first two beforehand, you'll be even more disappointed.\n\n- fieldy-60138\n- Oct 23, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Dark Fate is a Dark Fart\n\nIf you are a fan of the first 2 Terminator movies , a fan of the characters Sara Conner , John Conner , and Arnold's first Terminator then don't waste your time and money on this piece of crap. This movie undoes and destroys the original Terminator movie characters with time twisting and ludicrous story gymnastics that obliterates the entire original Terminator that's all idiotic crap writing. I would never had imagined that a movie sequel could be this bad but it is. Listen to a spoiler review first , I wish I had, and you will be shocked as to how bad this movie is written .\n\n- harosyn-10350\n- Nov 1, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### \"Put Da Cookie Dow-hnn!\"\n\n*Plays Iconic T2 Background Music*\n\nIn AD 2019, realizing that the future was boring after Judgement day was prevented, James Cameron and his nefarious backers sent a new T-800 robot back to eliminate John Connor for good. This time they succeeded. What was the purpose? To make them lots and lots of money.\n\nUnfortunately, the plan went awry and the 300 million dollar project (production + marketing) flopped with a 62 million dollar box office standing. Even by sending back more robots around the world through various international releases the total only went up $261 million. It was too late, the damage was beyond repair. The franchise had been terminated.\n\nWhat would have happened if John Connor would not have been killed? Would we have avoided this Dark Fate?\n\n- DeusWar\n- Dec 18, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Stop making women (and men) look bad!\n\n- demen-92535\n- May 27, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Pretty Good\n\nThis in not a bad film at all. It was a different take, down a similar path for different reasons. I am not going to put any spoilers here. But, maybe someone or something survives this. I was disappointed in the ending a bit.\n\nI thought the action was really good and loved the fact they didn't use complete CGI during a little highway scene. Even shown from the trailers, there is a scene reminiscent of T2 which I thought looked wicked good. I was surprised how good that scene was during the movie. \"Woah...cool...\" is hard to say when you completely expect what is going to happen, but it definitely was. From all the acting in the movie, the only thing I didn't like was Linda Hamilton's meeting with Arnold. You'll have to see it to see what I mean.\n\nFrom an original perspective, we have kinda seen this before. But like some posts that I have read, this I feel is far better than all those released since T2. If you like action, this is a good film. The CGI is done very well and no expense was held back there. All in all, I left the theatre thinking...\"that was pretty good'.\n\nIt's not a Marvel film, or a Disney film (Star Wars...etc.etc..), nor is it going to win an Oscar. But it was an enjoyable movie that I didn't mind spending money on. The food that I bought to watch it. That's another story.\n\n- jduran-27572\n- Nov 13, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Hollow cash grab\n\nThis film was garbage. I walked out. Hollow plot, hollow dialogue, therefore hollow acting.

For fans, it's a good adaptation of a problematic novel - so good that it suffers from many of the book's flaws.\n\nWhen beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.\n\nDivergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.\n\nCome the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.\n\nHere's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.\n\nIn fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.\n\nOf course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.\n\nThe young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.\n\nIn the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical.\n\n- shawneofthedead\n- Mar 18, 2014\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ1\n\n- What is the instrumental song as they run for the train?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - April 10, 2014 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Spanish\n- Also known as\n    - Divergente\n- Filming locations\n    - Chicago, Illinois, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Summit Entertainment\n    - Red Wagon Entertainment\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $85,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $150,947,895\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $54,607,747\n    - Mar 23, 2014\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $288,885,818\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 19 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - Datasat\n    - SDDS\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - Auro 11.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n    - 2.39 : 1(original ratio)\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I pull up in the line, and the boys go, 'Johnny Rico! Why didn't you tell us your dad was Johnny Rico?' And I said, 'What are you boys doing watching STARSHIP TROOPERS?' And they said, 'Our dads made us watch it with them!' Then my daughters get in the car, and my ten-year-old says, 'Dad, were you really naked in STARSHIP TROOPERS?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and she said, 'How could you do that to me?!' Then my eight-year-old says, 'Wait, like naked naked?' And I said 'Yup,' and she said, 'Oh my God, my life is ruined!' That was the longest three minute ride home I have had in my life.\"\n\n- GoofsWhen Rasczak's mobile infantry troop are on their way to investigate the distress call on Planet P, Rico is scanning the tops of the canyon walls with binoculars. When he almost sees the winged Arachnid, there are rocks falling. A hand can be seen lobbing one of the rocks over the wall.\n\n- QuotesJean Rasczak: Come on you apes! You want to live forever?\n\n- Alternate versionsSeveral scenes were modified to tone down the movie for showing on Russian television. Aside from cutdowns similar to the Australian version to tone down the violence, of note is a modification to the video feed scene (where Rico 'walks' Carmen through his surroundings, camera in hand) - when his teammates take off their pants to moon the camera, static was added to cover the nudity up. Also, the shower room and the sex scene were slightly cut to remove frontal nudity.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Starship Troopers: Deleted Scenes (1998)\n\n- SoundtracksInto It\nProduced by Terry Becker (as Terri Becker), Bernard Estardy, Zoë Poledouris and Christopher Tyng\nWritten and Performed by Zoë Poledouris\n\n### User reviews1.2K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Starship Troopers: A Satirical Masterpiece Worth Revisiting\n\nStarship Troopers, directed by Paul Verhoeven and released in 1997, is a science fiction film that explores themes of fascism, militarism, and citizenship. The film is set in the future where Earth is threatened by a race of giant insects, known as the \"bugs,\" and humanity must band together to defeat the enemy. The film follows protagonist, Johnny Rico, as he joins the military to fight against the bugs and eventually becomes an officer.\n\nThe film's satirical elements are particularly noteworthy, as it takes aim at the military-industrial complex and the concept of war as a solution to conflict. The film is not afraid to be bold and make commentary on the political landscape of the time, including the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. This satirical edge is what sets Starship Troopers apart from other science fiction films and is what makes it such a fascinating and thought-provoking work of art.\n\nThe film's visual effects are also top-notch, with the giant bugs being both fearsome and disgusting, making them the perfect enemy to fight against. The film also makes use of excellent special effects, particularly the scenes of battle, which are both chaotic and thrilling. The film's action is well choreographed and serves to keep the audience on the edge of their seat.\n\nOne of the film's strengths is its portrayal of the characters, who are well-developed and memorable. Johnny Rico is the classic action hero, while his friends and comrades are equally interesting and unique. The film also features strong performances from its cast, particularly Casper Van Dien as Johnny Rico, who delivers a standout performance.\n\nWhile some may argue that the film's humor is too over-the-top and detracts from the overall experience, it is important to understand that this is a deliberate choice made by Verhoeven. The film's humor serves to emphasize its satirical elements and reinforces its messages. The humor also adds an element of fun to what is otherwise a dark and intense film.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of \"Starship Troopers\" is its sharp, tongue-in-cheek commentary on fascism and military propaganda. Throughout the film, characters make bold statements about the importance of enlisting in the military and sacrificing for the greater good, all while caricatured military drills and propaganda videos are played for comic effect. The film's over-the-top take on these themes is both entertaining and thought-provoking, leaving the viewer with a lot to ponder long after the credits have rolled.\n\nOverall, while \"Starship Troopers\" may not be for everyone, its unique blend of sci-fi action and satirical commentary is sure to leave a lasting impression on those who appreciate its distinct brand of humor and filmmaking style. Despite its flaws, this film is a must-see for fans of science fiction and action, and it's certainly deserving of an 8/10 rating.\n\n- Hastur16\n- Feb 10, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n## Everything New on Prime Video in March\n\n## Everything New on Prime Video in March\n\nYour guide to all the new movies and shows streaming on Prime Video in the US this month.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### FAQ10\n\n- Zandar Barcalow &amp;amp; Johnny Rico play for different sports teams but they were both at the same prom.

Its storyline centres on a teenage street gang who have to defend themselves from predatory alien invaders on a council estate in South London on Guy Fawkes Night. It was the film debut of Cornish, Boyega, and composer Steven Price.\n\nReleased on 11 May 2011, Attack the Block underperformed at the box office but received positive reception from the critics, with particular praise for Cornish's direction and Boyega's performance. It also received several international accolades.[5]\n\n## Plot\n\nOn Guy Fawkes Night, trainee nurse Samantha Adams is mugged by a gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest, Dennis, Jerome, Biggz and leader Moses. When a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a dog-sized alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer Ron and his boss Hi-Hatz, a local gang leader, who instead recruits Moses to work for him.\n\nMore objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site, where they find one dead alien, but other living aliens. However, they find these aliens are much larger and more threatening. After one kills Dennis's pet pitbull Pogo, the gang flee but are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives it away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car when they pass through a nearby building's parking space. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman, who accuse Moses of trying to kill Hi-Hatz in order to replace him as the local drug lord. An alien arrives and kills the henchman but is killed in turn by Hi-Hatz.\n\nThe gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, a tower block, but are attacked outside by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin, though he is later saved by a pair of their young neighbours who manage to kill the alien. Meanwhile, Pest is bitten in the leg by an alien who breaks into their building. They discover that Samantha also lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts into her flat and Moses kills it with a samurai sword. Realising that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them.\n\nThe gang move upstairs to the flat where Tia, Dimples, Dionna and Gloria live, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. Two aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and decapitating Dennis. Samantha kills an alien, saving Moses in the process, while Tia and Dimples manage to kill the other one by ganging up on it. The girls believe the boys to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen arrive and attack the gang, blaming them for the death of the first henchman, but another alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift; only Hi-Hatz makes it out alive.\n\nMaking their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang run into more aliens, but use fireworks as a distraction and manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find Hi-Hatz waiting, who prepares to shoot Moses but he is then suddenly attacked and killed by the rest of the aliens who break in through the window. The group flee and are joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a zoology student. Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n\nIn the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a habitable planet; after landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong pheromone to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species; Moses has been carrying scent since he killed the female, which is how the males have always been able to find them. Moses persuades Pest to return Samantha's stolen ring and together they form a plan. As Samantha has not been stained with the alien pheromone she can to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.\n\nSamantha successfully bypasses the aliens and turns on the gas in the flat. She leaves the tower block, and Moses, with the corpse of the small female alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas-filled flat with all of the big male aliens following him. He throws the corpse into the flat; with a firework he ignites the room and leaps out of the window. The resulting explosion kills all the aliens but leaves the high-rise flat in flames. Moses survives by grabbing onto a flag hanging from the balcony.\n\nIn the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis and Ron are arrested and held responsible by the arriving police for all of the recent deaths around the block that night. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers who had arrested Moses earlier. Instead, Samantha says the boys are her neighbours and they protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses; they both smile.\n\n## Cast\n\nRepresentative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast (many of whom spoke Multicultural London English during the film) were young, relative unknowns and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.[6] John Boyega found out about this film from an advert placed on the internet. The cast includes:\n\n- John Boyega as Moses, a low-level crook, teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.\n- Jodie Whittaker as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of Wyndham Tower.\n- Alex Esmail as Pest, a teenage jokester, pyromaniac and loyal second-in-command of Moses's gang.\n- Franz Drameh as Dennis, a hotheaded pizza delivery boy and the enforcer of the gang.\n- Leeon Jones as Jerome, the most level-headed member of the gang and the most academically inclined.\n- Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a recycling bin after he is cornered by the aliens.\n- Nick Frost as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of Wyndham Tower and knows everyone.\n- Luke Treadaway as Brewis, a posh student stoner who is one of Ron's customers.\n- Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, the local psychopathic gangster who is Ron's feared boss.\n- Danielle Vitalis as Tia, a girl living in Wyndham Tower who is Moses's love interest and friend to the gang.\n- Paige Meade as Dimples, Tia's quick tempered roommate who is also a friend to the gang.\n- Sammy Williams as Probs, a child who wishes to join Moses's gang.\n- Michael Ajao as Mayhem, Probs's best friend, who shares his goal of joining Moses's gang.\n- Jacey Sallés as Biggz's mum.\n- Karl Collins as Dennis' dad.\n- Joey Ansah as Policeman.\n- Chris Wilson as arresting Police Officer.\n\n## Production\n\nBig Talk Pictures, known for films including Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, produced the film alongside Film4, The UK Film Council and StudioCanal.[2]\n\nThe plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. The director wanted to counter the trend of 'hoodie horror' films which demonised urban youths.[7] Cornish also based the character of the stoner Brewis on himself in his twenties.\n\n### Filming\n\nAttack the Block is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the Stockwell district of London. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:\n\nWe wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early on, and since we couldn't show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.[8]\n\nThe name Wyndham Tower appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional tower block, referencing the English science-fiction writer John Wyndham, author of the 1953 novel, 'The Kraken Wakes' , which similarly begins with aliens invading Earth from outer space, as well as other science-fiction monster works such as 'Day of the Triffids'. Other buildings in the estate are named for J. G. Ballard, author of a number of novels set in large urban tower blocks, including High-Rise where mayhem breaks out in a high-rise London apartment block, and famous science fiction authors H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley and Douglas Adams.\n\nThe film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with six weeks of night shoots[9] on the Heygate Estate in Elephant and Castle; Myatts Field, Brixton; Oval Underground station and the Bemerton Estate in Islington. Interior scenes were filmed at Three Mills Studios in Newham, part of the East End of London.[10]\n\n### Creature effects\n\nThe creatures began with two men in gorilla-like suits with animatronic jaws; post-production added the unearthly qualities such as the spiky fur which doesn't reflect any light, the claws, the rows of bioluminescent jaws, and even some of their movement. In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house Fido.[11] The creatures have no eyes, navigating their environments by echolocation and using a highly developed sense of smell to hunt and find mates. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of dolphin sonar mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.[12] Some puppets were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast. In 2023, Cornish stated the creature designs were partly based on his pet cat who \"engulfs darkness\".\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nStudioCanal's British distribution company Optimum Releasing released the film in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2011. Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions acquired the film's distribution rights for North America and Latin America,[13] and the group opened the film in limited theatrical release in the United States on 29 July 2011 through Screen Gems.[14] US distributors were concerned that American audiences might not understand the strong South London accents, and may have even used subtitles if it were to be released in the United States.[15] Cornish acknowledged this during the SXSW Q and A. When he asked the audience, \"Can I ask you guys something? American distributors are nervous about language, the slang\" the audience said they could understand it.[16]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2011 and in the United States on 25 October 2011. Play.com released an exclusive Blu-ray and DVD double play edition, with a glow-in-the-dark sleeve, featuring the bio-luminescent jaws of one of the creatures.[17]\n\n### Soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack for the film was an original score composed by British electronic music group Basement Jaxx, and Steven Price except for a few songs featured in the film but not on the soundtrack (such as the 1993 rap track \"Sound of da Police\" by KRS-One, and the 2006 reggae track \"Youths Dem Cold\" by Richie Spice, played during the end credits). A rap song called \"Get That Snitch\", original to the film and rapped by the character Hi-Hatz, is featured at various times in the film. The full song was featured on the DVD special features. The score and soundtrack album was mixed by Gareth Cousins.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nOn its opening theatrical weekend in the United Kingdom in May 2011, Attack the Block garnered £1,133,859, putting it in third place only slightly behind American blockbusters Thor and Fast Five; also in the opening weekend Attack the Block had the highest cinema site average by almost twice of the other films.[18] On a screen-by-screen basis, Attack the Block was the week's strongest performer.[19] In North America, the film's theatrical run began in July 2011 and was a box office flop[20] despite receiving overall good reviews. Its theatrical run began in July 2011 and, in limited release for less than two months with 66 cinemas at its peak, it managed to gross US$1,024,175 in North America.[3]\n\n### Critical response\n\nAttack the Block received acclaim from critics. Review aggregation Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on 183 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Effortlessly mixing scares, laughs, and social commentary, Attack the Block is a thrilling, briskly-paced sci-fi yarn with a distinctly British flavor.\"[21] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[22]\n\nThe website Slash film lists Attack the Block as a \"true cult classic\" deserving of its own action figures.[23] In his review, Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert praised the film's use of character development and the performance given by Boyega.[24] Scott Wampler of The Examiner rated it A+ and said it was officially the best film of the 2011 film festival season and likened it to other debuts such as Neill Blomkamp's District 9 and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.[25] Matt Patches writing for Cinemablend said \"Attack the Block, even on its small scale, may wind up as one of the best action movies of the year\".[26] Christ Tilly at IGN gave it four stars saying \"Cornish directs with the confidence of a seasoned pro\" and calling the film \"a blast from start-to-finish.\"[27] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy awarded the movie four stars, saying that it is \"exactly the kind of distinctly homegrown product that the British film industry should be making\".[28] Mark Kermode gave a mixed review saying he did not dislike the film, but \"wanted it to be funnier\" and \"needed it to be scarier\".[29]\n\nAttack the Block was revisited by critics following the casting of its two lead actors as stars of flagship science fiction franchises – Boyega as Finn in Star Wars and Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor in Doctor Who. In a 2017 retrospective, Tom Philip writing for GQ described the film as \"one of the most confidently-delivered debut feature films in recent memory\" and said it \"still stands out as one of the best genre-mashup films of the decade\",[30] while Nathan Rabin for Rotten Tomatoes said that the film deserved cult status and called it \"a star-making vehicle in the truest sense\".[31] It was listed among Wired Magazine's best films of the 2010s.[32]\n\n### Accolades\n\n- Audience Award for Best Film (Midnights) at SXSW 2011[33]\n- Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Los Angeles Film Festival[34]\n- Audience Award for Best European or American Feature at the 2011 Fantasia Festival[35]\n- Melies d'Argent for Best European Fantastic Feature Film 2011 at the Lund International Fantastic Film Festival[36]\n- Muut Award for Best Visual Concept at the 2011 Miskolc International Film Festival[37]\n- Bassan Arts and Crafts Award for Best Production Design at the Torino Film Festival 2011[38]\n- Golden Mouse Online Critics Award for Best Film at the Torino Film Festival 2011[39]\n- Best Debut Director at the 2011 New York Film Critics Online Awards\n- Best First Feature at the 2011 Toronto Film Critics Association Awards[40]\n- Best Original Soundtrack at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival[41]\n- Special Jury Award at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival[41]\n- Audience Award for Best Motion Picture at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival[41]\n- Jose Luis Guarner Critic Award at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival[41]\n- Special Mention at the 2011 Black Film Critics Circle Awards: \"Attack The Block is a genre film that defies a number of conventions, not only by having a primarily black cast but portraying each character with a dignity seldom seen on screen and even more rarely in a Science-Fiction film.\"[42]\n- Best First Film at the 2011 Austin Film Critics Association Awards[43]\n- Best Original Score at the 2011 Austin Film Critics Association Awards[43]\n- Best Actor to John Boyega at the 2011 Black Reel Awards[44]\n- Outstanding Foreign Film at the 2011 Black Reel Awards[44]\n\n## Sequel\n\nIn May 2021, it was announced that Cornish would be writing and directing a sequel, with Boyega set to reprise his role and produce.[45]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Attack the Block\". bbfc.co.uk.

When a meteorite falls from the sky into a nearby car, Samantha escapes. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a dog-sized alien creature. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the dead animal to their acquaintance, cannabis dealer <b>Ron</b> and his boss <b>Hi-Hatz</b>, a local gang leader, who instead recruits Moses to work for him.\n        \n        More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site, where they find one dead alien, but other living aliens. However, they find these aliens are much larger and more threatening. After one kills Dennis's pet pitbull Pogo, the gang flee but are intercepted by two policemen accompanying Samantha, and Moses is arrested. The aliens follow Moses and maul the unarmed officers to death, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside a van. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives it away, only to crash into Hi-Hatz's car when they pass through a nearby building's parking space. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman, who accuse Moses of trying to kill Hi-Hatz in order to replace him as the local drug lord. An alien arrives and kills the henchman but is killed in turn by Hi-Hatz.\n        \n        The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower, a tower block, but are attacked outside by the aliens; Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin, though he is later saved by a pair of their young neighbours who manage to kill the alien. Meanwhile, Pest is bitten in the leg by an alien who breaks into their building. They discover that Samantha also lives in their building and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts into her flat and Moses kills it with a samurai sword. Realising that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha joins them.\n        \n        The gang move upstairs to the flat where Tia, Dimples, Dionna, and Gloria live, believing that their security gate will keep them safe. Two aliens instead attack from outside, smashing through the windows and decapitating Dennis. Samantha kills an alien, saving Moses in the process, while Tia and Dimples manage to kill the other one by ganging up on it. The girls believe the boys to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. Hi-Hatz and two more henchmen arrive and attack the gang, blaming them for the death of the first henchman, but another alien arrives and chases Hi-Hatz and the henchmen into a lift; only Hi-Hatz makes it out alive.\n        \n        Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang run into more aliens, but use fireworks as a distraction and manage to get through. Jerome becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat, they find Hi-Hatz waiting, who prepares to shoot Moses but he is then suddenly attacked and killed by the rest of the aliens who break in through the window. The group flee and are joined by Brewis, one of Ron's customers and a zoology student. Moses, Pest, and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.\n        \n        In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the ultraviolet light. Brewis theorises that the aliens are like spores, drifting through space on solar winds until they chance on a habitable planet; after landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong pheromone to attract the male creatures so that they can mate and propagate their species; Moses has been carrying scent since he killed the female, which is how the males have always been able to find them. Moses persuades Pest to return Samantha's stolen ring and together they form a plan. As Samantha has not been stained with the alien pheromone she can go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.\n        \n        Samantha successfully bypasses the aliens and turns on the gas in the flat. She leaves the tower block, and Moses, with the corpse of the small female alien strapped to his back, runs to the gas-filled flat with all of the big male aliens following him. He throws the corpse into the flat; with a firework he ignites the room and leaps out of the window. The resulting explosion kills all the aliens but leaves the high-rise flat in flames. Moses survives by grabbing onto a flag hanging from the balcony.\n        \n        In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible by the arriving police for all of the recent deaths around the block that night. The police then ask Samantha to identify Moses and his friends as those who killed everyone, including the two police officers who had arrested Moses earlier. Instead, Samantha says the boys are her neighbours and they protected her. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses; they both smile.\n    </Plot>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains coherent and informative while highlighting key details with XML tags.

I wanted to watch this movie because I only read good reviews of it at the time (94% on rotten tomatoes ) .

It felt so child-ish and so insulting to anyone watching. I felt like the movie was literally insulting my brain and ignoring my ability to determine what is absurd and what is not.

Other characters (like the \"evil\" side) are, unfortunately, not developed at all, but the siblings side is amazing. The plot is somewhat guessable (at least the general outcome), but there's plenty of good action and also a tough and controversial discussion about overpopulation - I'll leave it out of this review, but the thoughts from the movie go quite deep into how society could turn one day. That's also connected to the (small) frustration over the lack of other characters development, there's a rich ground for more elaborate story - but that shouldn't stop you from watching this film, it's very good!\n\n- hydralien-40230\n- May 22, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 18, 2017 (United Kingdom)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - France\n    - United States\n    - Belgium\n- Official site\n    - Splendid Film (Germany)\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - ¿Qué le pasó a Lunes?\n- Filming locations\n    - Constanta, Romania\n- Production companies\n    - Vendome Pictures\n    - Nexus Factory\n    - Raffaella Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $27,975,429\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 3 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of What Happened to Monday (2017) in Australia?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I'm not sure if the message was inconsistent/confusing or if I'm looking at it the wrong way.\n\nSpecifically, I found it strange that it's supposed to be critical of capitalism, Reagan-era politics, etc. while seemingly saying repo men are really cool and badass, which seems contradictory with the otherwise leftist sympathies of the satire. This makes sense if the repo men are the subjects of the satire as well, but I don't usually expect the protagonist to be criticized like that so I may have just missed it. I found the repo men, including Otto, to not really be the most sympathetic characters, but I wasn't really sure if I was meant to or not.\n\nCan anyone clear this up for me, and/or elaborate on what the satire/themes of Repo Man are?\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of November 6, 2015\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of November 2015\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2015\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

The prize is to move to a paradisiacal island outside the domes that protect the dwellers against the contaminated environment. Jordan wins the lottery, and Lincoln accidentally finds the scary truth behind the utopist award.\n\n\"The Island\" is an original, intriguing and scary view of science, ethic and society in a near future. Using elements of \"Logan's Run\", \"Matrix\", \"Gattaca\" and \"The Thirteenth Floor\", among other sci-fi movies, and non-stop action, it is a surprisingly great film. I liked very much the amoral behavior of Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), with a total lack of ethic, and the possibility of replacement parts raised in the story. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor shows a good chemistry, and watching this sci-fi / action movie is worthwhile, even to think how cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied laws. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"A Ilha\" (\"The Island\")\n\n- claudio\\_carvalho\n- Dec 9, 2005\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ2\n\n- What is Merrick's first name?\n- Why did Institute guards laugh at Starkweather's escape attempt?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - July 28, 2005 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Warner Bros (France)\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - La isla\n- Filming locations\n    - Rhyolite, Nevada, USA(ghost town)\n- Production companies\n    - Dreamworks Pictures\n    - Warner Bros.\n    - Parkes/MacDonald Image Nation\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $126,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $35,818,913\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $12,409,070\n    - Jul 24, 2005\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $162,949,164\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 16 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - SDDS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I Googled all around and couldn't find accurate answers for these so I figured I'd come here.\n\n- What was in the vaccine they all got? It looked as though they were heading toward sepsis with the state of their arms at the end. Would also explain the girl vomiting - but why?\n- What is the punishment Viv went through \"downstairs\". It's believed that if you go \"downstairs\" you're skinned, but she came back up? My first guess would be SA but it isn't really elaborated on.\n- Miss B was definite the woman on the TV as well, right? Before she had the transplant? What happened to her at the end?\n\nThis is more of a nit pick, but there would have to be SO MANY PEOPLE complicit in this scheme for it to even remotely work. It gave me Hostel vibes - in that, there would be way too many loose ends for this to happen... the clients, the parents, the guards, etc. It seems so wild to me that a couple and the guards would raise 20-50 girls for 16+ years, not get attached to a single one, and then just kill them. It's so unrealistic that it took me out of it completely. I know this isn't a movie about realism, but come on. What would make more sense is if they had a rotating group of staff or something so that no one gets attached, but then again you have the first problem I mentioned of too many people in on the scheme. Also 16 is a WILD age and to think you can control girls at that age even if you've been keeping them captive is insane. Hormones, etc. will make them act out. Unless they were on a hormone repression cocktails? It's never discussed. That would make sense since there is no talk about menstruation, no acne, etc. I am just frustrating a detail like that was left out completely.\n\nI found part of this movie good, but a lot of it was confusing and irritating. What did you guys think?\n\nI just REALLY want to know what was in the \"vaccine\" and what was in the vitamins other than just sleeping pills.

He's an appealing guy and was good in this.\n\n-De Niro didn't suck - and he's sucked real hard recently.\n\n-Generally well put together and as a whole entertaining.\n\n-A nice 'high concept', er... concept.\n\n-A pretty decent fight scene.\n\nNow that's over with...\n\n-\"You know we only use 20% of our brain?\" Fuck you, movie screenwriter. That's a bullshit myth and the 'correct number' is 10%. But hey, this is fine - perhaps it 'overclocks' the brain... but don't use the '10%' myth to do it - it's lazy and it insults my intelligence.\n\n-You have 'limitless' potential from a drug that supercharges your brain. It makes you the best you you can ever be - a confident, motivated genius who can do anything. Bradley Cooper begins the movie a struggling book writer, but apparently that ambition is a bit 'limited', because he writes an amazing novel in a few days. He drops all his old ambitions and decides to become a stockbroker and make lots of money. Wait... what? This guy is a fucking genius and at the pinnacle of human condition and he uses it to get rich on the stock market? Couldn't he have worked on a cure for cancer or something? No... he's too busy fucking women and making money. He then decides the next highest ambition a person can have is to run for senator. Fuck you Bradley Cooper and fuck you Screen Writer - how about making an actual difference instead of generating as much money and personal power for yourself as you are capable of.\n\nThat's my biggest gripe - that ** apparently the highest ambition a man can work to is to be a stock broker and then a politician.**\n\n-The moral of the story is: Use illegal performance enhancing drugs. Do so just long enough to succeed and then get off them - there will be no bad side effects and all the positive effects will continue after you stop using them.\n\n-The script reeks of rewrites. \"Guys. This bit of the movie is flabby. Drop in a fight scene here.\"\n\n-Plot holes. Big gaping ones that the movie patches over as it goes.\n\nThat loan shark that you borrowed $200k from? The one who said he would gut you if you didn't pay him back? How about, after raking in $8m in a week you pay off your debt? No? Ok.... Ah well, I guess it's an excuse for another fight scene, logic be damned.\n\nThose people who died from using the drug? Should we worry about Bradley Cooper dying? No? He 'weaned himself off'? Oh... Never mind.\n\nFuck you, Lazy screenwriter.\n\nEDIT: Formatting\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of March 27, 2011\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of March 2011\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2011\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

But I still did so, on the off chance that he might actually have struck gold this time.\n\nAnd I must say that I was genuinely surprised with the level of entertainment that \"Naked\" turned out to be. This was definitely one of the better Marlon Wayans movies in quite some time. Now, with that said, I am not saying that this is an outstanding movie in the comedy genre, but it was a definite improvement on his past many movies.\n\nI must admit that I found it good to watch Marlon Wayans in a comedy that wasn't a spoof on other movies, so it was something new and refreshing to watch. But then again, the concept of the movie with the same time frame looping over and over, leaving the character in the movie to repeat the same events over and over have been done previously in other movies such as \"Groundhog Day\".\n\nThe story in \"Naked\" was actually a good combination of comedy and a good story arc, which made for a rather good viewing experience. It was a combination of the storyline, the characters, the events of the story and the dialogue that worked quite well together.\n\nAside from Marlon Wayans, then \"Naked\" does have some good talents on the cast list and some familiar faces if you are no newcomer to comedy. These include Regina Hall, Dennis Haysbert and Loretta Devine.\n\nIf you enjoy comedies and Marlon Wayans movies in particular, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch \"Naked\".\n\n- paul\\_haakonsen\n- Aug 12, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ15\n\n- How long is Naked?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 11, 2017 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Lễ Kết Hôn Bá Đạo\n- Filming locations\n    - Second Presbyterian Church, Charleston, South Carolina, USA(Church)\n- Production companies\n    - Baby Way Productions\n    - Wayans Alvarez Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 36 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the French language plot outline for Naked (2017)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

                "Plot Complexity": "Naked is a 1993 British black comedy drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh and starring David Thewlis as Johnny, a loquacious intellectual, philosopher and conspiracy theorist. The film won several awards, including Best Director and Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Naked marked a new career high for Leigh as a director and made the then-unknown Thewlis an internationally recognised star. In a Manchester alley, Johnny is having sex with a woman, who initially encourages him but then protests that he is hurting her, pushes him away, and runs off vowing that \"her Bernard\" will get vengeance on him for this. Johnny grabs his things from his apartment, steals a car, and flees to Dalston, a \"scrawny, unpretentious area\" in east London. He seeks refuge at the home of Louise, a former girlfriend from Manchester, who is not happy to see him. Louise works as a file clerk and lives with two flatmates, the unemployed Sophie, whom she calls her \"hippy-dippy friend\", and the primary tenant Sandra, a nurse who is away in Zimbabwe. Johnny seduces Sophie while treating Louise coldly, but soon tires of her. He leaves and walks around central London, expounding his world view at length to anyone who will listen. Among the people he meets are Archie, a young Scottish man looking for his girlfriend Maggie on Brewer Street, and Brian, a security guard who looks after an empty office building at night, which Johnny calls \"the most tedious job in England\", while planning to move to a seaside cottage in the future. After pursuing a drunk woman and rejecting her when he notices a skull and crossbones tattoo on her shoulder, Johnny follows a young cafe worker home but is thrown out when she starts crying. He hitches a ride with a man hanging posters around town until the man, exasperated by Johnny's nonstop haranguing, throws him down in the street and kicks him before driving off with Johnny's duffel bag containing his clothes and books. Johnny wanders the streets and is severely beaten by a wandering gang of thugs. He returns to Louise's residence to find that their landlord Jeremy (aka Sebastian), a psychopathic and amoral yuppie and rapist, has let himself into the apartment. Jeremy raped Sophie and dropped several hundred pounds for her 'services'. Sophie is desperate to get Jeremy out of the house, but she and Louise fear the police will not help. They try to keep the injured Johnny quiet, but he has a fit that awakens the sleeping Jeremy. Sandra returns early from her trip. Though horrified by the state of the apartment, she tends to Johnny's injuries. Louise drives Jeremy from the house by feigning interest in him but then pulling a knife on him. Feeling desolate and rejected, Sophie flees the house with her few possessions. Louise and Johnny seemingly reconcile and discuss returning to Manchester together, but once she leaves for work, Johnny steals the money and hobbles out into the streets.",

                    "Description": "The film is dark, monochromatic and claustrophobic, with subtle visual references to film noir and Alfred Hitchcock. Many shots are in stairwells and in borrowed flats whose tenants are hostile toward or unaware of the decor, making them seem disconnected from cultural touchstones and their place in their homes. Alienation, sexual violence and misogyny, addiction and depression are touched upon as Johnny meets various rootless individuals who work in dead-end jobs or are unemployed.",
                    "Reviews": "The film generated mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 89% \"fresh\" rating based on reviews from 61 critics, with an average score of 8.30/10 and the consensus: \"Naked lives up to its title with a thoroughly committed performance from David Thewlis that's backed up with some of Mike Leigh's most powerful direction.\""

The film follows a battle between an unknown \"dream terrorist\" who causes nightmares by stealing a device that allows others to share their dreams, the research psychologist Dr. Atsuko Chiba, and a personality named Paprika—a dream detective who shares Atsuko's mind.[5][6]\n\nPaprika was Kon's fourth and final feature film before his death in 2010.[5][6] His co-writer Seishi Minakami had previously written for Kon's TV series Paranoia Agent (2004),[7] while the film's character design and animation director was Masashi Ando,[8] and the music was composed by Kon's frequent collaborator Susumu Hirasawa.[8] The art director was Nobutaka Ike, who worked on all of Kon's projects.[9] \nJapanese animation studio Madhouse animated and produced the film.\n\nThe film had its worldwide premiere at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Lion.[10] It was released in Japan on November 25, 2006, and received critical acclaim.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the near future, a newly created device called the DC Mini allows users to view people's dreams. The head of the team working on this treatment, Dr. Atsuko Chiba, begins using the machine illegally to help psychiatric patients outside the research facility by assuming her dream world alter-ego, a detective named Paprika. Atsuko's closest allies are Dr. Toratarō Shima, the chief of the department, and Dr. Kōsaku Tokita, the inventor of the DC Mini.\n\nPaprika counsels a detective named Toshimi Konakawa, who is plagued by a recurring dream regarding an unknown former colleague and a victim in a homicide case he is investigating. She gives Toshimi a card with the name of a website on it, which leads him into a bar where he is able to meet Paprika, who compares the Internet to dreams. In a meeting with the company chairman, Dr. Seijirō Inui, to discuss the theft of three DC Mini prototypes, Toratarō goes on a nonsensical tirade and jumps through a window, nearly killing himself. Upon examining Toratarō's dream, which is a parade of random objects, Kōsaku recognizes his assistant, Kei Himuro, which confirms their suspicion that the theft was an inside job.\n\nWhile investigating Himuro's home, Atsuko ignores the warnings that Paprika gives her, and accidentally slips into a dream space, which, due to her frequent use of the DC Mini, can now affect her constantly. Atsuko almost dies, after ignoring another warning by Paprika, but is rescued by her co-investigators.\n\nWhen two other scientists fall victim to the DC Mini, Seijirō bans the use of the device. This fails to hinder the crazed parade, now inside Himuro's dream, which claims Kōsaku. Paprika and Toratarō discover that Himuro is only an empty shell. The real culprit is Seijirō, who believes that he must protect dreams from humankind's influence through dream therapy, with the help of Dr. Morio Osanai. Investigating the demise of the two scientists, Toshimi meets with Atsuko, Toratarō, and Kōsaku. Leaving the meeting, he has an anxiety attack. In an emergency session with Paprika, she reveals the scenes in his dreams each correspond to genres of movies. The parade bursts into Toshimi's dream, prompting Paprika to leave the session to help Kōsaku in Himuro's dream.\n\nPaprika is captured by Seijirō and Morio, who obsessively confesses his love for Atsuko and peels away Paprika's skin to reveal Atsuko underneath. However, he is interrupted by the outraged Seijirō, who demands that they finish off Atsuko. Meanwhile in his dream at the bar, Toshimi learns his recurring dream is based in anxiety over the illness and death of his colleague from his youth whose memory he'd repressed, with whom he aspired to be a film director. Resolving his anxieties, Toshimi finds and enters Himuro's dream and flees with Atsuko back into his own dream. Morio gives chase, which ends in Toshimi shooting Morio. The act kills Morio's physical body in the real world.\n\nDreams and reality begin to merge. The dream parade runs amok in the city, and reality starts to unravel. Toratarō is nearly killed by a giant doll, but is saved by Paprika, who now appears as a fully separate entity from Atsuko. Amidst the chaos, Kōsaku, in the form of a giant robot, eats Atsuko and prepares to do the same to Paprika. A ghostly apparition of Atsuko appears and reveals that she is in love with Kōsaku and has been repressing these emotions. She comes to terms with her repressed desires, reconciling herself with the part of her that is Paprika. Seijirō, in a megalomaniacal delirium, returns in the form of a giant humanoid nightmare and threatens to darken the world with his delusions. Paprika throws herself into Kōsaku's body. A baby emerges from the robotic shell and consumes Seijirō, aging into a fully-grown combination of Atsuko and Paprika as she does so, then fades away, ending the nightmare.\n\nIn the real world, Atsuko sits at Kōsaku's bedside as he wakes up. Toshimi later visits the website from Paprika's card and receives a message from Paprika, telling him that Atsuko will change her surname to Kōsaku's surname Tokita and suggesting the film Dreaming Kids to him. He enters a cinema and purchases a ticket for Dreaming Kids.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Megumi Hayashibara as Dr. Atsuko Chiba (千葉 敦子博士, Chiba Atsuko-hakase), an attractive and modest psychiatrist and researcher at the Institute for Psychiatric Research.

It was composed by Susumu Hirasawa. A bonus movie was included with the CD.\n\nThe soundtrack is notable for being one of the first film scores to use Vocaloid (Lola as the \"voicebank\") for vocals.[11][12] It's also the last of Hirasawa's albums where an Amiga computer was used for composition. All MIDI was sequenced through an Amiga 4000 running the Bars n Pipes program.\n\n## Production\n\nDue to the small scale of release, both Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers had a hard time recouping their investment funds. However, Kon's name had become known among the film industry by the time of the Paprika project, and his reputation had already been established, so the film was produced.[13][14]\n\nAfter finishing his first film, Perfect Blue, Kon was planning to make his next film, Paprika, with the producer of the company that financed it, but the project was ruined when the company, Rex Entertainment, went bankrupt.[15] However, the idea of Paprika was in Kon's mind as early as 1998, and his attempts to depict the ambiguities and shaky boundaries between \"illusion and reality\" and \"memory and reality\" in his directorial debut Perfect Blue and his original film Millennium Actress were actually because he wanted to visually portray a dynamic like the novel Paprika.[1][15][16]\n\nLater, when he met with the author, Yasutaka Tsutsui, and received his permission to make the film, Kon stated that he felt as if he had realized what he had always imagined.[15]\n\nUnlike Perfect Blue, which was also based on a novel, Kon didn't change the fundamental parts of the original in Paprika, but he did change some parts of the novel to fit the movie. For two reasons, Kon thought that the original could not be adapted into a movie. One reason was that the novel Paprika was too voluminous to fit into a single film, and the other reason was that over ten years had already passed since the novel was published, and many creators had already embodied the ideas inspired by Paprika in various media, not just in films.[1][17] Therefore, Kon decided to first make the original into a simple form, and then incorporate ideas from the original as well as from Tsutsui's other works into the frame.[1] Kon believed that the charm of the original lay in the dream scenes, and that the film would only be complete if the dream world was portrayed in rich detail with expressions that he believed only visual images could provide.[17] The descriptions of dreams in the novel were supplemented by explanations in the text. However, in the case of visual works, which show the images of dreams flowing one after another, explanation would hinder the flow.[1][17]\n\nIn order to create a glamorous image for the entire film, and still devote enough time to portraying the dream scenes without introducing the characters, Kon, in contrast to the previous film, used voice actors who were well known for their voice acting and whom he deemed to fit the characters' image.[17]\n\nThe budget was approximately 300 million yen, and the production took about two and a half years from planning to completion.[1]\n\n## Themes\n\nLike Kon's other works, this film uses the motif of \"fiction and reality\" to depict a world in which seamlessly connected dreams and reality are violently switched, and the boundary between fiction and reality becomes indistinct, in a uniquely realistic manner.[18][19]\n\nFor Kon, \"fiction\" and \"reality\" are not opposing concepts, but both are homogeneous in the sense that they are both \"painted things,\" and the only thing that separates the two is \"what is drawn there.\"[20]\nKon rarely traced real scenes when he drew, and he wanted his pictures to be more abstract than realistic, so that they would \"look like that.\"[20]\nIn other words, the screen full of reality that the audience feels as if it is real is just a \"picture\" for Kon, and because it is animation, there is essentially no distinction between reality and fiction in its expression.[20]\nThis gap is what gives birth to the \"tricks\" that support Satoshi Kon's works.[20]\nThe relationship between \"fiction and reality\" in Kon's work is that real pictures that make you forget that they are pictures are \"reality\" first, and then arrange them in the same position as reality and fiction in the form of \"actually this was a picture (fiction)\", and it is an illusion unique to anime.[20]\nHowever, what makes this work different from Kon's other works is that it has a deeper relationship between \"dream\" and \"reality,\" where \"dream\" and \"reality\" are each transformed into the existence of the other.[20]\nIn the film, the \"dream\" is represented as a \"distorted reality reflecting the unconscious desires of the dreamer,\" and the trick is to transform the \"reality\" into the \"dream\" by adding distortions at the level of the picture, and the \"dream\" into the \"reality\" by correcting the distortions.[20]\n\nIn this film, Kon's core theme is the duality, multifacetedness, contrast, and the balance between them, which he intentionally incorporated into the film from the beginning.[21]\nThe relationship between Atsuko and Paprika is one of contrast and duality within the same person, but the characterization and arrangement of the other characters follows the same idea.[21]\n\nThe parade of inanimate \"nightmares\" depicted in the film is not found in the novel, and was entirely Kon's idea.[1][15]\nWith the time limitation of the film, it was difficult to portray various dreams in different ways as in the original, so Kon decided to focus on a dream image that would be symbolic throughout the film and that would be instantly recognizable as a nightmare when it appeared.[1]\nAccording to Kon, the parade scene was something that he and Susumu Hirasawa, who produced the music, created together.[22]\n\n## Release\n\n### Festivals\n\nPaprika premiered on 2 September 2006, at the 63rd Venice Film Festival.[23][24] It screened at the 44th New York Film Festival, playing on 7 October 2006. It competed at the 19th Tokyo International Film Festival 21–29 October 2006, as the opening screening for the 2006 TIFF Animation CG Festival.[25] It also competed in 27th Fantasporto from 23 February to 3 March 2007. Paprika was shown at the 2007 National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C., as the closing film of the Anime Marathon at the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian, and at the 2007 Greater Philadelphia Cherry Blossom Festival. It played at the Sarasota Film Festival on 21 April 2007, in Sarasota, Florida. Additionally, it was shown at the 39th International Film Festival in Auckland, New Zealand, on 22 July 2007, and was shown as the festival travelled around New Zealand.\n\n### Distribution\n\nPaprika was distributed in Japan by Sony Pictures Entertainment Japan, the same company that distributed the previous film Tokyo Godfathers, and ran from November 25, 2006 until March 2007.[14][13]\nThe film was first released in November in three limited theaters in Kantō region, and it drew a total of 2,210 people and grossed 3,460,500 yen ($30,000 at the exchange rate at the time) on its first two days, and a total of 71,236 people and 100 million yen ($870,000) in January of the following year, the eighth week of its release.[26][27]\n\nIn the United States, the film received a limited release on May 24, 2007, with Sony Pictures Classics distributing the film.[14]\nIt was initially released in only two theaters, in New York City and Los Angeles, but was gradually expanded to show on up to 37 screens simultaneously.[28]\nHowever, the total number of theaters far exceeded that, eventually reaching over 80.[28][29]\nIt was rare for Japanese anime to be released theatrically in the U.S. and, up until the 2010s when wider anime releases slowly started to become more common, were largely confined to a very small handful of arthouse theaters, so for the standards at the time, the scale of over 80 theaters was quite large for an anime release in America.[29][a]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $882,267 in the United States.[b] \nIn other territories, the film grossed $62,648 in Singapore, Italy and South Korea as of 2007[update], for an overseas total of $944,915 outside of Japan.[30]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 94 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10 and the consensus reading: \"Following its own brand of logic, Paprika is an eye-opening mind trip that is difficult to follow but never fails to dazzle.\"[31] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 26 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[32] Paprika won the Best Feature Length Theatrical Anime Award at the sixth-annual Tokyo Anime Awards during the 2007 Tokyo International Anime Fair.[33]\n\nAndrez Bergen of Yomiuri Shimbun praised Paprika as the \"most mesmerizing animation long-player since Miyazaki's Spirited Away five years ago\" (in 2001). He also praised the film's animation and backgrounds.[34] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave it a positive review, saying that the film is a \"sophisticated work of the imagination\" and \"challenging and disturbing and uncanny in the ways it captures the nature of dreams\". LaSalle later went on to say that the film is a \"unique and superior achievement.\"[35] Rob Nelson of The Village Voice praised the film for its visuals. However, he complained about the plot, saying that Paprika is not \"a movie that's meant to be understood so much as simply experienced - or maybe dreamed.\" Nelson later went on to say that Kon \"maintains a charming faith in cinema's ability to seduce fearless new (theater) audiences, even one viewer at a time.\"[36] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that the film has a \"sense of unease about the rapidly changing relationship between our physical selves and our machines.\" Dargis praised Kon for his direction, saying that he \"shows us the dark side of the imaginative world in Paprika that he himself has perceptively brightened.\"[37] Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies said that Paprika \"proves once again that the great science fiction doesn't rely on giant robots and alien worlds\".[38]\n\nConversely, Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review, saying: \"With a conventional invade-dreams/bend-reality plot, it's a bit of a bore. It's not as dreamlike and mesmerizing as Richard Linklater's rotoscope-animation Waking Life, less fanciful than the Oscar-winning anime Spirited Away.\"[39] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle said the film \"is as trippy as a Jefferson Airplane light show\" and criticized the characters and the dialogue.[40]\n\nThe Lord of the Rings and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind actor Elijah Wood praised the film in an interview,[41] Time included it in its top 25 animated films of all time,[42] while Time Out also included the film in its list of top 50 animated films of all time.[43] Rotten Tomatoes included it in its list of fifty best animated films of all time.[44] Newsweek Japan included Paprika in its list of the 100 best films of all time, while the American edition of Newsweek included it among its top twenty films of 2007.[45] Metacritic has listed the film among the top 25 highest-rated science fiction films of all time,[46] and the top 30 highest-rated animations of all time.[47]\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nPaprika received the following awards and nominations:[48]\n\n|   Year  | Award                              | Category                                 | Recipient    | Result    |\n|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|\n|   2006  | Montréal Festival of New Cinema    | Public's Choice Award                    | Satoshi Kon  | Won       |\n|   2006  | Venice Film Festival               | Golden Lion (Best Film)                  | Satoshi Kon  | Nominated |\n|   2007  | Fantasporto                        | Critics Choice Award (Prêmio da Crítica) | Satoshi Kon  | Won       |\n|   2007  | Newport Beach Film Festival        | Feature Film Award for Best Animation    | Satoshi Kon  | Won       |\n|   2007  | Online Film Critics Society Awards | Best Animated Film                       | Satoshi Kon  | Nominated |\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Live-action adaptation\n\nA live-action adaptation of Paprika, to be directed by Wolfgang Petersen, was in development in 2009.[49][50] However, since then, there has not been any significant update to whether it will be produced. In August 2022, it was reported that Cathy Yan would direct and executive produce a live-action television adaptation for Amazon Studios.[51]\n\n### Inception\n\nCritics have suggested that director Christopher Nolan took influence from Paprika for his 2010 film Inception.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeveral critics and scholars have noted many striking similarities that later appeared in the 2010 Christopher Nolan film Inception, including plot similarities, similar scenes, and similar characters, arguing that Inception was influenced by Paprika.[52][53][54][55] Ciara Wardlow of Film School Rejects argues that Inception was influenced by Paprika based on similarities too numerous to be coincidence, from \"the focus on dream sharing technology to Ariadne’s wardrobe to references to Greek mythology, physics-defying hallways, significant dream-elevators, and the choice of having a Japanese businessman (Saito) be the one to hire Cobb and the dream team, among other things\".[53] Patrick Drazen said at least \"one scene is a clean and undeniable link: in the climactic dream sequence, when Paprika is trying to escape the chairman and his helper, she defies gravity by running across the wall instead of the floor.\"[52] Julian Rizzo-Smith of IGN claims that \"Nolan drew upon famous scenery of Paprika\", noting striking similarities such as \"the ever-stretching long hallway where Toshimi witnesses a murder, and the visual effect of the dream world shattering like glass.\"[54] Joshua Horner of WhatCulture claims that \"Nolan was inspired by Paprika\", and adds that there are strikingly similar scenes where Paprika and Ariadne both \"enter an elevator with each floor representing another layer of the host's subconscious.\"[55]\n\nAlistair Swale, while uncertain whether Nolan \"appropriated elements of Paprika directly\", notes striking similarities between them, such as both exploring similar themes of \"computer technology enabling people to enter the realm of the subconscious and experience time on multiple levels\", and notes their similarities are comparable to that which exists between Ghost in the Shell and The Matrix.[56] Steven Boone of Politico said he suspects Paprika \"was on Nolan's list of homages\", and compares it favourably with Inception, arguing that \"Kon confronts his tormented society with visual poetry, not just a remix of tropes and set pieces\" and that Paprika \"goes deep, where Inception just talks of depth and darkness but, as a screen experience, sticks with glib pyrotechnics\".[57][58] French film site Excessif claimed in 2010 that Nolan cited Paprika as an influence on Elliot Page's character Ariadne in the film,[59][60] a claim repeated by Phil de Semlyen of Empire,[61] but Film School Rejects and Anime News Network note that no direct quote from Nolan was given to support this claim.[53][60]\n\n## See also\n\n- Anime and manga portal\n- Speculative fiction portal\n\n- False awakening\n- Lucid dream\n- The Lathe of Heaven\n\n## Notes and references\n\n### Notes\n\n- ^ Kon's previous film Millennium Actress (2001) was released in 6 theaters, Tokyo Godfathers (2003) in 10, and the same Japanese anime films Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004) in 55 and Steamboy (2005) in 39.[29]\n- ^ At the time, this was the 12th Japanese theatrical anime to earn over 100 million yen at the box office in the U.S., the first time in two years since Howl's Moving Castle in 2005, and the only two R-rated theatrical anime for adults were this film and Cowboy Bebop: Heaven's Door, released in 2003.[28]\n\n### References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f g h \"Interview 17 2007年4月アメリカから『パプリカ』に関するインタビュー\".

It is based on the 1993 novel of the same name by Yasutaka Tsutsui. The Japanese voice cast stars Megumi Hayashibara, Tōru Emori, Katsunosuke Hori, Tōru Furuya, Akio Ōtsuka, Kōichi Yamadera, and Hideyuki Tanaka. The film follows a battle between an unknown \"dream terrorist\" who causes nightmares by stealing a device that allows others to share their dreams, the research psychologist Dr. Atsuko Chiba, and a personality named Paprika—a dream detective who shares Atsuko's mind.\n    </Plot>\n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Megumi Hayashibara as Dr. Atsuko Chiba</Actor>\n        <Actor>Tōru Furuya as Dr. Kōsaku Tokita</Actor>\n        <Actor>Tōru Emori as Dr. Seijirō Inui</Actor>\n        <Actor>Katsunosuke Hori as Dr. Toratarō Shima</Actor>\n        <Actor>Akio Ōtsuka as Detective Toshimi Konakawa</Actor>\n        <Actor>Kōichi Yamadera as Dr. Morio Osanai</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    <Music>\n        The soundtrack was released on 23 November 2006 under the TESLAKITE label.

Loosely based on the lives of actresses Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine,[3] it tells the story of two documentary filmmakers investigating the life of a retired acting legend. As she tells them the story of her life, the borderline between cinema and reality gradually becomes blurred.[4]\n\n## Plot\n\nThe story references Japanese films including Throne of Blood and the original Godzilla (pictured).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChiyoko Fujiwara, a renowned former actress and prominent star for film company Ginei, accepts a request for a retrospective interview amidst the demolition of the company's obsolete studio, her first interview in thirty years after her sudden retirement from the entertainment industry. Documentarian Genya Tachibana, a fan of Chiyoko, visits her house with his cameraman Kyoji Ida. Genya gives Chiyoko a small box containing an old-fashioned key. She remarks that the key \"opens the most important thing\" and begins reflecting on her life.\n\nChiyoko was born during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which took the life of her father. As a schoolgirl, she is scouted by Ginei's general manager to appear in a government-sponsored film to inspire troops serving in the Second Sino-Japanese War. While her mother opposes, intending for Chiyoko to inherit the family's confectionery store, Chiyoko remains uncertain. She meets a political dissident painter being pursued by police and hides him in her home's storehouse. The next day, he leaves for Manchuria to join his allies, leaving Chiyoko the key to his box of art supplies. Chiyoko fails to catch him before his train departs, but vows to reunite with him. Genya tearfully recognizes this as a scene from one of Chiyoko's films; from this point forward, Chiyoko's memories and films become intertwined.\n\nRecalling that Ginei's film is set in Manchuria, Chiyoko becomes an actress and travels there in the hopes of reuniting with the artist. She meets the general manager's nephew, aspiring director Junichi Ōtaki, and Ginei's lead actress, Eiko Shimao. During filming, Chiyoko is led to northern Manchuria by a fortuneteller bribed by Eiko. Her train is attacked by bandits before the setting shifts to a burning Sengoku period castle - Chiyoko, in the role of a princess, is tricked by an old wraith into drinking a cursed tea that will cause her to \"burn forever in the flames of eternal love\". In Chiyoko's continuing search for the artist, the setting and Chiyoko's role changes in quick succession, ranging from a courtesan in a brothel at the end of the Edo period to a schoolgirl in the Taishō era. Her family's store is destroyed in an air raid, but on a surviving wall, she finds a portrait of her painted by the artist and a promise of their reunion.\n\nAfter World War II, Chiyoko's career flourishes, but she never forgets the artist. One day during filming, Eiko secretly steals the key. When asked by the film crew about the significance of the key, Chiyoko despondently realizes that she can no longer remember the artist's face, and resigns herself to a married life with Junichi. She eventually finds the key hidden in their home and confronts Junichi about it; Junichi, having been aware of Eiko's role in the fortuneteller incident, coerced her into stealing the key on his behalf in order to secure Chiyoko's hand in marriage. Eiko admits to being motivated by jealousy toward Chiyoko's youth and innocence. An old, scarred man who had pursued the artist as a military policeman approaches Chiyoko on a journey of atonement and hands her a letter from the artist. Chiyoko boards an express train to the artist's hometown in Hokkaido, but the conclusion of her trek proves fruitless.\n\nDuring production of Chiyoko's final film, an earthquake causes the set to collapse. A young Genya, working as an assistant at the time, rescues her. Seeing the wraith in her prop helmet, Chiyoko flees the set and retires from acting. In the present day, Chiyoko, once more seeing the wraith in her reflection, acknowledges that she is no longer the girl the artist had met. Upon the end of the interview, another earthquake strikes, upsetting Chiyoko's fragile health. En route to the hospital, Genya confides to Kyoji that after Chiyoko left for Hokkaido, the policeman confessed to him that he tortured the artist to death. On her deathbed, Chiyoko thanks Genya for rekindling her memories of the artist and reviving the young girl she was before. She concludes that it does not matter if she sees the artist again or not, because what she really loved was the search for him.\n\n## Cast\n\n| Character

Actress is the second film directed by Satoshi Kon and his first original work, after the highly acclaimed Perfect Blue.[5][6]\nIt was planned by Masao Maruyama and produced by Taro Maki.[7] The film is partly based on the life of Japanese actress Setsuko Hara, although it was produced and released more than a decade prior to her death.[8]\n\nFollowing the release of Perfect Blue, Kon considered adapting the Yasutaka Tsutsui novel Paprika (1993) into his next film. \nHowever, these plans were stalled when the distribution company for Perfect Blue, Rex Entertainment, went bankrupt.[9]\n\nThe project for Millennium Actress came from the words \"Let's make a movie that looks like a trompe l'oeil\" by Taro Maki, who decided to produce Kon's film because he thought his previous work was amazing.[5][10]\nThe script writing began with a sentence that Kon came up with: \"An old woman who was once touted as a great actress is supposed to be recounting her life story, but her memories get confused and the various roles she played in the past begin to blend into it, creating a tumultuous story.\"[6]\nThe structure of the story was decided at the rough plot stage when Kon fleshed out this sentence, and the last scene remained intact in the finished film.[6]\nHe then worked with the scenario writer, Sadayuki Murai, and the producer to develop the episodes and detailed character settings to be included in the plot.[11]\n\nUnlike the previous film, which he was hired to direct, this one was his original project, so he was able to express his own opinions, and decided to put more emphasis on the sound, especially the music, and asked Susumu Hirasawa, who had been adored for a long time, to compose the music.[12]\nThere were about 250 staff members in total, and the production period was about two years. The 20 or so main staff members were almost the same as in the previous work, with only the animation director changing.[11]\nIn the previous work, the character design was done by Hisashi Eguchi and the animation director by Hideki Hamasu, but in this work, both were done by Takeshi Honda.[12]\nThe reason for this is that the animation director is a very important and burdensome position, and the animators who have the skills and abilities that Kon would like to work with are usually those prefer to draw key frames rather than the animation director, making it difficult to ask them to continue their work.[12]\nFor the character designs, Honda was chosen because he is someone who draws elegant pictures that can appeal to those outside of the animation community and is genuinely talented in the animation industry, in order to make sure that the movie would have reach audiences both within and outside the spectrum of animation fandom.[12]\nSome of the character designs were done by Kon himself, and all the posters of Chiyoko in the movie were also drawn by Kon.[13]\n\nThis is Kon's last movie to utilize cel animation, as his later works were produced using digital ink-and-paint among other digital methods. And most of the scenes are drawn based on Kon's layout.[13]\n\nThe budget was initially 130 million yen, and the final budget was around 100 million and a few tens of millions of yen, one of the lowest production costs for an animated film in Japan.[14]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was released in North America on September 12, 2003, distributed by DreamWorks' arthouse and foreign movie publishing company Go Fish Pictures, with a total of six screens.[15]\n\nTheatrical anime distribution company Eleven Arts acquired the North American rights and re-released the film theatrically in its original Japanese language version on August 13, 2019, and in an all-new English dubbed version on August 19, 2019.[16]\n\n### Box office\n\nCommercially, the film performed modestly on its US release earning $18,732[17] on its opening weekend and $37,285 during its full three-week release. The film was shown almost exclusively in New York and Los Angeles and received a minimal advertising campaign from Go Fish Pictures, a division of DreamWorks SKG.\nAlthough the scale of the release was not large, the merit of the theatrical release was not only in the box-office revenue, but also in the fact that critics would view the film and publish reviews and criticisms in general newspapers, magazines and websites, which would raise awareness of the work and reach an audience outside of the hardcore anime fandom.[15]\n\n## Themes\n\nMillennium Actress began with a request to make a trompe l'oeil movie like the previous Perfect Blue. However, it was only a film technique, not a film theme. Both works share the same methodology of \"blurring the boundary between fiction and reality,\" and both works are like two sides of the same coin for Kon.[12][18]\nThe previous film focused on the negative side of human nature, while this film focuses on the positive side.[18]\nThe previous film depicted the gradual blurring of the boundary between fiction and reality, while this film seamlessly connects fiction and reality from the beginning, and shows the characters freely moving back and forth between fiction and reality.[5]\nThe technique of mixing fiction and reality was used to express the protagonist's uneasy inner world in the previous film, and used in this film for a fun adventure, turning the film from psycho-horror and suspense to a tricky and humorous entertainment.[19][20]\n\nIn the previous film, he tried to confuse the audience by depicting the inner turmoil and chaos of the main character through the mixture of fiction and reality, but in this film, his intention is not to confuse the audience, but to let the audience enjoy the mixture of fiction and reality itself.[12]\nHe aimed to create a film a kind of The Adventures of Old Lady Blowing Smoke by mixing fiction and reality to the point where it becomes meaningless to distinguish between them.[12]\n\nThere are various kinds of trompe l'oeil paintings, but one example that Kon gave to the staff was Utagawa Kuniyoshi's ukiyoe \"At first glance he looks very fierce, but he is actually a kind person\" (みかけハこハゐがとんだいゝ人だ). At first glance, it appears to be the face of a single person, but upon closer inspection, one can see that many people are intertwined, and he likened this characteristic of the painting, \"non-faces coming together to form a face,\" to the concept of this work, \"lies piling up to reveal the truth.[5]\n\nThe film has a complex structure in which the staff members who visit the legendary actress for an interview experience her life story in a fictional world where the actress' past and the movies she appeared in intersect, making the story a mixture of reality and fiction as well as a tribute to various classic movies.[21]\nThe main character is modeled on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, and the movies that appear in the film include a period piece in the style of Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood, a film by Yasujiro Ozu, a chanbara (sword fighting) story featuring Kurama Tengu, a monster story that borrows images from Godzilla, and a science fiction story.[20][22]\n\nThe story follows the personal story of Chiyoko Fujiwara, an elderly actress, and gradually becomes a muddle of reality, dreams, and movies. Each episode repeats a series of scenes of \"chasing, running, and falling\" in different situations and times. Her life, the sum of all of these, also repeats various setbacks and revivals while continuing to chase after Man with Key, who is almost an illusion.[23]\nThis work is basically a repetition of the same episode, a cyclical story like Boléro in music.[6]\nKon said that this idea of a fractal structure owes a lot to the music of Susumu Hirasawa.[23]\nThe story also reflects the hospitalization Kon experienced after his debut as a manga artist, and the frustration and struggle he felt at that time: \"Everything is ruined, but can I still make a comeback?\"[23]\nThis film is famous for making many audiences feel betrayed by Chiyoko's last line. Kon said that the process of human growth is a repetition of death and rebirth, in which the values we have accumulated up to that point become unacceptable in a new phase, and even if we rebuild them once they are broken, they become unacceptable again in a new phase, and he involved the audience in the fractal of the film by asking them whether they would be able to get up and continue to \"chase, run, and fall\" even after they \"fell\" at the end of the film.[14][23]\n\nKon said, \"There is no single solution - that's what I want most for my work to be. I want people to see it in many different ways.\"[20]\n\n## Critical reception\n\nMillennium Actress was favorably received by critics, gaining a 93% \"fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[24] Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan said of the film \"as a rumination on the place movies have in our personal and collective subconscious, Millennium Actress fascinatingly goes where films have not often gone before\".[25] Kevin M. Williams of the Chicago Tribune gave the movie 4 stars and put his feelings for the film this way: \"A piece of cinematic art. It's modern day Japanese animation at its best [...] It's animated, but it's human and will touch the soul of anyone who has loved deeply\".[26] In February 2004, Cinefantastique listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", stating that it \"represents a new maturity for anime, one where the technical achievements of 40 years are finally put at the full service of an emotionally rich story.\"[27]\n\n### Awards\n\nMillennium Actress received the Grand Prize in the Japan Agency of Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festival,[28] tying with Spirited Away. Additionally, it won the awards of Best Animation Film and Fantasia Ground-Breaker at the 2001 Fantasia Film Festival. It was awarded the Feature Film Award at the 8th Animation Kobe. The movie took home the prestigious Ofuji Noburo Award at the 2002 Mainichi Film Awards, and was honored with the Orient Express Award at the 2001 Festival de Cine de Sitges in Spain. The film was nominated for four Annie Awards in 2004, including Outstanding Direction and Writing. It was also promoted by its studio as a contender for the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but it was not nominated.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Interview Satoshi Kon\" (in French).

Documentarian Genya Tachibana, a fan of Chiyoko, visits her house with his cameraman Kyoji Ida. Genya gives Chiyoko a small box containing an old-fashioned key. She remarks that the key \"opens the most important thing\" and begins reflecting on her life.\n\n        Chiyoko was born during the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which took the life of her father. As a schoolgirl, she is scouted by Ginei's general manager to appear in a government-sponsored film to inspire troops serving in the Second Sino-Japanese War. While her mother opposes, intending for Chiyoko to inherit the family's confectionery store, Chiyoko remains uncertain. She meets a political dissident painter being pursued by police and hides him in her home's storehouse. The next day, he leaves for Manchuria to join his allies, leaving Chiyoko the key to his box of art supplies. Chiyoko fails to catch him before his train departs, but vows to reunite with him. Genya tearfully recognizes this as a scene from one of Chiyoko's films; from this point forward, Chiyoko's memories and films become intertwined.\n\n        Recapping that Ginei's film is set in Manchuria, Chiyoko becomes an actress and travels there in the hopes of reuniting with the artist. She meets the general manager's nephew, aspiring director Junichi Ōtaki, and Ginei's lead actress, Eiko Shimao. During filming, Chiyoko is led to northern Manchuria by a fortuneteller bribed by Eiko. Her train is attacked by bandits before the setting shifts to a burning Sengoku period castle - Chiyoko, in the role of a princess, is tricked by an old wraith into drinking a cursed tea that will cause her to \"burn forever in the flames of eternal love\". In Chiyoko's continuing search for the artist, the setting and Chiyoko's role changes in quick succession, ranging from a courtesan in a brothel at the end of the Edo period to a schoolgirl in the Taishō era. Her family's store is destroyed in an air raid, but on a surviving wall, she finds a portrait of her painted by the artist and a promise of their reunion.\n\n        After World War II, Chiyoko's career flourishes, but she never forgets the artist. One day during filming, Eiko secretly steals the key. When asked by the film crew about the significance of the key, Chiyoko despondently realizes that she can no longer remember the artist's face, and resigns herself to a married life with Junichi. She eventually finds the key hidden in their home and confronts Junichi about it; Junichi, having been aware of Eiko's role in the fortuneteller incident, coerced her into stealing the key on his behalf in order to secure Chiyoko's hand in marriage. Eiko admits to being motivated by jealousy toward Chiyoko's youth and innocence. An old, scarred man who had pursued the artist as a military policeman approaches Chiyoko on a journey of atonement and hands her a letter from the artist. Chiyoko boards an express train to the artist's hometown in Hokkaido, but the conclusion of her trek proves fruitless.\n\n        During production of Chiyoko's final film, an earthquake causes the set to collapse. A young Genya, working as an assistant at the time, rescues her. Seeing the wraith in her prop helmet, Chiyoko flees the set and retires from acting. In the present day, Chiyoko, once more seeing the wraith in her reflection, acknowledges that she is no longer the girl the artist had met. Upon the end of the interview, another earthquake strikes, upsetting Chiyoko's fragile health. En route to the hospital, Genya confides to Kyoji that after Chiyoko left for Hokkaido, the policeman confessed to him that he tortured the artist to death.

He sent Hopkins the script in 2017 and waited for a reply. In the meantime, he did not pursue production with any other actors in the lead role. He said if Hopkins had not agreed to the film, then it likely would have been made in French instead.\n\n- QuotesAnthony: Who exactly am I?\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in CBC News: Toronto: Episode dated 18 September 2020 (2020)\n\n- SoundtracksCold Wind Var. 1 - Day 1\nMusic by Ludovico Einaudi\nPiano: Ludovico Einaudi\nViolin/Viola: Federico Mecozzi\nCello: Redi Hasa\n\n### User reviews1.1K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### This movie will haunt me for awhile.\n\nIt's just so sad and also a bit terrifying.

Throughout much of the movie I kept thinking \"I know exactly where this is going,\" but it didn't go like that. It's not a great movie, but I thought that it was worth seeing. I saw a connection to Villeneuve's \"Incendies\", in which the son and daughter of an immigrant from an unidentified Arab country try to find out their family history and get an unpleasant surprise (I viewed the movie as a look at the roots of Arab Spring). The less said about Villeneuve's disgusting \"Prisoners\", the better.\n\nSo while it's not a masterpiece, it's still a fun, mind-bending movie. I've never read any of José Saramago's work but now I'd like to. Jake Gyllenhaal and Mélanie Laurent (Shoshana Dreyfuss in \"Inglourious Basterds\") have been making a lot of good movies.\n\n- lee\\_eisenberg\n- Aug 10, 2014\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ1\n\n- Where does the movie take place?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - March 14, 2014 (Canada)\n- Countries of origin\n    - Canada\n    - Spain\n    - France\n- Official sites\n    - Alfa Pictures (Spain)\n    - Official Facebook\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Enemigos idénticos\n- Filming locations\n    - Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n- Production companies\n    - Pathé\n    - Entertainment One\n    - Rhombus Media\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $1,008,726\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $16,161\n    - Mar 16, 2014\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $3,468,224\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 31 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Enemy (2013) in Australia?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The movie contains no revelations that \nlook different the second time around, and so the editing seems merely fancy \nfootwork, or Roeg showing us that he had done this before and can do it again.\n\nOne \nother possible motive for the extremely complex editing in “Bad \nTiming” may be Roeg’s desire to camouflage the fact that his story would \nbe thin and his characters shallow if they were just seen straight through from \nbeginning to end.\n\nThe \nmovie is about a relationship between two Americans who meet in Vienna. Why \nVienna? Why not Vienna? Art Garfunkel plays a psychoanalyst and Theresa Russell \nplays a sexually uninhibited young woman who is an alcoholic and pill addict. \nGarfunkel, however, does not see her as a sick person, but as an exciting \nconquest. Although the audience can see that she’s clearly in desperate \nphysical and mental trouble, Garfunkel’s analyst takes advantage of her \nconfusion to move in and establish a sexual relationship.\n\nIt’s \nnot, mind you, that she objects to sleeping with him. Indeed, she makes the \nfirst overture at a party. It’s just that the kind of man who would sleep with \na woman in that condition (especially if his professional training equipped him \nto understand her condition) would qualify as an insect. Perhaps the blame is \nnot entirely the analyst’s: Nothing in this movie indicates that Roeg has any \nparticular understanding of the fact that his heroine is desperately ill.\n\nAnd \nthat may be where the film’s troubles begin. I suspect that this particular \nstory cannot be told straight through, from beginning to end, without dealing \nhonestly with the nature of the relationship. Since Roeg is unwilling, unable \nor unequipped to do that, he hides the relationship in a thicket of stylistic \nfireworks.\n\nHis \nfavorite editing device is to flashback repeatedly to a tracheotomy that \nRussell undergoes after nearly killing herself with an overdose. The doctors \ncut open her throat and pound on her chest and she screams and bleeds, and this \nmakes great footage for Roeg to cut to whenever his film requires an emotional \njolt and he can’t supply one.\n\nThere \nis also a “mystery” in the film, and a police inspector (Harvey \nKeitel) to shadow Garfunkel and try to solve it. The film’s most annoying \nblunder is the way it gradually unveils the solution of the mystery to us. We \nsee one version of Russell’s overdose episode, and then another and another, \neach one showing us a little more, until we find at the end that Garfunkel \n(gasp!) made love to her when he should have been calling an ambulance for her, \ninstead.\n\nThe \nmovie makes this out as near-necrophilia. I make it out as the sort of thing \nthat can happen to you if your keep on taking your chances in singles bars.\n\n“Bad \nTiming” is finally just an exercise in telling a shallow and crude story \nin a sophisticated and complicated way. Who needs it? This film has been \npraised for its honesty, but it would have taken far more honesty (not to \nmention courage) to deal with the personality disorders of these characters \ninstead of simply burying them in blood, sex, and noise. If there is any reason \nto see this film, however, it is the performance by Theresa Russell (who was \nDustin Hoffman’s lover in “Straight Time”). She is only 22 or 23, and \nyet her performance is astonishingly powerful.

Gomez, Hudgens, Benson, and Korine portray four college-aged girls who go on spring break in St. Petersburg, Florida and meet an eccentric local drug dealer (Franco) who helps them when they are desperate. They descend into a world of drugs, crime, and violence.[6][7][8][9][10]\n\nKorine had developed the concept over several years prior to production, with fleeting ideas about the plot and what should transpire. His initial desire was to create a \"sensory film\" that was more about feeling than action; he placed little importance on narrative or plot, the idea for which came later.[11] Once Korine developed the story's backbone, which takes place around the American spring break period, he traveled to Florida to write the screenplay. Production began in 2012, on an estimated budget of $5 million. It is one of Korine's first theatrical works to receive a wide release.[12]\n\nSpring Breakers was released on March 22, 2013, in the United States by A24 and grossed $31 million worldwide, making it a resounding success considering the small budget. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the acting and Debie's cinematography especially. Some described it as a potential cult classic.[13][14][15][16] The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival.[17] Critics and scholars have read deeper meaning in the plot, commenting on its reflection of modern superficiality and the younger generation's self-destructive obsession with highly stylized, disposable pop culture media and sensory ephemera.[18] A sequel, Spring Breakers: The Second Coming, is in development. Jonas Åkerlund and Irvine Welsh initially intended to direct and write, respectively. Since development was restarted Korine has been open to directing and writing the sequel.\n\n## Plot\n\nCollege students Brit, Candy, and Cotty often spend their time partying while their friend Faith attends a religious youth group. As their classmates head to spring break, they are stuck behind because they don't have the money to travel. Desperate to make the trip, Brit and Candy, get high on cocaine, don ski masks, and rob a local restaurant, using the threat of hammers and realistic-looking squirt guns. They are assisted by Cotty, who drives (and later burns) the getaway car stolen from one of their professors. Cotty, Candy, and Brit divulge the details of their crime to a horrified Faith, who keeps quiet about it.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, Florida, the girls attend wild beach parties fueled by alcohol, drugs, and sex. After a particularly wild party, all four are arrested for using narcotics. They spend the night in a holding cell, but are bailed out by Alien, a rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien charms Cotty, Candy, and Brit with his money and \"bad boy\" swagger, but Faith is extremely uncomfortable. Alien takes the girls to a local club frequented by gang members, where Faith becomes even more uneasy. Alien attempts to seduce Faith and convince her to stay with him, using equal parts menace, threats, and tenderness, but Faith leaves, begging the others to come with her. They refuse, and she returns to college alone.\n\nAlien takes the remaining girls to a strip club owned by his rival and childhood best friend, Big Arch, who warns Alien to stop selling drugs in his territory. Alien takes the girls to his mansion, where he flaunts his drug money and cache of weapons, describing his life as the \"American Dream\". Brit and Candy grab two of his guns and threaten to kill him. Aroused, Alien fellates the gun and declares that he has fallen in love with the girls, claiming that they are his soulmates.\n\nAlien arms the girls with pink ski masks and shotguns and takes them to his pool, where the girls ask him to play something inspiring on the piano. They sing Britney Spears' \"Everytime\", while a montage plays of them performing several armed robberies. While in Alien's car, they are approached by Big Arch and another member of his gang who threaten them and execute a drive-by shooting, wounding Cotty in the process. Alien promises to retaliate, but a traumatized Cotty comes to her senses and chooses to return to college. Brit and Candy stay behind and have three-way sex with Alien in his pool. The three decide to take revenge on Big Arch. In a flashforward, the two girls call home, promising to work harder and become better people.\n\nIn the present, the three take a motorboat to Big Arch's mansion. After they dock at the pier, Alien is immediately shot and killed by one of Big Arch's guards. Brit and Candy carry on, killing the rest of the members before confronting and killing Big Arch. The camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a voice-over, first heard earlier in the film, describing the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they truly are. Brit and Candy, silent and wearing pensive, ambiguous expressions, drive to college in Big Arch's Lamborghini. A final flashback shows the two girls kissing Alien's dead body before departing.\n\n## Cast\n\n- James Franco as Alien, a rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer who takes the girls under his wing.\n- Vanessa Hudgens as Candy, an irresponsible and uncaring college girl and Brit's best friend.\n- Selena Gomez as Faith, who tries to devote her life to Christianity but is also friends with party girls Brit, Candy and Cotty.\n- Ashley Benson as Brit, a rebellious and danger-seeking college girl, also Candy's best friend.\n- Rachel Korine as Cotty, a girl who likes to party but is more careful than her friends Candy and Brit.\n- Gucci Mane as Archie \"Big Arch\", Alien's childhood best friend who has become a rival drug dealer.\n\nAdditionally, Heather Morris, Ash Lendzion, and Emma Holzer appear as Faith's friends Bess, Forest, and Heather. Jeff Jarrett portrays a youth pastor and Russell Stuart appears as a DJ.\n\n## Production\n\n### Casting\n\nA part of the main cast at the film's premiere in Paris in February 2013: Rachel Korine, Ashley Benson, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to Harmony Korine, he wrote the film partially to make up for his own spring breaks. As a youth he had been fully devoted to skateboarding, and missed out on what he later saw as opportunities for hedonistic pursuits.[19] Korine has referred to the film as a \"beach noir\".[18]\n\nThe original lineup of lead actresses was announced as Emma Roberts, Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens.[20] Director Korine had purposely collected a group of well-known young actresses with a similar reputation to Roberts in Hollywood.[21] Ashley Benson was ultimately cast after Roberts dropped out. She was uncomfortable with the film's explicit sexuality.[22]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe film was shot in March and April 2012 in and around St. Petersburg, Florida. The exterior shots and some interior shots of the college that Gomez and Benson attend were filmed at New College of Florida. Dormitory and classroom shots were filmed at Ringling College of Art and Design.[19][23] Korine announced in 2013 he planned to \"remix\" the film's unused footage and alternate takes into an entirely new cut.[24]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe film score to Spring Breakers was composed by Cliff Martinez and Skrillex, marking the first scoring assignment for the latter.[25][26] Skrillex was contacted after Korine sent music supervisor Randall Poster links to the electronica artist's music on YouTube. \"I'm accustomed to being the oldest person at a gig,\" said Poster, \"but when I went to see Skrillex at Roseland this year, it was dramatic. There were a lot of kids that looked like they were 15 years old. But I loved it. I truly loved it.\"[27] Magneto Dayo released the song \"Spring Breakers\", featuring Sage Odessa, which references the film and real-life spring break experiences.[28] The soundtrack to the film was released on March 19, 2013 by Big Beat Records and Warner Music.[29][30]\n\n## Release\n\nA three-minute preview of Spring Breakers was released at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in May 2012.[citation needed] The entire film premiered at the 69th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2012.[31] The film was released in New York and Los Angeles on March 15, 2013.[32] The film was released nationwide on March 22, 2013.[33]\n\nThe film had a limited release in the U.K. on April 5, 2013.[34] The movie was also released in France on March 6, 2013 and was scheduled to be released in Australia in early March; however, it was pushed back to a release date of May 4.\n\n### Home media\n\nSpring Breakers was released digitally on June 25, 2013,[35][36] and on DVD and Blu-ray on July 9, 2013.[37]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nSpring Breakers grossed $14,124,284 in North America and $17,600,000 in other countries for a worldwide total of $31,724,284.[4] In North America, the film opened to #6 in its first weekend with $4,858,944, behind The Croods, Admission, The Call, Oz the Great and Powerful, and Olympus Has Fallen.[38]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe performance of James Franco earned praise from critics. A24 started a campaign to support him for a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 199 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Spring Breakers blends stinging social commentary with bikini cheesecake and a bravura James Franco performance.\"[39] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating from film critics, it received a rating score of 63 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[40]\n\nXan Brooks of The Guardian said the film is Korine's \"most fully realised, purely satisfying feature film since Gummo.\"[41] Emma Seligman of The Huffington Post described the film as \"Scarface meets Britney Spears.\"[42] Oliver Lyttlelton of IndieWire gave the film a B, stating that the film would be a future cult favorite for \"midnight moviegoers\".[13]\n\nGuy Lodge of Variety gave it a negative review, saying, \"this attractively fizzy pic may be a shock to the system for fans of teen queens Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens, but remains pretty toothless titillation by its writer-helmer's standards.\"[43] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter noted that James Franco gives one of his more bizarre performances in his unpredictable career, saying \"he's a cross between Bo Derek in 10 and Richard Kiel in Moonraker.\"[44]\n\nAndrew Schenker of Slant Magazine gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.[45] Jamie Dunn of The Skinny gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying: \"If Michael Mann was to take a lot of hallucinogenics and shoot a Girls Gone Wild video, it might look something like this.\"[46] Richard Roeper of Rogerebert.com gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the character of Alien and the film's sense of humor.[47]\n\nA24 began a campaign in September 2013 in support of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for Franco's performance. This was preceded by the Hollywood.com website that produced a \"For your consideration\" poster in support of a nomination for Franco in March 2013.[48] On December 2, 2013, A24 published a YouTube video titled \"James Franco - Consider this Sh*t\" and also released print advertisements following the \"Consider this Sh*t [sic]\" theme.[49] Originally, Internet chatter considered the campaign a joke, but A24 emphasized that it was serious.[50]\n\nSpring Breakers has since appeared on various retrospective \"best of\" lists, including one honoring the best films of the 21st century. In 2016, British film magazine Little White Lies placed the film at number 40 on their list of the 50 best films of the decade (so far).[51] In August of that same year, BBC Magazine conducted a poll on the 21st century's 100 greatest films so far, with Spring Breakers ranking at number 74.[52] In France, the magazine Les Cahiers du cinéma featured Spring Breakers on their March 2013's cover,[53] and placed it second on their December 2013 Top Ten chart.[54]\n\n#### Top ten lists\n\nSpring Breakers appeared on many critics' top ten lists for 2013.[55]\n\n- Best of 2013 (not ranked) – Mark Olsen, Los Angeles Times\n- 2nd – Nigel M. Smith, Gabe Toro, &amp;amp; Katie Walsh, Indiewire[56]\n- 2nd – Cahiers du cinéma[57]\n- 4th – Ben Kenigsberg, The A.V. Club\n- 6th – David Ehrlich, Film.com\n- 6th – Gregory Ellwood, HitFix\n- 7th – Drew McWeeny, Hitfix\n- 8th – Ty Burr, The Boston Globe\n- 8th – Kristopher Tapley, HitFix\n- 8th – Marlow Stern, The Daily Beast\n- 10th – Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York\n- 10th – A.O. Scott, The New York Times\n- Best of 2013 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Manohla Dargis, The New York Times\n\n### Controversies\n\n#### Riff Raff controversy\n\nOn February 15, 2012, Korine contacted rapper Riff Raff about appearing in an upcoming film, which later developed as Spring Breakers.[58] Once the trailer was released, there was speculation that the character Alien was based on Riff Raff.[59] According to Franco, Alien is based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss, who has a cameo in the film. \"Of course, Harmony and I looked at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. I would say the biggest influence on the role was this local, Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he was down there in the place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie.\"[60]\n\nAfter much back-and-forth about the issue, Riff Raff announced in July 2013 that he was suing the creators of Spring Breakers for $10 million for \"sampling\" his life without his permission or a proper producer credit.[61] However, a September 2013 search by LA Weekly for court documents resulted in no findings.[62]\n\n#### Portrayal of women\n\nSpring Breakers has generated debate and controversy among critics, with some regarding the film as sexist due to its objectification of women, while others viewed the film as a feminist or female-empowerment film. In regard to the former perspective, The Guardian suggests that the film \"reinforces rape culture\" and \"turns young women into sex objects.\"[63] Other reviewers state that it \"pushes booze-and-bikini hedonism to the extreme,\"[64] as the \"camera glides up, down, and around these women's bodies like a giant tongue\".[65] According to Rolling Stone, the film presents \"a kind of girl-power camaraderie that could almost be called feminist,\" a result of the director's intent to \"do the most radical work, but put it out in the most commercial way (...) to infiltrate the mainstream\".[66] In his review of the film, Richard Roeper wrote:\n\n\"Korine's camera is nearly an intrusive weapon as he lingers over the soft, limber bodies of Vanessa Hudgens, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and his wife, Rachel Korine.... I think that's sort of the point. When a pre-med student on spring break loses her top, drinks to the point of passing out, and grabs a willing lugnut by the ears for six hours of anonymous fun, is she setting the woman's movement back 40 years, or taking charge of her life like any man would do at that age?\"[47]\n\n### Accolades\n\nFranco won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor (tied with Jared Leto for Dallas Buyers Club), National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor, and San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor, while the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association nominated him for its Best Supporting Actor award.[67]\n\n#### Awards and nominations\n\n| Group                                                     | Date of ceremony            | Category                                             | Recipients                                                   | Outcome    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists Awards                 | December 19, 2013           | Actress Most in Need Of A New Agent                  | Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine, Selena Gomez &amp; Vanessa Hudgens | Nominated  |\n| 60th Belgian Film Critics Association                     | January 4, 2014             | Grand Prix                                           | Spring Breakers                                              | Nominated  |\n| 2nd Boston Online Film Critics Association Awards         | December 7, 2013            | Top Ten Best Films of the Year                       | Spring Breakers                                              | Won        |\n| Central Ohio Film Critics Association Awards              | January 2, 2014             | Best Supporting Actor                                | James Franco                                                 | Won        |\n| Central Ohio Film Critics Association Awards              | January 2, 2014             | Best Cinematography                                  | Benoît Debie                                                 | Nominated  |\n| 26th Chicago Film Critics Association Awards              | December 16, 2013           | Best Original Score                                  | Cliff Martinez &amp; Skrillex                                    | Nominated  |\n| 26th Chicago Film Critics Association Awards              | December 16, 2013           | Best Supporting Actor                                | James Franco                                                 | Nominated  |\n| Dublin Film Critics Circle Awards                         | December 20, 2013           | Best Cinematography                                  | Benoît Debie                                                 | Nominated  |\n| 14th Golden Trailer Awards                                | May 3, 2013                 | Trashiest Trailer                                    | Spring Breakers                                              | Won        |\n| 29th Independent Spirit Awards                            | March 1, 2014               | Best Cinematography                                  | Benoît Debie                                                 | Nominated  |\n| 5th Indiana Film Critics Association Awards               | December 16, 2013           | Best Film                                            | Spring Breakers                                              | Nominated  |\n| 79th New York Film Critics Circle Awards                  | December 3, 2013            | Best Supporting Actor                                | James Franco                                                 | Nominated  |\n| 39th Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards          | December 8, 2013            | Best Supporting Actor                                | James Franco                                                 | Won        |\n| 12th Washington D.C.

Welsh's script focused on a set of Spring Breakers coming into conflict with Christian extremists,[69] and Wild Bunch originally slated the film to debut at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival. Upon the announcement, Franco released a statement saying that the sequel was \"not being done with Harmony Korine or my consent\" and that the producers were \"capitalizing on that innovative film to make money on a weak sequel\" and attempting to \"make money off someone else's creativity\".[70]\n\nBy 2017, the project had been shelved in favor of a digital series for short-video platform Blackpills; the series never materialized, however, and Blackpills itself shut down after less than two years online. As a result, development on Spring Breakers: The Second Coming had restarted, with Harmony Korine, who would direct the 2019 film The Beach Bum, being open to directing and writing the sequel.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Cruz, Niki (February 14, 2013). \"'Spring Breakers' Gets An Early Release Date\".

As their classmates head to spring break, they are stuck behind because they don't have the money to travel. Desperate to make the trip, Brit and Candy, get high on cocaine, don ski masks, and rob a local restaurant, using the threat of hammers and realistic-looking squirt guns. They are assisted by Cotty, who drives (and later burns) the getaway car stolen from one of their professors. Cotty, Candy, and Brit divulge the details of their crime to a horrified Faith, who keeps quiet about it.\n\n        In St. Petersburg, Florida, the girls attend wild beach parties fueled by alcohol, drugs, and sex. After a particularly wild party, all four are arrested for using narcotics. They spend the night in a holding cell, but are bailed out by Alien, a rapper, drug hustler, and arms dealer. Alien charms Cotty, Candy, and Brit with his money and \"bad boy\" swagger, but Faith is extremely uncomfortable. Alien takes the girls to a local club frequented by gang members, where Faith becomes even more uneasy. Alien attempts to seduce Faith and convince her to stay with him, using equal parts menace, threats, and tenderness, but Faith leaves, begging the others to come with her. They refuse, and she returns to college alone.\n\n        Alien takes the remaining girls to a strip club owned by his rival and childhood best friend, Big Arch, who warns Alien to stop selling drugs in his territory. Alien takes the girls to his mansion, where he flaunts his drug money and cache of weapons, describing his life as the \"American Dream\". Brit and Candy grab two of his guns and threaten to kill him. Aroused, Alien fellates the gun and declares that he has fallen in love with the girls, claiming that they are his soulmates.\n\n        Alien arms the girls with pink ski masks and shotguns and takes them to his pool, where the girls ask him to play something inspiring on the piano. They sing Britney Spears' \"Everytime\", while a montage plays of them performing several armed robberies. While in Alien's car, they are approached by Big Arch and another member of his gang who threaten them and execute a drive-by shooting, wounding Cotty in the process. Alien promises to retaliate, but a traumatized Cotty comes to her senses and chooses to return to college. Brit and Candy stay behind and have three-way sex with Alien in his pool. The three decide to take revenge on Big Arch. In a flashforward, the two girls call home, promising to work harder and become better people.\n\n        In the present, the three take a motorboat to Big Arch's mansion. After they dock at the pier, Alien is immediately shot and killed by one of Big Arch's guards. Brit and Candy carry on, killing the rest of the members before confronting and killing Big Arch. The camera pans over the dead bodies of Big Arch's gang while the girls speak in a voice-over, first heard earlier in the film, describing the beach's beauty and musing that they have discovered who they truly are. Brit and Candy, silent and wearing pensive, ambiguous expressions, drive to college in Big Arch's Lamborghini. A final flashback shows the two girls kissing Alien's dead body before departing.\n    </Plot>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key information is highlighted with appropriate XML tags while maintaining the original meaning and context of the article.",

Set primarily in the fictional Exotica strip club in Toronto, the film concerns a father grieving over the loss of a child and his obsession with a young stripper. It was inspired by Egoyan's curiosity about the role strip clubs play in sex-obsessed societies. Exotica was filmed in Toronto in 1993.\n\nMarketed as an erotic thriller on its release in Canada and the United States, the film proved to be a major box office success for English-language Canadian cinema, and received positive reviews. It won numerous awards, including the FIPRESCI Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and eight Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.\n\n## Plot\n\nFrancis Brown, a tax auditor for Revenue Canada, is a regular visitor to a Toronto strip club called Exotica. He always has Christina, an exotic dancer dressed in a schoolgirl uniform, give him a private dance. This inspires the jealousy of the club's DJ, Eric, Christina's former boyfriend who has also impregnated the club's owner, Zoe. While at the club, Francis pays his brother Harold's teenage daughter, Tracey, to \"babysit\". However, Francis has no children and the girl merely practices music alone on his piano until Francis returns and drives her home. Francis' relationship with Harold is strained, as Francis learned that Harold and Francis' wife had been having an affair before she died in a car accident that left Harold a paraplegic. Francis' daughter, Lisa, had been kidnapped and murdered a few months before the accident, and he was one of the suspects but was later exonerated. These events have left a huge psychological scar on Francis.\n\nIn his professional life, Francis is sent to audit an exotic pet store owned and operated by Thomas Pinto, an introverted gay man profiting from the illegal import of a rare bird species. Thomas has been smuggling hyacinth macaw eggs, and his operation has afforded him hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, spurring suspicion from Canadian authorities. Francis soon discovers these illegal activities in Thomas' financial records.\n\nFrancis is eventually banned from Exotica when Eric manipulates him into touching Christina during one of her dances, violating the club's rules. Having realized that Eric intentionally set out to get Francis banned from the club, he vows to murder him. Armed with the knowledge of Thomas's tax evasion, Francis blackmails Thomas into visiting Exotica, and instructs him to touch Christina during one of her dances, so that Thomas too will be thrown out of the club; Francis intends to use this as an opportunity to infiltrate the club and murder Eric.\n\nFrancis affixes Thomas with a wiretap so that he can listen in on Thomas's visit to Exotica. While Christina gives Thomas a lap dance, he attempts to glean information from her, and the two have a conversation which Francis listens to from his parked car. Christina explains to Thomas that she and Francis share a relationship of mutual dependency, and reveals to Thomas personal details about Francis's life, specifically his daughter's murder. A distraught Francis exits his car and waits for Eric outside the club. Confronting Eric with a gun, Francis is defused when Eric reveals he and Christina, who met each other while volunteering in a search party for the missing Lisa, were the ones who discovered Lisa's dead body. Francis embraces Eric.\n\nIn a flashback, Francis drives a teenage Christina—who, at that time, worked for Francis and his wife as Lisa's babysitter—to her parents' home. During these routine drives, Francis would often comfort Christina over her troubled home life. As Francis drops Christina off at her house, he assures her that she can always confide in him.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Bruce Greenwood as Francis Brown\n- Mia Kirshner as Christina\n- Don McKellar as Thomas Pinto\n- Sarah Polley as Tracey Brown\n- Victor Garber as Harold Brown\n- David Hemblen as inspector\n- Peter Krantz as man in taxi\n- Arsinée Khanjian as Zoe\n- Elias Koteas as Eric\n- Calvin Green as customs officer\n- Damon D'Oliveira as man at opera\n- Jack Blum as scalper\n- Billy Merasty as man at opera\n- Ken McDougall as doorman\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector Atom Egoyan focused on strip clubs as outlets for society's sexual obsessions, while his pregnant wife Arsinée Khanjian played Zoe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector Atom Egoyan, who wrote the screenplay, first conceived of the story in the fall of 1992, intrigued by the ritualistic nature of table dances and the rule that clients can not touch the dancers, envisioning a story of a dancer having a main customer.[5] He believed a strip club could be an important setting for a film because of society's sexual obsessions, and the roles of such clubs as \"a collective sexual outlet\". While wanting to portray the clubs accurately, he also believed he could bring a skeptical perspective.[6]\n\nHe began working on the screenplay in February 1993.[5] In writing it, he \"wanted to structure the story like a striptease, gradually revealing an emotionally loaded history\".[7] He also cited thriller films as an influence.[8] Although the city in the film is not named, Egoyan stated Exotica and his other films portray \"different areas of Toronto\".[9]\n\nThe film had CAD 2 million budget,[2] with CAD 900,000 coming from Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation pledging CAD 700,000.[5] To save money, Egoyan's own 1990 Volvo 240 station wagon was used as Francis's car.[10]\n\n### Casting\n\nWith the script completed in April 1993, Egoyan began casting the film and choosing his crew, a process that took two months.[5]\n\nBruce Greenwood starred as Francis, having met Egoyan before the director became internationally prominent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEgoyan's wife Arsinée Khanjian played the club owner Zoe, having appeared in all of his previous films.[11] Zoe is pregnant with Eric's child, and in reality, Khanjian was pregnant during filming, with Egoyan's son Arshile.[12] Egoyan later expressed regret for surrounding Khanjian with nude women when she was unsure how her own body would change during her first pregnancy.[13]\n\nBruce Greenwood was cast in the film after he met Egoyan through a mutual friend in a bar, before the director had raised his international profile. Greenwood had previously appeared in St. Elsewhere and Knots Landing, and the two became friends.[14]\n\n### Filming\n\nArt directors Richard Paris and Linda Del Rosario built the Exotica strip club set in an unused room in the Party Centre, a Toronto building, with construction commencing in May 1993. During production, several people arrived at the set believing it was a real club.[5] For the outside of the club, the filmmakers used a shop on Mutual Street which has since been torn down, outside Metropolitan United Church. Osgoode Hall is used for the opera house.[15]\n\nThe cinematography was done by Paul Sarossy, with Egoyan saying the goal of the camerawork was to capture the perspective of a missing character, in this case Francis' dead daughter.[16] Principal photography was completed by July.[5] Composer Mychael Danna recorded his score for the film from India,[17] with influences from classical music in India.[5]\n\n## Release\n\nExotica was invited to compete in the Cannes Film Festival in May 1994, the first invitation for a Canadian film in several years.[18] Based on the good reactions from film festivals, the film was able to fully recoup its CAD 2 million budget via international pre-sales even before getting theatrical release in Canada.[19] The film was released on three screens in Toronto by Alliance Communications Corporation on September 29, 1994.[20] In the United States, the film was initially released by Miramax Films in six cities; its distributors were impressed when Exotica grossed $14,379 per screen, allowing for a broader release to 433 screens.[21] Miramax Films marketed the film as an erotic thriller.[22] Egoyan stated that he was \"very demanding that the image of Christina dressed as a schoolgirl won't be used on any posters, because it's an image that only makes sense in the context of the film\", adding that he was \"aware of how [the image] could be abused.\"[23] Egoyan also commented that he felt \"I don't think it's an erotic film at all. You begin by assuming the relationship between Francis and Christina is perverse, that he has a pedophiliac attraction to her. When you realize what is actually going on, it's platonic in the truest sense.\"[23]\n\nThe film played in Toronto for 25 weeks, at one point in an IMAX theatre.[24] In the United States, it was initially released in 500 theatres.[24] In the Philippines, the film was released on July 27, 1995, with ads containing the tagline, \"After Schindler's List and Belle Époque comes another controversial and multi-awarded hot film.\"[25]\n\n### Home media\n\nOn home video, Exotica went out of print in Canada for years, but was available on DVD in England through the company Network. In 2012, Alliance Films released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in Canada, with commentary from Egoyan and Danna.[17] The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on September 20, 2022 in the United States.[26][27]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $32,856 in its opening weekend in Toronto.[20] The film's initial box office performance in its limited release was considered \"huge\" by distributors.[22] In March 1995, U.S. critic Roger Ebert reported Exotica was breaking box office records in Canada.[28]\n\nBy 1995, Exotica had grossed $1.75 million in Canada, a substantial sum for English-language Canadian cinema.[24] The film ended its run after grossing $5.13 million in the United States and Canada.[21] The film grossed around CAD 15 million at worldwide box office.[29]Exotica was Egoyan's biggest financial success,[30] and has been called his box-office breakthrough.[31]\n\n### Critical response\n\nCanadian actress Mia Kirshner received positive reviews for her performance as Christina.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExotica received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 39 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 95%, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Exotica simmers with sex and obsession, while successfully doubling as an extreme character study.\"[32] On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[33]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film four stars upon the film's initial release, calling it \"a movie labyrinth, winding seductively into the darkest secrets of a group of people who should have no connection with one another, but do\". He judged it Egoyan's best film to date and said Mia Kirshner \"combines sexual allure with a kindness that makes her all the more appealing\".[34] In 2009, Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list, calling it a \"deep, painful film about those closed worlds of stage-managed lust\".[35] Jonathan Rosenbaum called it \"A must-see\" and \"lush and affecting\", praising the score, the set and the camera movements.[36] Leonard Klady, writing for Variety, called it \"a haunting, chilling experience\", albeit with an ending that was \"anticlimactic, fuzzy and considerably less than a knockout emotional punch\".[37] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, concluding \"Like Christina's dance, the movie is a gorgeous tease, an artful promise of something that never quite arrives\".[38] Desson Howe, writing for The Washington Post, said it \"starts off promisingly, but eventually sinks into its own convoluted oblivion\".[39] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote \"Exotica is Egoyan's most accomplished and seductive film to date\", and less flashy than the upcoming Showgirls (1995) promised to be.[40] B. Ruby Rich of The Advocate wrote the film is \"a jigsaw puzzle of the emotions in which sex spells out whole language of human behavior\", and said the cast, including Kirshner and Don McKellar, \"rivet our attention on these characters\".[41] Critics complimented use of the song \"Everybody Knows\" by Leonard Cohen.[38][39][42]\n\nIn 2001, Girish Shambu, writing for Senses of Cinema, said \"Atom Egoyan's sad, elegant Exotica (1994) is at once intimate and remote, concrete and abstract\", praising Bruce Greenwood for \"quiet gravity\" and Sarah Polley as \"precociously perfect\".[43] In 2002, readers of Playback voted it the seventh greatest Canadian film ever made.[44] In 2012, Jeff Heinrich of the Montreal Gazette gave the film five stars, calling it \"An utterly hypnotic, X-rated art film\" with a \"haunting score\".[17] Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club stated \"Exotica —much like Egoyan’s subsequent film, The Sweet Hereafter— proves to be a devastatingly cathartic exploration of tragedy's aftermath and the ways that people attempt to cope with inexpressible grief\".[45] In 2015, The Daily Telegraph named Exotica as one of \"the 10 best (and worst) stripper movies\", calling Egoyan \"a then-wunderkind of Canadian cinema\" and noting the film won awards at both Cannes and the AVN Awards,[46] which are for pornography.\n\nIn 2001, an industry poll conducted by Playback named it the fifth best Canadian film of the preceding 15 years.[47]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, Exotica won the FIPRESCI Prize,[48] the first time an English-language Canadian film had won the honour.[49] At the 1994 Genie Awards, the film won eight prizes, including Best Motion Picture and Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Egoyan.\n\n| Award                                | Date of ceremony    | Category

It tells three interlinked stories that span the social classes in Mexico City, from rich TV people to the working class to the homeless, and it circles through those stories with a nod to Quentin Tarantino, whose “Pulp Fiction” had a magnetic influence on young filmmakers.\n\nMany are influenced but few are chosen: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, making his feature debut, borrows what he can use, but is an original, dynamic director.\n\nThe title, loosely translated in English, is “Love’s a Bitch,” and all three of his stories involve dogs who become as important as the human characters. The film opens with a disclaimer promising that no animals were harmed in the making of the film. That notice usually appears at the ends of films, but putting it first in “Amores Perros” is wise, since the first sequence involves dog fights and all three will be painful for soft-hearted animal lovers to sit through.\n\n“Octavio and Susana,” the first segment, begins with cars hurtling through city streets in a chase and gunfight. The images are so quick and confused, at first we don’t realize the bleeding body in the back seat belongs to a dog. This is Cofi, the beloved fighting animal of Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), a poor young man who is helplessly in love with Susana (Vanessa Bauche), the teenage bride of his ominous brother Ramiro (Marco Perez). Flashbacks show how Cofi was shot after killing a champion dog; now the chase ends in a spectacular crash in an intersection–a crash that will involve all three of the movie’s stories.\n\nIn the second segment, “Daniel and Valeria,” we meet a television producer (Alvaro Guerrero) who has abandoned his family to live with a beautiful young model and actress (Goya Toledo). He’s rented a big new apartment for her; Valeria’s image smiles in from a billboard visible through a window. But then their happiness is marred when Valeria’s little dog chases a ball into a hole in the floor, disappears under the floorboards and won’t return. Is it lost, trapped or frightened? “There are thousands of rats down there,” Valeria wails to Daniel.\n\nWe discover that Valeria was involved in the crash that begins the movie; we see it this time from a different angle, and indeed it comes as a shock every time it occurs. Her leg is severely injured, and one complication leads to another–while the dog still snuffles under the floor, sometimes whining piteously, sometimes ominously silent. This sequence surely owes something to the great Spanish director Luis Bunuel, who made some of his best films in Mexico, and whose “Tristana” starred Catherine Deneuve as a beauty who loses her leg. The segment is sort of dark slapstick–morbid and ironic, as the romance is tested by the beauty’s mutilation and by the frustration (known to every pet owner) of a dog that will not come when it is called.\n\nFrom time to time during the first two segments, we’ve seen a street person, bearded and weathered, accompanied by his own pack of dogs. The third segment, “El Chivo and Maru,” stars the famous Mexican actor Emilio Echevarria, who, we learn, is a revolutionary-turned-squatter and supports himself by killing for hire. El Chivo is approached by a man who wants to get rid of his partner and is inspired to add his own brutal twist to this murder scheme. The three stories have many links, the most interesting perhaps that El Chivo has rescued the wounded dog Cofi and now cares for it.\n\n“Amores Perros” at 154 minutes is heavy on story–too heavy, some will say–and rich with character and atmosphere. It is the work of a born filmmaker, and you can sense Gonzalez Inarritu’s passion as he plunges into melodrama, coincidence, sensation and violence. His characters are not the bland, amoral totems of so much modern Hollywood violence, but people with feelings and motives. They want love, money and revenge. They not only love their dogs but desperately depend on them. And it is clear that the lower classes are better at survival than the wealthy, whose confidence comes from their possessions, not their mettle.\n\nThe movie reminded me not only of Bunuel but of two other filmmakers identified with Mexico: Arturo Ripstein and Alejandro Jodorowsky. Their works are also comfortable with the scruffy underbelly of society, and involve the dangers when jealousy is not given room to breathe. Consider Jodorowsky’s great “Santa Sangre” (1990), in which a cult of women cut off their own arms to honor a martyr. “Amores Perros” will be too much for some filmgoers, just as “Pulp Fiction” was and “Santa Sangre” certainly was, but it contains the spark of inspiration.\n\nNow streaming on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Roger Ebert\n\nRoger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013.

The film stars Robert Pattinson in the title role, alongside Naomi Ackie, Steven Yeun, Toni Collette, and Mark Ruffalo. Set in the future, the plot follows a man who joins a space colony as an \"Expendable\", a disposable worker who gets cloned every time he dies for research purposes.\n\nMickey 17 premiered at the 75th Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2025, before being theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in South Korea on February 28, 2025, and later in the United States on March 7. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many highlighting Bong's direction and Pattinson's performances.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the year 2054, Mickey Barnes and his friend Timo are financially destitute after a failed business venture. Unable to repay a murderous loan shark, the pair flee by signing up as crew for a spaceship that leaves Earth to colonize the planet Niflheim — Timo as a shuttle pilot and Mickey as the spaceship's only \"Expendable\". Using Earth-banned technology to clone Mickey and restore his memories, Mickey is treated as disposable, given lethal assignments and regenerated after death. During the voyage, a romance develops between Mickey and security agent Nasha.\n\nFour years later, the spaceship arrives at snowy Niflheim. Using several Mickeys sequentially, the spaceship's scientists develop a vaccine against Niflheim's pathogens. Mickey 17, the seventeenth Mickey iteration, is tasked to capture Niflheim's tardigrade-like lifeform (\"creeper\") for analysis. He falls into a fissure in the ice, beyond the reach of Timo, who leaves and reports Mickey 17's death. The creepers arrive and collectively push Mickey 17 out of the fissure.\n\nMickey 17 returns to the spaceship and meets the newly generated Mickey 18, who is more aggressive. As the expedition's leader, politician Kenneth Marshall, has vowed to kill any \"Multiples\" (simultaneously living clones), Mickey 18 tries to kill Mickey 17, who resists, suggesting that the Mickeys live by secretly rotating duties, meals and deaths. Mickey 18 then tries to kill Timo, but is interrupted and leaves with Nasha. Mickey 17 is brought to dinner with Marshall, his wife Ylfa, and security agent Kai. Mickey 17 suffers severe pain after being served experimental meat and being treated with experimental painkillers. Kai intervenes to stop Marshall from executing Mickey 17. Kai later woos Mickey 17, who flees.\n\nNasha learns of the Mickeys and accepts them both. Kai discovers the Mickeys and goes to report them, but is stopped by Nasha. When Mickey 17 informs Mickey 18 what happened at dinner, an enraged Mickey 18 decides to kill Marshall at a public ceremony commemorating a piece of Niflheim rock. Chaos ensues when two baby creepers emerge from the rock. Mickey 17 arrives and captures creeper Zoco, but creeper Luko jumps onto Marshall and is killed by Kai and other security agents. Nasha stops Mickey 18 from killing Marshall, who discovers the Multiples. Mickey 17, Mickey 18 and Nasha are arrested. Numerous creepers arrive outside the ship, calling out to Zoco.\n\nIn the brig, Mickey 17's description of the creepers helping him makes Nasha realize they are sentient. Timo tries to kill Mickey 17 to satisfy the loan shark, but Nasha and Mickey 18 overpower him. The Mickeys and Nasha are brought to Marshall, who wants to exterminate the creepers. Marshall destroys Mickey's stored memories, while Nasha saves Zoco from being executed by Ylfa. Marshall's assistant Preston persuades Marshall to task the Mickeys to compete in collecting creeper tails, which Ylfa wants for making edible sauce, with the winner being allowed to live. The Mickeys are forced to wear remote-detonated bomb vests to ensure their compliance.\n\nWhen the Mickeys are sent out, they peacefully seek out the creepers' leader, which prompts Marshall to go outside himself with a security team, intending to personally kill the creepers. Using a translation device, Mickey 17 communicates with the creepers' leader, informing on Marshall's plan. The creepers' leader threatens to kill all humans, unless Zoco is returned alive and one human is killed in recompense for Luko's death.\n\nMickey 17 communicates to Nasha via camera to free Zoco. Nasha takes Ylfa hostage to ensure Zoco's release. Nasha releases Ylfa, who tries to kill Zoco, but Nasha again saves him. The security agents arrest Ylfa. Nasha returns Zoco to the creepers' leader, while Mickey 18 fights Marshall. Mickey 18 detonates the bomb planted on his vest, killing himself and Marshall to fulfill the demand by the creepers' leader.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ylfa commits suicide in a psychiatric ward, while Preston and other Marshall collaborators are imprisoned. An associate of the loan shark tries to kill Timo, but Timo manages to kill him. Nasha is later elected as a colony political leader. She officiates a groundbreaking ceremony on Niflheim, where Mickey 17 (now \"Mickey Barnes\") detonates the cloning device to symbolically end the Expendable program.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes / Mickey 17 / Mickey 18, an expendable employee on Niflheim on his seventeenth (later eighteenth) iteration\n- Naomi Ackie as Nasha Barridge, a security agent and Mickey's love interest\n- Mark Ruffalo as Kenneth Marshall, an egomaniacal failed politician with sinister designs for Niflheim\n- Toni Collette as Ylfa Marshall, Kenneth Marshall's devious and controlling wife\n- Steven Yeun as Timo, a pilot and Mickey's friend from Earth\n- Patsy Ferran as Dorothy, a scientist\n- Cameron Britton as Arkady, the head of the Science team.\n- Daniel Henshall as Preston, Kenneth Marshall's personal assistant\n- Steve Park as Agent Zeke, the head of the Security team.\n- Anamaria Vartolomei as Kai Katz, a scientist and security agent\n- Holliday Grainger as Gemma\n- Angus Imrie as Shrimp Eyes\n- Tim Key as Pigeon Man\n- Thomas Turgoose as Bazooka Soldier\n- Anna Mouglalis as the Creepers' leader (voice)\n\n## Production\n\nFilmmaker Bong Joon Ho and actor Robert Pattinson in 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA film adaptation of Edward Ashton's novel Mickey7 was announced to be in development prior to its publication in January 2022, with Bong Joon Ho writing, directing, and producing for Warner Bros. Pictures and Robert Pattinson in talks to star.[6] Charles Yu wrote additional literary material for the film.[7] Bong was intrigued by the concepts presented in the book, though he made many changes to the characters, including modifying Mickey's personality to be a little more simple minded.[8] He wrote the screenplay in 2021 based on an early draft of the book, and said that none of the characters portrayed were meant to be mirroring active politicians. Robert Pattinson was the first actor to come to mind for a performance that required dual roles, and he agreed immediately to take the role after being offered it.[9] Pattinson improvised many lines as Mickey 18, who starts with an aggressive personality, then grows as a person who wants to protect 17.[10]\n\nBong storyboarded each sequence before filming.[11] Pattinson helped to revise part of the script to give what Bong described as \"humor and knowledge of slang that I would have never come across otherwise.\" Pattinson also partially based his performance on Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber, citing similar comedic injuries. Bong maintained that he had final cut privilege, though there was a delay in the editing.[12] To differentiate the two main Mickeys, Pattinson changed his accent for each character, comparing them to Ren and Stimpy from the show of the same name. In the initial script reading, he imitated the voices of Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O from Jackass. Bong told him not to do the Steve-O impression.[13]\n\nPattinson was confirmed to star in May 2022, with Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette, and Mark Ruffalo joining the cast.[14] In July, Steven Yeun was added to the cast.[15] Tim Key was cast after a phone call, as Bong wanted him specifically for a role.[11] Production began at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden on August 2, 2022,[16] and concluded in December 2022.[17] Filming was finished in January 2023, with the director working on the ideal cut after.[18]\n\nThe film's creepers were designed by Bong and Jang Hee-chul, who has been collaborating with Bong to create monsters for his movies since The Host (2006).[19]\n\n## Release\n\nMickey 17 premiered at the 75th Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2025, before opening in South Korea on February 28, 2025, a week before its global rollout.[20][21]\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on March 7, 2025, by Warner Bros. Pictures.[22] It was originally scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024, but was taken off the schedule due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[23][24] It was rescheduled for January 31, 2025 (where it would have opened three days earlier in South Korea) but was pushed back to April 18, 2025 to take advantage of Easter weekend and avoid competition with Dog Man, and finally to March 7, 2025, swapping the latter date with Sinners.[25][26][27][22]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nAs of March 13, 2025[update], Mickey 17 has grossed $28 million in the United States and Canada, and $34 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $62 million.[4][5] With a $118 million production budget and estimated $80 million marketing spend, the film needs to gross $340–400 million worldwide in order to break even.[28][29]\n\nIn South Korea, the film opened on February 28, 2025, and scored the highest post-pandemic debut by Warner Bros., grossing $1.7 million and surpassing the record previously set by Pattinson's 2022 film, The Batman.[30] It went on to debut to $9 million in its opening weekend.[31]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Mickey 17 was projected to gross $18–20 million from 3,770 theaters in its opening weekend.[32] It made $7.7 million on its first day, including an estimated $2.5 million from Thursday previews.[33] It went on to debut to $19 million,[34] which Deadline Hollywood described as in-line with original sci-fi films, including Jupiter Ascending ($18.3 million opening in 2015), Ad Astra ($19 million in 2019), and The Creator ($14 million in 2023). Because of the film's budget, the publication also projected that the film would not be immediately profitable for Warner Bros.[28]\n\n### Critical response\n\nMark Ruffalo plays Kenneth Marshall, who critics compared to authoritarian figures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 78% of 281 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Mickey 17 finds Bong Joon Ho returning to his forte of daffy sci-fi with a withering social critique at its core, proving along the way that you can never have too many Robert Pattinsons.\"[35] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72  out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[36] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it 4 out of 5 stars, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[28]\n\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph awarded the film 4 stars out of 5, noting: \"As in much of Bong's work, its chop-and-change attitude to genre keeps his audience on their toes. The film veers from slapstick to absurdism to horror and back again, often within a single shot, such as the regular sight of the latest Pattinson clone flopping out of the meat printer with a sausagey flumph.\"[37] Jacob Oller of The A.V. Club called the film \"An unwieldy, long-winded, wildly entertaining sci-fi critique of our dehumanizing present.\"[38] In his review for NPR, critic Justin Chang wrote that the film's satire \"wears awfully thin\", but that \"Bong is one of the few filmmakers who can work at this scale, with elaborate production design and intricate visual effects, and still retain his artistic signature.\"[39]\n\nA less enthusiastic review came from Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair, who deemed the film a \"disappointing follow-up to Parasite\", while stating: \"Perhaps if Bong had focused on the clone idea, more intricately exploring the corporate world's annihilating treatment of workers, he could have arrived at something rattling, even profound. Alas, he is ultimately too enamored of his wiggly animal creations, and by the broadest of jokes about TV camera-obsessed petty tyrants. In all its diminished attention span, Mickey 17 plays less like a new declaration from a great master and more like a feverish TikTok doom scroll leading nowhere.\"[40]\n\nJocelyn Noveck of the Associated Press gave the movie 2 stars out of 4, saying that although having Pattinson's character repeatedly die is an interesting plot-device, and the highlight of the film, that \"much of this film devolves into narrative chaos, bloat and excess.\"[41]\n\nKenneth Marshall, the spaceship captain and politician played by Mark Ruffalo, has been interpreted by some critics as a caricature of authoritarian leaders.[42][43][44] For instance, Polygon describes Marshall as \"a distinctly Trump-like figure whose dangerous associations with religious zealotry and white nationalism are mere avenues to earn political credibility among his base.\"[45] Director Bong Joon-Ho clarified that Marshall's character is not based on any specific individual but is \"a mix of many different politicians\" and \"dictators that we have seen throughout history.\"[46]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Mickey 17 (15)\".

I remember going to relative’s houses and playing the classic games on their Sega Genesis systems and eventually spending countless hours on my Gamecube with Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and Sonic Heroes.\n\nI remember having to play the Shadow the Hedgehog game, the one where he rides around with a motorcycle and a gun, at my cousins’ house because they had a copy of it and my parents wouldn’t get it for me. And, of course, who could forget that time we all collectively bullied Paramount because their character design was ugly.\n\n(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBad CGI aside, Paramount eventually fixed that and the first Sonic the Hedgehog movie turned out pretty great, and now that we seem to be living in a golden era of video game adaptations, I am ready for any and all Sonic cinematic content. So when Shadow, my favorite Sonic character, was revealed to be in the third installment of the film franchise, I just wanted the filmmakers to go fast and release it already.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 finds Sonic (Ben Schwartz), Knuckles (Idris Elba) and Tails (Colleen O’Shaughnessey) recruited by the Guardian Units of Nations agency (GUN) to help track down and subdue a mysterious a destructive force. When this turns out to be another alien named Shadow (Keanu Reeves) that looks exactly like Sonic except with teleportation powers and rocket shoes, Team Sonic is forced to join their old nemesis Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Jim Carrey) in order to take him down.\n\nSonic 3 is a fun movie for adults to watch, especially fans of the games, and in many moments it caters especially to them with jokes and references to the games that will likely fly right over the heads of younger audiences. However, Sonic 3 is absolutely a kids movie and probably the goofiest entry into the series (so far) both in terms of its humor and it’s frenetic, sugar-rush energy. While this does keep the pace going and the level of fun consistently high, that level of silliness clashes with the dark and heavy tone of the scenes that focus more on Shadow. It’s a case of a movie trying to do too much and is seemingly unsure whether it wants to be more serious and epic or comedic and kid-friendly. That isn’t to say that a movie can’t contain both moments of darkness and levity, but the balance isn’t quite there for Sonic 3.\n\n(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKids movies often get a bad rap and have a reputation for sometimes using comedy and colorful characters to cover up a threadbare story. Unfortunately, this is the case here. While the first two films in the series weren’t going to win any awards for being groundbreaking works of fiction, Sonic 3’s storyline felt especially flimsy, and under any level of scrutiny, plot holes start to pop up left and right.\n\nAdditionally, the entire time I was watching Sonic 3, I couldn’t help but feel like it was an amalgam of other franchises or tropes. For example, some battle scenes between Sonic and Shadow look like they were ripped right out of Dragonball with how the characters fly around and teleport.\n\nThe most obvious comparison is that the movie feels like baby’s first Fast and Furious film. Characters constantly talking about family? Check. Destructive chases through densely populated cities? Check. Heroes being recruited by the government for some reason? Check. Former enemies becoming welcome members of the team? Check. Again, this stuff isn’t bad. In fact I really liked those fight scenes and the parallels to Fast and Furious are actually kind of funny, however, the film would have been better if it had tried for more original ideas rather than borrowing or paying homage as much as it did.\n\n(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor me the main draw of Sonic 3 was Shadow, who was set up to be the big bad. While I loved the scenes we got with him, he pretty much gets sidelined for a good third of the movie once Gerald Robotnik (also played by Carrey) shows up. His character brings a much-needed sense of danger and gravitas to the film, but his whole schtick of “teleport around and kick people then leave” gets old fairly quickly. In addition, he’s so much stronger than anyone on Team Sonic that it brings up questions of power creep and is almost unbelievable that he would ever lose a fight. The film needed to use Shadow more effectively and give him more to do than mope about revenge.  If he returns for future films, then I hope he is given a much larger role.\n\nReeves’ performance as Shadow is excellent. Channeling a lot of his John Wick, Reeves nails the brooding, wounded, edgy energy that the character has always carried. His rage, weariness and gruff delivery are elevated by how well they contrast Shadow from the brighter, more youthful voices of Sonic and Tails. Again, I just want more of Shadow.\n\nThe rest of the cast voice cast are great as usual. Schwartz’s Sonic feels as exuberant, friendly and heroic as every, and in the few moments when the character feels rage or sorrow, Schwartz gives it his all, adding necessary depth to the role. O’Shaughnessey continues to charm as Tails. Idris Elba is probably one of my favorite parts of the movie as his powerful voice full of gravitas is used to deliver the silly lines of Knuckles obsessing over how muscular he is.\n\n(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJim Carrey does double duty this time around as two Dr. Robotniks: Ivo (who we know as Eggman) and Gerald, his long-lost grandfather. I enjoy Carrey’s work. You go into a Carrey film knowing that his character will likely be unhinged and psychotic. His performances as Eggman in the last two Sonic films were some of the funniest and most memorable parts of those movies. However, as I’ve noticed is a trend in Hollywood recently, Sonic 3 takes what was good in moderation and oversaturates it to the point of ruin.\n\nThere is little to distinguish between the two Dr. Robotniks other than the old age makeup/prosthetics and white mustache on Gerald. Their behaviors and quirks are exactly the same. Where one insane, narcissistic megalomanic made for a fun and memorable villain, adding in the second Robotnik is just overwhelmingly silly. When paired with the darker, more cynical scenes with Shadow, the lack of cohesion in the film’s tone becomes even more apparent and jarring.  Carrey is just doing what we love him for and what he does best, but less really is sometimes more and having two Jim Carreys unfortunately undermines what made him such a fun Robotnik in the first place.\n\nDespite my criticisms, I like Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The characters are charming, bright, and fun. The jokes, if a little dated, are funny. I enjoyed all the different locations in the film from the lush forest of Green Hills to the vibrant streets of Japan, and the fast-paced races and fights are as thrilling as ever. It’s a film that was made to get families in theaters and entertain them for a couple of hours, and not a film that was made to stand up to any real scrutiny, which makes it difficult if you’re a film critic like me. That said, I have to do my job and as much as I had a good time in the theater, Sonic 3 comes in third in terms of quality among the franchise.\n\n(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is a film clearly meant to cater to kids and often times feels like the filmmakers cobbled together ideas from other franchises and softened off the edginess to make them more family-friendly. While the cast is as consistently good as they’ve always been, Reeves is underused as Shadow and Carrey is overused as both Ivo and Gerald Robotnik. The films indecision whether it wants to focus on the darker side of the Sonic lore with Shadow’s story or whether it wants to cram as many jokes in as possible creates an inconsistent and confusing tone, unlike the previous installments that were sure of the stories they were telling.\n\nDespite all of that, I dare you to stick around for the mid-credit and end credit scenes and tell me you’re not excited for Sonic 4.\n\nRating: 6.5/10\n\n## Sonic the Hedgehog 3 races into theaters on December 20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Author\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWritten by\n\nMatt Fernandez\n\n```\n[{\"id\":179836,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/geeksofcolor.co\\/2025\\/03\\/11\\/princess-mononoke-imax\\/\",\"name\":\"princess-mononoke-imax\",\"thumbnail\":{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/i0.wp.com\\/geeksofcolor.co\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2025\\/03\\/Screenshot-2025-03-11-at-10.01.43%E2%80%AFpm.png?fit=2728%2C1394&ssl=1\",\"alt\":\"\"},\"title\":\"4K Restoration of 'princess Mononoke' To debut Exclusively in IMAX Theatres\",\"excerpt\":\"\",\"content\":\"In honour of Studio Ghibli's 40th anniversary, GKIDS is releasing a 4K restoration of Academy Award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke.

And, of course, who could forget that time we all collectively bullied Paramount because their character design was ugly.</p>\n        \n        <p>Bad CGI aside, Paramount eventually fixed that and the first <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog</Name>\n            <ReleaseYear>2020</ReleaseYear>\n        </movieRecommendation> movie turned out pretty great, and now that we seem to be living in a golden era of video game adaptations, I am ready for any and all Sonic cinematic content. So when <Character>Shadow</Character>, my favorite Sonic character, was revealed to be in the third installment of the film franchise, I just wanted the filmmakers to go fast and release it already.</p>\n        \n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> finds <Character>Sonic</Character>, <Character>Knuckles</Character>, and <Character>Tails</Character> recruited by the Guardian Units of Nations agency (GUN) to help track down and subdue a mysterious destructive force. When this turns out to be another alien named <Character>Shadow</Character> that looks exactly like <Character>Sonic</Character> except with teleportation powers and rocket shoes, Team Sonic is forced to join their old nemesis <Character>Dr. Ivo Robotnik</Character> in order to take him down.</p>\n        \n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> is a fun movie for adults to watch, especially fans of the games, and in many moments it caters especially to them with jokes and references to the games that will likely fly right over the heads of younger audiences. However, <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> is absolutely a kids movie and probably the goofiest entry into the series (so far) both in terms of its humor and its frenetic, sugar-rush energy. While this does keep the pace going and the level of fun consistently high, that level of silliness clashes with the dark and heavy tone of the scenes that focus more on <Character>Shadow</Character>. It’s a case of a movie trying to do too much and is seemingly unsure whether it wants to be more serious and epic or comedic and kid-friendly. That isn’t to say that a movie can’t contain both moments of darkness and levity, but the balance isn’t quite there for <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation>.</p>\n        \n        <p>Kids movies often get a bad rap and have a reputation for sometimes using comedy and colorful characters to cover up a threadbare story. Unfortunately, this is the case here. While the first two films in the series weren’t going to win any awards for being groundbreaking works of fiction, <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation>’s storyline felt especially flimsy, and under any level of scrutiny, plot holes start to pop up left and right.</p>\n        \n        <p>Additionally, the entire time I was watching <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, I couldn’t help but feel like it was an amalgam of other franchises or tropes. For example, some battle scenes between <Character>Sonic</Character> and <Character>Shadow</Character> look like they were ripped right out of Dragonball with how the characters fly around and teleport.</p>\n        \n        <p>The most obvious comparison is that the movie feels like baby’s first Fast and Furious film. Characters constantly talking about family? Check. Destructive chases through densely populated cities? Check. Heroes being recruited by the government for some reason? Check. Former enemies becoming welcome members of the team? Check. Again, this stuff isn’t bad. In fact, I really liked those fight scenes and the parallels to Fast and Furious are actually kind of funny; however, the film would have been better if it had tried for more original ideas rather than borrowing or paying homage as much as it did.</p>\n        \n        <p>For me, the main draw of <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> was <Character>Shadow</Character>, who was set up to be the big bad. While I loved the scenes we got with him, he pretty much gets sidelined for a good third of the movie once <Character>Gerald Robotnik</Character> shows up. His character brings a much-needed sense of danger and gravitas to the film, but his whole schtick of “teleport around and kick people then leave” gets old fairly quickly. In addition, he’s so much stronger than anyone on Team Sonic that it brings up questions of power creep and is almost unbelievable that he would ever lose a fight. The film needed to use <Character>Shadow</Character> more effectively and give him more to do than mope about revenge. If he returns for future films, then I hope he is given a much larger role.</p>\n        \n        <p><Character>Reeves</Character>’ performance as <Character>Shadow</Character> is excellent. Channeling a lot of his John Wick, <Character>Reeves</Character> nails the brooding, wounded, edgy energy that the character has always carried. His rage, weariness, and gruff delivery are elevated by how well they contrast <Character>Shadow</Character> from the brighter, more youthful voices of <Character>Sonic</Character> and <Character>Tails</Character>. Again, I just want more of <Character>Shadow</Character>.</p>\n        \n        <p>The rest of the cast voice cast are great as usual. <Character>Schwartz</Character>’s <Character>Sonic</Character> feels as exuberant, friendly, and heroic as ever, and in the few moments when the character feels rage or sorrow, <Character>Schwartz</Character> gives it his all, adding necessary depth to the role. <Character>O’Shaughnessey</Character> continues to charm as <Character>Tails</Character>. <Character>Idris Elba</Character> is probably one of my favorite parts of the movie as his powerful voice full of gravitas is used to deliver the silly lines of <Character>Knuckles</Character> obsessing over how muscular he is.</p>\n        \n        <p><Character>Jim Carrey</Character> does double duty this time around as two <Character>Dr. Robotniks</Character>: <Character>Ivo</Character> (who we know as Eggman) and <Character>Gerald</Character>, his long-lost grandfather. I enjoy <Character>Carrey</Character>’s work. You go into a <Character>Carrey</Character> film knowing that his character will likely be unhinged and psychotic. His performances as <Character>Eggman</Character> in the last two <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> films were some of the funniest and most memorable parts of those movies. However, as I’ve noticed is a trend in Hollywood recently, <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> takes what was good in moderation and oversaturates it to the point of ruin.</p>\n        \n        <p>There is little to distinguish between the two <Character>Dr. Robotniks</Character> other than the old age makeup/prosthetics and white mustache on <Character>Gerald</Character>. Their behaviors and quirks are exactly the same. Where one insane, narcissistic megalomaniac made for a fun and memorable villain, adding in the second <Character>Robotnik</Character> is just overwhelmingly silly. When paired with the darker, more cynical scenes with <Character>Shadow</Character>, the lack of cohesion in the film’s tone becomes even more apparent and jarring. <Character>Carrey</Character> is just doing what we love him for and what he does best, but less really is sometimes more and having two <Character>Jim Carreys</Character> unfortunately undermines what made him such a fun <Character>Robotnik</Character> in the first place.</p>\n        \n        <p>Despite my criticisms, I like <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation>. The characters are charming, bright, and fun. The jokes, if a little dated, are funny. I enjoyed all the different locations in the film from the lush forest of Green Hills to the vibrant streets of Japan, and the fast-paced races and fights are as thrilling as ever. It’s a film that was made to get families in theaters and entertain them for a couple of hours, and not a film that was made to stand up to any real scrutiny, which makes it difficult if you’re a film critic like me. That said, I have to do my job and as much as I had a good time in the theater, <movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> comes in third in terms of quality among the franchise.</p>\n        \n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <Name>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</Name>\n        </movieRecommendation> is a film clearly meant to cater to kids and often times feels like the filmmakers cobbled together ideas from other franchises and softened off the edginess to make them more family-friendly.

Produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures, it is a spin-off and story within a story of Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017) and the second film in the Captain Underpants franchise. The film was written and directed by Peter Hastings, and stars the voices of Pete Davidson, Lil Rel Howery, Isla Fisher, Lucas Hopkins Calderon (in his film debut), and Ricky Gervais, with Hastings providing vocal effects for the titular character. The film loosely adapts the first, the third, and the seventh Dog Man books.\n\nDreamWorks Animation announced a film adaptation of Dog Man in December 2020, with Hastings set to direct after his experience with Pilkey's works from The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants (2018–20). Karen Foster joined as a producer in January 2024, and the cast was announced that September.\n\nDog Man premiered at the 2025 edition of the Festival de l'Alpe d'Huez in Alpe d'Huez, France on January 15, 2025, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 31. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $121.7 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2025.\n\n## Plot\n\nA villainous orange cat named Petey constantly terrorizes Ohkay City, with one of his schemes involving planting a bomb to destroy an abandoned warehouse. Famed cop Officer Knight and his dog Greg arrive to defuse the bomb, but it explodes, severely injuring Knight's head and Greg's body. Two surgeons save Knight and Greg by stitching Greg's head onto Knight's body, creating the dog-human hybrid Dog Man. Dog Man quickly becomes beloved for his repeated arrests of Petey, creating a heated rivalry between the two, but becomes lonely and depressed due to the loss of his owner, girlfriend, and house. He takes a tennis ball he used to play with and moves into a doghouse on the city outskirts.\n\nAfter firing his assistant, Petey decides to clone himself to create an assistant just like him. However, it creates a copy of him as an innocent child with no interest in evildoing, whom he calls Li'l Petey. Petey steals the corpse of an evil telekinetic fish named Flippy and plans to use Living Spray to resurrect him and defeat Dog Man, but Li'l Petey interferes. Petey decides to abandon him in a cardboard box in the middle of the city, where Dog Man finds and decides to adopt him.\n\nAt his lair, Petey discovers a picture book drawn by Li'l Petey depicting both of them as a family. Feeling guilty, Petey uses his orb-shaped mech, named 80-HD, to kidnap him. Petey reveals to his clone that his abusive father abandoned him as a child. In an attempt to cheer him up, Li'l Petey uses 80-HD to bring Petey's father, called Grampa by Li'l Petey, to his lair. Grampa immediately starts berating Petey, revealing that he has not changed despite Li'l Petey's hopes.\n\nFlippy is resurrected at the Living Spray factory after being mishandled by the factory employees, which also causes the factory itself to come to life. Having been reprogrammed by Petey to destroy all do-gooders, he targets Dog Man and his friends, who fight a horde of buildings affected by the Living Spray. Petey reluctantly decides to team up with Dog Man, swapping out Li'l Petey inside 80-HD with himself. Flippy decides to drop him into a volcano, but Li'l Petey arrives and shows him a comic book depicting them as friends, making him drop his evil ways. Dog Man sacrifices his old tennis ball to save Petey from falling in the lava.\n\nWhile Flippy gets arrested, Petey is pardoned as a do-gooder for his actions. Refusing to be considered a do-gooder, he and Li'l Petey return to their lair to find that Grampa took everything except for Li'l Petey's books. Petey decides to share custody of his son with Dog Man, and he heads back with a new outlook on life.\n\n## Voice cast\n\n- Peter Hastings as the voice of Dog Man, a hybrid between a dog and a police officer who was created as a result of a medical operation that fused an injured Officer Knight together with his pet dog, Greg. Keeping in line with the source material, Dog Man does not speak, although Hastings still provides his barks and expressions.[ 6]\n    - Hastings also voices Officer Knight, a police officer whose body from the neck down is used to create Dog Man, and also provides the vocal effects of Greg, Knight's dog whose head is used to create Dog Man.\n- Pete Davidson as Petey, a quick-witted and arrogant orange cat who is Dog Man's archenemy and the self-proclaimed \"world's most evilest cat\"[7][8]\n- Lucas Hopkins Calderon as Li'l Petey, a kind-hearted kitten clone of Petey and Dog Man's adopted son and sidekick[6]\n- Lil Rel Howery as Chief, the irritable yet supportive police chief of the station Dog Man works at[7][8]\n- Isla Fisher as Sarah Hatoff, a news reporter.[8]\n- Billy Boyd as Seamus, Sarah's cameraman[8]\n- Ricky Gervais as Flippy the Fish, a fish with telekinesis[8]\n- Stephen Root as Grampa, Petey's estranged father[8]\n- Poppy Liu as Butler, Petey's former assistant[8]\n- Luenell as Milly, Chief's assistant\n- Cheri Oteri as the Mayor of Ohkay City, who frequently berates Chief and Dog Man's police work[9]\n- Kate Micucci as Dippy, a donut shop owner who tries to adopt Li'l Petey\n- Melissa Villaseñor as the realtor who sells Officer Knight's house.[9] In the British English version, the role was dubbed by Louise Redknapp.\n- Brian Hopkins as Big Jim, an inmate at Cat jail who is friends with Petey\n- Yung Gravy as Mr. Whiskers, a tough inmate at Cat jail\n\nGeorge Beard and Harold Hutchins, the in-universe creators of Dog Man and Captain Underpants, make a brief appearance. Kelly Stables provides the voice of Harold, who was previously voiced by Thomas Middleditch in Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie.[10]\n\n## Production\n\nOn December 9, 2020, DreamWorks Animation (DWA) announced that a film based on the Captain Underpants spin-off graphic novel series Dog Man was in development, with Peter Hastings attached to direct after his experience with Dav Pilkey's works from The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants (2018–20).[11] On January 29, 2024, following the release date announcement, DreamWorks announced that Karen Foster would serve as producer.[12] On September 17, 2024, with the release of the first trailer, Pete Davidson, Lil Rel Howery, Isla Fisher, Poppy Liu, Stephen Root, Billy Boyd, and Ricky Gervais were revealed to be part of the film's voice cast.[7][8]\n\nOn October 6, 2023, the film was confirmed to be released in 2025, while it was also confirmed that Dog Man and Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie would be animated entirely at partner studios (excluding Sony Pictures Imageworks who was named as the animation partner for The Bad Guys 2).[13] Unlike Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017), which was animated by Mikros Image and Technicolor Animation Productions, the film's animation is handled by Jellyfish Pictures, who previously did the animation for DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon: Homecoming (2019) and Spirit Untamed (2021), along with marketing custom animation for Trolls World Tour (2020) and providing additional production assets for The Boss Baby: Family Business (2021), The Bad Guys (2022), and Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024). Nate Wragg was the production designer.[14] The film's score was composed by Tom Howe.[15]\n\n## Marketing\n\nIn May 2024, Jakks Pacific and its costume division Disguise entered into a partnership with Dav Pilkey to make merchandise based on the Dog Man film along with the comic book series. A book featuring the art of the film was released on December 10, 2024, published by Abrams Books.[16] Universal's marketing campaign for the film began in September 2024 with a trailer on YouTube that accumulated 102 million views. Theatrical trailers were paired with screenings of Transformers One, The Wild Robot, Moana 2, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Television advertisements targeted families during the holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas) during airings of the National Dog Show, holiday specials, New Year's Eye programming, show premieres and finales, and major sports events. The push extended to Amazon devices, Hulu, Peacock, and Hallmark. On January 20, Dog Man was integrated into the Food Network's Kids Baking Championship, with a film-themed baking challenge, sets, and custom animation. Social media analytics firm RelishMix reported that online marketing led to 246.6 million interactions across social media platforms, attracting both fans of the graphic novels and newcomers intrigued by the animation style.[17]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nDog Man had its world premiere during the 2025 edition of the Festival de l'Alpe d'Huez in Alpe d'Huez, France on January 15, 2025, and was released theatrically in the United States on January 31.[1][12] On January 24, 2025, a week before release, DreamWorks announced that the short film Little Lies and Alibis, a short connected to DWA's film The Bad Guys, would run before Dog Man in theaters; the film also serves as a promotional feature for DWA's following film, The Bad Guys 2, set to release on August 1.[18]\n\n### Home media\n\nDog Man was made available for purchase and rent on digital streaming services on February 18, 2025.[19][20] The film will be released on April 1 on DVD and Blu-ray.[21] As part of Universal's long-term deal with Netflix, the film will stream on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window before moving to Netflix for the next ten and then returning to Peacock for the remaining four.[22][23]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nAs of March 13, 2025[update], Dog Man has grossed $90.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $31.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $121.7 million.[4][5]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Dog Man was released alongside Companion and Valiant One and was projected to gross $20–30 million from 3,800 theaters in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $40 million.[3][24] It made $10.8 million on its first day, including an estimated $1.36 million from Thursday night previews. It debuted to $36 million, topping the box office. The opening was the second biggest for animated films released in January after DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016; $41.8 million) and the third consecutive box office-topping debut for DreamWorks after Kung Fu Panda 4 and The Wild Robot (both 2024). Exit polling indicated that 45% of attendees saw the film because it looked \"fun\" and \"entertaining\" and a third bought tickets because they were fans of the IP. Men accounted for 52% of the opening weekend audience, with those under 35 comprising 70% and premium large format screens contributing 22%.[17] During Super Bowl weekend, in which movies in the United States regularly perform below average, the film grossed $13.8 million, dropping a bigger-than-expected 61.6% while remaining atop the box office.[25][26] During its four-day third weekend, it made $13.4 million and finished in third place.[27][28]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 86 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Realizing Dav Pilkey's canine creation with a frenzied energy that never lets up, Dog Man will delight kids while throwing their parents a bone.\"[29] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[30] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[17]\n\n## See also\n\n- Dog Man (soundtrack)\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"Programme - Festival de l'Alpe de Huez\" (in French).

Produced by <ProductionCompany>DreamWorks Animation</ProductionCompany> and distributed by <DistributedBy>Universal Pictures</DistributedBy>, it is a spin-off and story within a story of Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (2017) and the second film in the Captain Underpants franchise. The film was written and directed by <Director>Peter Hastings</Director>, and stars the voices of <MainCharacters>Pete Davidson, Lil Rel Howery, Isla Fisher, Lucas Hopkins Calderon, and Ricky Gervais</MainCharacters>, with Hastings providing vocal effects for the titular character. The film loosely adapts the first, the third, and the seventh Dog Man books.\n\n        DreamWorks Animation announced a film adaptation of Dog Man in December 2020, with Hastings set to direct after his experience with Pilkey's works from The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants (2018–20). Karen Foster joined as a producer in January 2024, and the cast was announced that September.\n\n        Dog Man premiered at the 2025 edition of the Festival de l'Alpe d'Huez in Alpe d'Huez, France on <ReleaseYear>January 15, 2025</ReleaseYear>, and was theatrically released in the United States on <ReleaseYear>January 31</ReleaseYear>. The film received positive reviews from critics and has grossed <BoxOffice>$121.7 million</BoxOffice> worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2025.\n\n        <PlotComplexity>\n            A villainous orange cat named Petey constantly terrorizes Ohkay City, with one of his schemes involving planting a bomb to destroy an abandoned warehouse. Famed cop Officer Knight and his dog Greg arrive to defuse the bomb, but it explodes, severely injuring Knight's head and Greg's body. Two surgeons save Knight and Greg by stitching Greg's head onto Knight's body, creating the dog-human hybrid Dog Man. Dog Man quickly becomes beloved for his repeated arrests of Petey, creating a heated rivalry between the two, but becomes lonely and depressed due to the loss of his owner, girlfriend, and house. He takes a tennis ball he used to play with and moves into a doghouse on the city outskirts.\n        </PlotComplexity>\n\n        After firing his assistant, Petey decides to clone himself to create an assistant just like him. However, it creates a copy of him as an innocent child with no interest in evildoing, whom he calls Li'l Petey. Petey steals the corpse of an evil telekinetic fish named Flippy and plans to use Living Spray to resurrect him and defeat Dog Man, but Li'l Petey interferes. Petey decides to abandon him in a cardboard box in the middle of the city, where Dog Man finds and decides to adopt him.\n\n        At his lair, Petey discovers a picture book drawn by Li'l Petey depicting both of them as a family. Feeling guilty, Petey uses his orb-shaped mech, named 80-HD, to kidnap him. Petey reveals to his clone that his abusive father abandoned him as a child. In an attempt to cheer him up, Li'l Petey uses 80-HD to bring Petey's father, called Grampa by Li'l Petey, to his lair. Grampa immediately starts berating Petey, revealing that he has not changed despite Li'l Petey's hopes.\n\n        Flippy is resurrected at the Living Spray factory after being mishandled by the factory employees, which also causes the factory itself to come to life. Having been reprogrammed by Petey to destroy all do-gooders, he targets Dog Man and his friends, who fight a horde of buildings affected by the Living Spray. Petey reluctantly decides to team up with Dog Man, swapping out Li'l Petey inside 80-HD with himself. Flippy decides to drop him into a volcano, but Li'l Petey arrives and shows him a comic book depicting them as friends, making him drop his evil ways. Dog Man sacrifices his old tennis ball to save Petey from falling in the lava.\n\n        While Flippy gets arrested, Petey is pardoned as a do-gooder for his actions. Refusing to be considered a do-gooder, he and Li'l Petey return to their lair to find that Grampa took everything except for Li'l Petey's books. Petey decides to share custody of his son with Dog Man, and he heads back with a new outlook on life.\n    </content>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the relevant information is tagged according to the specified attributes.

A co-production between Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the film stars Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Christopher Abbott, and Jerrod Carmichael.[6] Stone plays Bella Baxter, a young woman in Victorian London who has been brought back to life via brain transplant.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Hungary from August to December 2021. Poor Things premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2023, and won the Golden Lion there. The film received critical acclaim and was released theatrically in the United States on December 8, 2023, and in Ireland and the United Kingdom on January 12, 2024, by Searchlight Pictures. It also became a box office success, grossing over $117 million worldwide on a budget of $35 million, becoming Lanthimos' highest-grossing film.[7] Poor Things was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, and received various accolades, including four wins at the 96th Academy Awards, two at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, and five at the 77th British Academy Film Awards; Stone won Best Actress at each ceremony.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn late-Victorian London,[b] the medical student Max McCandles is recruited by the mad scientist Godwin Baxter to record the behaviour of a strange, nearly mute woman living in Godwin's house. Godwin reveals that her body is that of a woman who was pregnant and committed suicide by leaping off a bridge; Godwin replaced the woman's brain with that of the fetus, giving her an infant's mind, and named her Bella Baxter.\n\nAs weeks pass, Bella's vocabulary improves and she exhibits childlike wonder at the world. With Godwin's encouragement, Max falls in love with Bella and proposes marriage. Bella accepts, but soon discovers masturbation and sexual pleasure, leading her to run off with Duncan Wedderburn, a debauched lawyer, to Lisbon. There, they have near-constant intercourse as Bella lives purely for pleasure. She is mistakenly addressed as \"Victoria Blessington\" by a fellow hotel guest.\n\nAs Bella becomes difficult for Duncan to control, he smuggles her onto a cruise ship, where she befriends two passengers who open her mind to philosophy. Duncan attempts to stunt her growth to no avail, and indulges in drinking and gambling. During a stop at Alexandria, Bella witnesses the suffering of the poor and becomes distraught. Wishing to help them, she entrusts Duncan's winnings to unscrupulous members of the crew, who falsely promise to give it to them. Unable to afford the rest of the trip, Bella and Duncan are dropped off at Marseille and make their way to Paris, penniless. Seeking money and accommodation, Bella begins working at a brothel. Enraged, Duncan breaks down, and Bella abandons him. At the brothel, she comes under the tutelage of Madame Swiney and begins a relationship with fellow prostitute Toinette, who introduces her to socialism.\n\nNow terminally ill, Godwin asks Max to bring Bella to him. Max finds her after tracking down Duncan, who has been institutionalized. Back in London, Bella reconciles with Godwin and renews her plans to marry Max, but their wedding is interrupted by Duncan and General Alfie Blessington. Alfie, addressing Bella as Victoria, declares that they were married before her disappearance and that he has come to reclaim her. Bella leaves Max to learn of her past life, but discovers Alfie's violent and sadistic nature. Bella realizes that she was Victoria, and that she killed herself to escape Alfie.\n\nAlfie confines Bella to his mansion and tells her that he plans to have her clitoris removed and impregnate her, threatening her with a gun and demanding she drink a sedative. She tosses the sedative in his face.  Alfie accidentally shoots himself in the foot and passes out. Bella returns to Godwin's house and, with Max's help, transplants a goat's brain into Alfie's head. Godwin dies peacefully with Bella and Max at his side. Bella, Max, and Toinette begin a new life in Godwin's house, while Alfie eats grass happily.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Emma Stone as Bella Baxter/Victoria Blessington\n- Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn\n- Willem Dafoe as Dr. Godwin Baxter\n- Ramy Youssef as Max McCandles\n- Christopher Abbott as Alfie Blessington\n- Suzy Bemba as Toinette\n- Jerrod Carmichael as Harry Astley\n- Kathryn Hunter as Swiney\n- Vicki Pepperdine as Mrs. Prim\n- Margaret Qualley as Felicity\n- Hanna Schygulla as Martha von Kurtzroc\n- Keeley Forsyth as Allison the maid\n- John Locke as David the butler\n- Kate Handford as Kitty\n- Owen Good as Gerald\n- Damien Bonnard as Father\n- Tom Stourton as Steward\n- Raphaël Thiéry as Saveur the butcher\n- Wayne Brett as Priest\n- Carminho as Fado singing woman\n- Jerskin Fendrix as Lisbon restaurant musician\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector and co-producer Yorgos Lanthimos\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProduced by Film4 Productions, Element Pictures, TSG Entertainment, and Searchlight Pictures, development on the film began as early as 2009, when Lanthimos went to Scotland to discuss the acquisition of the rights to Poor Things with the author, Alasdair Gray. \"He was a very lovely man\", Lanthimos said. \"Unfortunately, he died just a couple of years before we actually made the film, but he was very special and energetic; he was 80-something [when we met], and as soon as I got there, he had seen Dogtooth and said, 'I had my friend put on the DVD, because I don't know how to operate these things, but I think you're very talented, young man.'\" Lanthimos said Gray took him on a personal tour of Glasgow, where Gray showed him several places he had incorporated into the story.[9]\n\nWhile filming The Favourite (2018), Lanthimos revisited the project, which he discussed with Emma Stone, who starred in that film. He began developing Poor Things more actively after the success of The Favourite: \"After the relative success of The Favourite, where I actually made a slightly more expensive film that was successful, people were more inclined to allow me to do whatever it is that I wanted, so I just went back to Gray's book and said, 'This is what I want to do.' It was a long process, but the book was always on my mind.\" While developing the film, Lanthimos and Stone collaborated on the short film Bleat (2022).[10]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPoor Things was announced in February 2021.[11] Lanthimos said that working with Stone again gave him an advantage, as they had developed a mutual trust. Stone also discussed how the process of making Poor Things was different from making The Favourite because she also acted as a producer: \"It was so interesting to be involved in how the film was being pieced together, from cast to department heads to what have you. Ultimately, Yorgos was the one making those decisions, but I was very involved in the process, which started during the pandemic; we were reaching out to people and casting and everything during that time, because we couldn't go anywhere.\"[10]\n\n### Casting\n\nWillem Dafoe entered negotiations to join the cast in March 2021.[12] In April, Ramy Youssef was in talks to join.[13] Dafoe and Youssef were confirmed to join in May, with Mark Ruffalo and Jerrod Carmichael also added to the cast.[14][15] In September, Christopher Abbott was cast.[16] In November, Margaret Qualley and Suzy Bemba were cast,[17] with Kathryn Hunter also revealing she had a role in the film.[18]\n\nIn preparation for her role, Stone took dance lessons and accidentally dyed her hair black. Lanthimos liked the contrast between the dark hair and Stone's fair complexion.[19][20] Stone said she was attracted to the idea of portraying a woman reborn with a liberated mindset free from societal pressures:\n\nIt's such a fairy tale, and a metaphor—clearly, this can't actually happen—but the idea that you could start anew as a woman, as this body that's already formed, and see everything for the first time and try to understand the nature of sexuality, or power, or money or choice, the ability to make choices and live by your own rules and not society's—I thought that was a really fascinating world to go into.\n\nStone especially appreciated Bella's lack of shame:\n\nEven though Bella has obviously been through trauma in her life, it just isn't there for her now. She was the most joyous character in the world to play, because she has no shame about anything. She's new, you know? I've never had to build a character before that didn't have things that had happened to them or had been put on them by society throughout their lives. It was an extremely freeing experience to be her.[10]\n\nYoussef said that to prepare for their roles, he and Dafoe attended mortician school. Reflecting on the \"experimental theater games\" Lanthimos assigned the cast before filming, Dafoe said, \"You're very patient with everyone, and everyone's patient with you. They need to be confident in what they're doing, because what we're doing is quite risky. It's not a normal film.\"[19] Dafoe spent six hours each day in the hair and makeup department—four hours getting extensive prosthetics applied to his face at the start of the day and two hours to get it all removed at the end.[21]\n\nDiscussing the male characterizations, Lanthimos acknowledged that while each male character was different and had his own motivation, they all reflected male attitudes typical of the story's Victorian setting. He said:\n\nThere are variations, I guess, but in this film, there's a general tendency to try to control [Bella]—even if it's done in a caring or subtle way, in the way that a parent might or that [Dafoe's character] Baxter does, or just being infatuated in the way that Ramy is. You know, being a nice man deep down, but still having the characteristics of a man of that era.\n\nStone also said that \"the more agency Bella gets, the more she learns and grows, the more it drives these men insane. The more she has an opinion and her own wants and needs and all of that, it makes them crazy; they want her to stay this sort of pure thing.\"[10]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Hungary, beginning in August 2021 at Origo Studios in Budapest[22] and wrapping that December.[23] It is the first feature film to be partially shot on Kodak's 35mm Ektachrome color reversal motion picture film stock since its revival in 2018.[24]\n\n### Influences\n\nAccording to cinematographer Robbie Ryan, Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film Bram Stoker's Dracula served as the main source of inspiration to everyone making the picture.[25] Other films that served as influences were Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's Black Narcissus (1947), Federico Fellini's And The Ship Sails On (1983), and several films by Roy Andersson.[26]\n\n### Costumes\n\nSome of the film's costumes in an exhibit at the Benaki Museum, Athens.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLanthimos worked closely with costume designer Holly Waddington to reflect Bella's growth and development through her wardrobe, from the more puffy silhouettes of her childlike era to the nearly corseted gown she wears at the film's climax.[27][28][29] Stone elaborated on Bella's growth as reflected through her costumes, noting how at the beginning of the story she dresses in more traditional clothing and dresses more bizarrely as she transforms. She said:\n\nI loved that element of, how would Bella put clothing together with the way her mind works at this point? At the end, there are these very military-looking dresses that look like nothing you've seen Bella wear; things are much more form-fitting and constrained, but that's because she's come to a place where she's grown and decided who she is and what she's going to do. She's not assimilating, necessarily, but there's just more structure there.[10]\n\n### Music\n\nPoor Things was the first film scored by the pop musician Jerskin Fendrix. Milan Records released the soundtrack album in conjunction with the film's release date, December 8, 2023. Two singles, \"Bella\" and \"Lisbon\", were released on November 14.[30]\n\n## Genre\n\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called Poor Things \"genre-defying\".[5] Critics have described its genre as a sex comedy, gothic comedy, black comedy, and an absurdist comedy.[31][32][5] Some noted steampunk elements in the visual design.[33][8][34][35]\n\n## Release\n\nPoor Things had its world premiere at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2023,[36] and also screened at the Telluride Film Festival,[37] the New York Film Festival,[38] the BFI London Film Festival,[39] the Busan International Film Festival,[40] and the Sitges Film Festival.[41] The film had a limited theatrical release by Searchlight Pictures in the United States on December 8, 2023, and began a wide release on December 22, 2023.[42][43] It was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom on January 12, 2024.[44] It was previously scheduled to be released on September 8, 2023,[45][46] but was delayed by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[42]\n\n### Home media\n\nPoor Things was released on digital platforms on February 27, 2024,[47] and became available for streaming on Hulu in the U.S. on March 7[48] and on Disney+ in Canada the same day.[49] The film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and DVD on March 12.[47]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nPoor Things grossed $34.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $82.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $117.2 million.[3][4]\n\nIn its limited opening weekend, it made $644,000 from nine theaters, a per-venue average of $71,556 (the third-best of 2023).[50] Expanding to 82 theaters the following weekend, it made $2.2 million, finishing 10th.[51] In its third weekend it made $2.4 million from 800 theaters, and a total of $3.4 million over the four-day Christmas frame.[52] Following its 11 Oscar nominations, it expanded from 900 theaters to 2,300 in its eighth week of release and made $3.08 million, an increase of 43% from the previous weekend.[53] The next weekend it made $2.2 million.[54]\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  garnered critical acclaim for their performances and earned  nominations for  and , with Stone winning.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 377 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Wildly imaginative and exhilaratingly over the top, Poor Things is a bizarre, brilliant tour de force for director Yorgos Lanthimos and star Emma Stone.\"[55] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while 68% of those polled by PostTrak called the film \"excellent\", with 75% saying they would definitely recommend it.[50] Glamour wrote that the film \"received widespread critical acclaim following its world premiere\" and that Stone was \"praised for her hilariously bold and fearless sex scenes\" in it.[57]\n\nStephanie Zacharek of Time wrote that Poor Things is \"Lanthimos' finest film so far, a strange, gorgeous-looking picture that extends generosity both to its characters and the audience\". She called Stone's performance \"wonderful—vital, exploratory, almost lunar in its perfect oddness\".[58] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it a \"virtuoso comic epic\" and added that Stone had given a \"hilarious, beyond-next-level performance\".[59] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter termed it \"an insanely enjoyable fairy tale\", adding that Stone \"gorges on it in a fearless performance that traces an expansive arc most actors could only dream about\".[5] Variety's Guy Lodge also wrote that the film \"rests on a single astonishing performance by Stone\".[60]\n\nBBC Culture's Nicholas Barber found the film \"outrageous and hilarious\", comparing it to the work of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam. The review also noted that the novel's realistic 19th-century setting had been changed to a fantastical \"steam-punk wonderland\", and that some of its satirical humor and most of its socialist and feminist themes had been toned down.[61] Reviews by The Guardian,[59] Variety[60] and Entertainment Weekly[62] also emphasize the setting's steampunk elements. Manohla Dargis, chief critic of The New York Times, was not as impressed. She felt the story became more \"monotonal, flat and dull\" over time, writing that the movie's \"design is rich, its ideas thin. … It isn't long into Poor Things that you start to feel as if you were being bullied into admiring a film that's so deeply self-satisfied there really isn't room for the two of you\". But Dargis too lauded Stone's acting.[63]\n\nFilmmakers such as A. V. Rockwell, Joe Dante, Chloe Domont, Robert Eggers, Kitty Green, Bill Hader, Chad Hartigan, Matt Johnson, Zoe Lister-Jones, James Ponsoldt and Jeff Rowe also praised the film.[64]\n\nRamin Setoodeh and Zack Sharf in Variety wrote, \"Not everyone loved Poor Things. A stream of [Venice] theatergoers bolted for the exit during some of the racier scenes.\"[65] Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \"a 141-minute mistake\", writing, \"Worst of all, it's dishonest. It purports to be a feminist document, but it defines a woman's autonomy as the ability to be exploited and not care. ... What version of feminism are these guys—Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara—trying to sell us here?\"[66] Film critic Scott Mantz applauded LaSalle's post, finding the film \"a seriously misguided take on female empowerment\", though he praised the film's ambition and production values.[67]\n\nAngelica Jade Bastién of Vulture warned readers, \"This isn't a sincere treatise on female sexuality, it's a dark comedy for people who carry around an NPR tote bag\", and criticized the film for failing to take a \"sincere interest in the interior conflicts\" of its protagonist. Bastién identified the decision to make Bella Baxter mentally a child as the \"primary failure of Poor Things' sex scenes\", citing Bella's depiction as an example of the \"born sexy yesterday\" trope. \"In many ways\", she wrote, \"the film demonstrates the limits of the modern cis-male auteur's vision for and about women—particularly their sexual selves.\" Praise was saved for Holly Waddington's costuming, which Bastién called \"the greatest triumph of the film\".[68]\n\nThe film has been subject to scrutiny in Gray's native Scotland due to its seeming disregard for the source material and its Scottish roots,[69] with online documentary channel Ossian presenting a portrayal of the true origins of Poor Things and its Scottish setting.[70] Those closest to Gray have suggested that Lanthimos's interpretation of the source material was something Gray agreed to in the early 2010s, when contractual terms for a screenplay were drawn up.[71]\n\n### Accolades\n\nPoor Things won the Golden Lion at the 80th Venice International Film Festival.[72] At the 96th Academy Awards, it received 11 nominations, including Best Picture, and won 4 awards, including Best Actress for Stone.[73][74] At the 81st Golden Globe Awards, it received seven nominations and won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Stone.[75][76] At the 29th Critics' Choice Awards, it received 13 nominations, winning for Best Actress.[77][78] It received 11 nominations at the 77th British Academy Film Awards and won 5 awards, including for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[79][80] The American Film Institute and the National Board of Review named Poor Things one of 10 best films of the year.[81][82]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ The film has been referenced as a \"genre-defying\" piece of work,[5] with critics labeling it a sex comedy, black comedy and absurdist comedy, and noting its steampunk-like visual design. See the corresponding section of this article for further information regarding the film's genre.\n- ^ The period of the film is \"difficult to pin\"[8] as various futuristic and fantasy elements are included in the cityscapes of Lisbon and Alexandria.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Poor Things (18)\".

Godwin reveals that her body is that of a woman who was pregnant and committed suicide by leaping off a bridge; Godwin replaced the woman's brain with that of the fetus, giving her an infant's mind, and named her Bella Baxter.\n        </Plot>\n        <Plot>\n            As weeks pass, Bella's vocabulary improves and she exhibits childlike wonder at the world. With Godwin's encouragement, Max falls in love with Bella and proposes marriage. Bella accepts, but soon discovers masturbation and sexual pleasure, leading her to run off with Duncan Wedderburn, a debauched lawyer, to Lisbon. There, they have near-constant intercourse as Bella lives purely for pleasure.\n        </Plot>\n        <Plot>\n            As Bella becomes difficult for Duncan to control, he smuggles her onto a cruise ship, where she befriends two passengers who open her mind to philosophy. Duncan attempts to stunt her growth to no avail, and indulges in drinking and gambling. During a stop at Alexandria, Bella witnesses the suffering of the poor and becomes distraught. Wishing to help them, she entrusts Duncan's winnings to unscrupulous members of the crew, who falsely promise to give it to them.\n        </Plot>\n        <Plot>\n            Unable to afford the rest of the trip, Bella and Duncan are dropped off at Marseille and make their way to Paris, penniless. Seeking money and accommodation, Bella begins working at a brothel. Enraged, Duncan breaks down, and Bella abandons him. At the brothel, she comes under the tutelage of Madame Swiney and begins a relationship with fellow prostitute Toinette, who introduces her to socialism.\n        </Plot>\n        <Plot>\n            Now terminally ill, Godwin asks Max to bring Bella to him. Max finds her after tracking down Duncan, who has been institutionalized. Back in London, Bella reconciles with Godwin and renews her plans to marry Max, but their wedding is interrupted by Duncan and General Alfie Blessington. Alfie, addressing Bella as Victoria, declares that they were married before her disappearance and that he has come to reclaim her.\n        </Plot>\n        <Plot>\n            Bella leaves Max to learn of her past life, but discovers Alfie's violent and sadistic nature. Bella realizes that she was Victoria, and that she killed herself to escape Alfie. Alfie confines Bella to his mansion and tells her that he plans to have her clitoris removed and impregnate her, threatening her with a gun and demanding she drink a sedative. She tosses the sedative in his face. Alfie accidentally shoots himself in the foot and passes out.\n        </Plot>\n        <Plot>\n            Bella returns to Godwin's house and, with Max's help, transplants a goat's brain into Alfie's head. Godwin dies peacefully with Bella and Max at his side. Bella, Max, and Toinette begin a new life in Godwin's house, while Alfie eats grass happily.\n        </Plot>\n    </Synopsis>\n</PoorThings>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly structuring it according to the specified attributes, making it more readable and accessible.

The sequel to Despicable Me 3 (2017), it is the fourth main installment and sixth overall entry in the Despicable Me franchise. The film was directed by Chris Renaud, co-directed by Patrick Delage, produced by Chris Meledandri and Brett Hoffman, and written by Mike White and Ken Daurio. It stars the voices of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Pierre Coffin, Joey King, Miranda Cosgrove, Stephen Colbert, Sofía Vergara, Steve Coogan, Renaud, Madison Polan, Dana Gaier, Chloe Fineman, and Will Ferrell. The film sees reformed supervillain and secret agent Gru relocate his family to a safe house when his old rival Maxime Le Mal seeks revenge. Subplots deal with Gru's family adjusting to their new lives, teenage neighbor Poppy Prescott trying to follow in Gru's villainous footsteps, and a group of Gru's Minions becoming superheroes.\n\nDevelopment on a fourth main Despicable Me film began in September 2017. It was officially confirmed in February 2022, with Renaud, Delage, and White attached as director, co-director, and writer, respectively. Production was underway by June 2022. Most of the main voice cast was announced in January 2024, with Hoffman and Daurio revealed as co-producer and co-writer, respectively. Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams returned from previous installments to compose the score and write original songs and themes, respectively.\n\nDespicable Me 4 debuted at the Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City on June 9, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 3. Despite mixed reviews, the film continued the franchise's streak of box-office successes, grossing $971 million worldwide against a budget of $100 million, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2024.\n\n## Plot\n\nUndercover Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Gru attends a class reunion at his former high school Lycée Pas Bon where he reunites with Maxime Le Mal, a former classmate of his who has a feud with Gru for \"stealing\" his talent show act. During the ceremony, Maxime reveals he has enhanced himself with cockroach body parts, and Gru has him arrested by the AVL. Helped by his girlfriend Valentina, Maxime escapes prison and reveals his new invention, a gun that transforms people into cockroach hybrids, which he plans to use specifically on Gru's infant son Gru Jr., who despises his father.\n\nDays later, Silas Ramsbottom visits the Gru household to inform them that Maxime has escaped and that the AVL will have to relocate the Gru family to a safe house in another town under new identities. Meanwhile, the AVL takes in the Minions. Silas selects five of them to be augmented with superpowers under a new initiative called the Mega Minions. However, the initiative was called off after the group unintentionally caused significant collateral damage in a nearby city.\n\nIn their new well-off residential town, Gru and his family meet their new neighbors, the Prescotts, and their teenage daughter Poppy. Poppy, an aspiring villain, recognizes Gru from his former career as a villain and threatens to blow his cover unless he helps her pull a heist to steal Lycée Pas Bon's honey badger mascot Lenny. Gru and Poppy successfully steal Lenny from the school, unaware that Lenny's collar contains a tracker. The school's principal Übelschlecht identifies Gru via security camera footage and contacts Maxime to inform him about Gru's whereabouts using Lenny's collar.\n\nThe next day, while Gru and Lucy are away at tennis practice, principal Übelschlecht visits the safe house to interrogate the girls about Gru. Gru and Lucy rush back home after being alerted by Margo and fight Übelschlecht. Lucy also signals the AVL who calls the Mega Minions out of retirement to stop Maxime. In the havoc, however, Gru Jr. leaves the house and is spotted by Maxime and Valentina, who kidnap him.\n\nWith the help of Poppy, Gru meets up with Maxime at a nearby building where he reveals he has transformed Gru Jr. into a human-cockroach hybrid and fights him off. Gru's words to his son manage to break Gru Jr. free from his brainwashing and attacks Maxime instead. Maxime falls to the ground after getting punched by Gru, where he is further squashed by the Mega Minions, who arrive in turn.\n\nGru, his family, and the Minions return to their original home, where Dr. Nefario reverses Gru Jr.'s transformation. Sometime later, Gru visits Maxime in prison to talk and settle their differences. The pair then puts on a performance of \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" at an AVL prison for the prisoners, attended by villains from the past.\n\n## Voice cast\n\n- Steve Carell as Gru, a former supervillain turned Anti-Villain League agent who is Margo, Edith, and Agnes' adoptive father, the biological father of Gru Jr., and Lucy's husband, who poses as \"Chet Cunningham Sr.\", a solar panel salesman.\n- Kristen Wiig as Lucy Wilde, an Anti-Villain League agent, Gru's wife and adoptive mother to Margo, Edith, and Agnes, and Gru Jr.'s biological mother, who poses as \"Blanche Cunningham\", a hairdresser.\n- Will Ferrell as Maxime Le Mal, a French-accented, cockroach-themed supervillain who was an old highschool rival of Gru and seeks revenge against him and his family\n- Joey King as Poppy Prescott, an aspiring supervillainess who has admired Gru for a long time, Perry and Patsy's daughter and Gru's new neighbor in Mayflower[6]\n- Sofía Vergara as Valentina, Maxime's femme fatale girlfriend who owns a pet Maltese dog\n- Stephen Colbert as Perry Prescott, Gru's arrogant new neighbor in Mayflower and Poppy's father who owns a line of automobile dealerships[6]\n- Chloe Fineman as Patsy Prescott, Poppy's Texan-accented mother[6]\n- Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Gru and Lucy's oldest adopted daughter, who poses as \"Bree Cunningham\"\n- Steve Coogan as Silas Ramsbottom, the previously retired director of the Anti-Villain League\n- Pierre Coffin as the Minions, the yellow henchmen of Gru, most of whom later get jobs at the Anti-Villain League as agents and superheroes\n- Dana Gaier as Edith, Gru and Lucy's middle adopted daughter, who poses as \"Blair Cunningham\"\n- Madison Polan as Agnes, Gru and Lucy's youngest adopted daughter, who poses as \"Britney Cunningham\".

Movie (2023) executive producer Brett Hoffman and Daurio had been added as co-producer and co-writer, respectively.[15]\n\n### Writing\n\nWhite wrote the screenplay of Despicable Me 4 with Daurio, who joined him later in the production.[16] The filmmakers aimed to delve deeper into the film's many aspects to have a \"proper balance\" in the story, since Minions: The Rise of Gru was delayed in July 2022. Renaud and White had ideas for the narrative including Gru and his family being forced into witness protection and Gru's rogue rival from high school; they were intended to foster a connection with the audience, depending on each subplot focus.[17][18]\n\nAn abandoned Mega Minions idea from Despicable Me 2 (2013) was resurrected for Despicable Me 4. The filmmakers researched initial concepts of the idea,[19] taking inspiration from the Marvel Comics team Fantastic Four and the Pixar film The Incredibles (2004).[20][21] To make the Mega Minions unique from the majority of media featuring superheroes, Renaud incorporated incompetent and the Minions' characteristics into the Mega Minions.[16]\n\n### Casting\n\nIn January 2024, it was announced that Carell, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Pierre Coffin, and Steve Coogan would return to reprise their respective roles as Gru, Lucy Wilde, Margo, Edith, the Minions, and Silas Ramsbottom, while Will Ferrell, Joey King, Sofía Vergara, Stephen Colbert, Chloe Fineman, and Madison Polan (replacing Nev Scharrel who in turn replaced Elsie Fisher) would join the voice cast, respectively voicing Maxime Le Mal, Poppy Prescott, Valentina, Perry Prescott, Patsy Prescott, and Agnes.[22][23]\n\n### Animation\n\nAccording to Renaud, some of the characters who appeared in previous films had their character rigs and surfaces updated for this film. Fred McDade, who had not appeared since the second film, was recreated from scratch, as his character model was too old. The sequence where Poppy plays with an arcade machine originally started out as an animation test for the character, but the filmmakers liked the sequence so much that it was added to the final cut of the film.[14]\n\n## Music\n\nIn March 2024, Heitor Pereira was announced to be composing the film's score, returning from the previous installments.[24] Pharrell Williams was also confirmed to be returning to co-compose the score with Pereira as well as to write new songs.[25] The original soundtrack was released on June 27, 2024, by Back Lot Music.[26]\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on January 28, 2024, during the 2023–24 NFL playoff championship games.[27] The trailer features the songs \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" by Guns N' Roses and \"Maneater\" by Hall &amp; Oates, as well as in television showings, \"Through the Fire and Flames\" by DragonForce. CBR reported that the trailer showcased \"the struggles of welcoming in a new member of the Gru family\" and included the debut of Will Ferrell's Maxime Le Mal.[22] Screen Rant's Brennan Klein observed that Gru's tumultuous relationship with his son, Gru Jr., contrasted with the good relationship with his adopted daughters.[28] An additional trailer was revealed on February 11 during Super Bowl LVIII, being narrated by Jon Hamm, who previously voiced Herb Overkill in the 2015 spin-off film Minions, and featuring cameos by Ferrell and Steve Carell. Ryan Gajewski of The Hollywood Reporter said the trailer appeared to \"tout the benefits of modern technology but feature strange images supposedly generated by AI,\" enjoying the Renaissance-era-inspired poses of Ferrell and Carell in the trailer.[29] On April 10, at CinemaCon, Universal displayed a clip of Gru and Poppy trying to steal a honey badger.[30] Brennan Kline of Screen Rant appreciated that the clip solidified the \"important element\" of Gru's domestic family man status in the sequel.[31]\n\nThe second trailer was released on May 7, 2024.[32] Writing for TheWrap, Drew Taylor called the trailer \"Minions-heavy\" and pointed out one of Pharrell Williams' new original songs featured in the trailer.[33] Collider noted the \"devastating consequences\" of enlisting a small group of Minion volunteers for an experiment that gave them superpowers. Journalist Diego Peralta pointed out a sequence in which one of the super-powered minions destroys a part of their base with laser vision and said that villains Maxime and Valentina \"are more dangerous than any threat Gru has faced before.\"[34]\n\nOn June 8, 2024, Illumination released a parody teaser for the film in which Steve Carell announces the Megaverse, a parody of shared universes such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe, by claiming that Illumination would release 100 years' worth of films, television series, and stage productions starring the Mega Minions.[35] Illumination also published a website for the Megaverse.[36] Some of the fake productions noted on the website include Mega Minions: The Tax Write-Off and an untitled Mega Minions spin-off series with a \"story to be determined based on rigorous market testing and ad hoc decision-making.\"[36] The stunt referenced several current Hollywood affairs such as the cancellation of Warner Bros. films like Batgirl, Scoob! Holiday Haunt and Coyote vs. Acme and the failure of the 2022 DCEU film Black Adam, as well as the mixed reception to Disney's live-action remakes of their classic animated films and many of Marvel's recent productions, such as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Secret Invasion.[35]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nDespicable Me 4 debuted at the Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City on June 9, 2024,[37] followed by a premiere on June 13, at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival.[38] The film was released in the United States on July 3.[11]\n\n### Home media\n\nUniversal Pictures Home Entertainment released Despicable Me 4 for digital download on September 10, 2024, and on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on September 24. Physical copies contain behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, recreational activities, an overview of the franchise's adversaries, and two short films—Game Over and Over and Benny's Birthday.[39]\n\nThe film was made available to stream on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service on October 31, 2024.[40] As part of their 18-month deal with Netflix, the film is streaming on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, before moving to Netflix for the next ten beginning on February 28, 2025.[41][42][43]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nDespicable Me 4 grossed $361 million in the United States and Canada, and $610 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $971 million.[4][5]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Despicable Me 4 was projected to gross $100–125 million from 4,030 theaters in its five-day opening weekend.[44][45] The film made $27 million on its first day and $20.4 million on its second.[46][47] It went on to debut to $75 million over the traditional three-day weekend, along with a total five-day gross of $122.6 million, topping the box office.[48] The film made $43.6 million the following weekend, remaining in first place.[49] In its third weekend the film made $24.4 million, finishing in second behind newcomer Twisters, and then made $14.6 million in its fourth weekend, finishing in third behind Twisters and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.[50][51]\n\nInternationally the film opened in different countries with different dates, with Australia being the earliest country to release it. The film opened big in multiple countries, and in some it settled franchise records, though in many countries that it opened prior to its US release date, the film opened second behind Inside Out 2, slowing its international climb.[52]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 164 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Fast paced and teeming with slapstick gags, Despicable Me 4 is as overstuffed as a piñata but full of enough candy to give audiences an enjoyable sugar rush.\"[53] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[54] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale (same as the first two films), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film an 82% positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend it.[47]\n\nVariety admitted the film is entertaining but found the plot overcrowded with useless characters: \"One thing is absolutely certain: We haven't seen the last of these characters, even if we might prefer that a few of them sit out the next sequel—like the Mega Minions, who aren't nearly as cute as they sound.\"[55] A similar appraisal can be found in Screen Rant,[56] as well as in The Hollywood Reporter, observing, for example, the underdeveloped role of the villain in the midst of the various plot lines: \"Running a brisk 95 minutes, Despicable Me 4 doesn't leave enough time for Maxime to enact his plans in a way that packs an emotional punch.\"[57] ABC News commented: \"Should a review of a 'Despicable Me' movie be a thoughtful analysis or just a list of the funny stuff the Minions do in it? As much as I might believe in the value of film criticism, I kind of suspect that even the finest points of assessment would be dismantled about as fast as a Minion can say 'Bello!'\"[58]\n\n### Accolades\n\nDespicable Me 4's theme song \"Double Life\" received a nomination for Original Song in an Animated Film at the 15th Hollywood Music in Media Awards.[59] Habib Louati won Outstanding Achievement for Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production at the 52nd Annie Awards.[60] The film was nominated for Best Animated Film at the 52nd Saturn Awards and Best Movie for Families at the 2025 Movieguide Awards.[61][62][63]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c Gyarkye, Lovia (June 28, 2024). \"'Despicable Me 4' Review: Gru's Family Grows in Illumination Animation That Serves Up Familiar Antics\".

It stars Cate Blanchett as Lillith, an outlaw who forms an alliance with a team of misfits to find the missing daughter of the most powerful man in the universe.[4] The ensemble cast also features Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Edgar Ramirez, Ariana Greenblatt, Florian Munteanu, Gina Gershon, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nThe film was announced in August 2015, with Lionsgate Films developing it with Ari and Avi Arad producing, and Leigh Whannell in talks to direct. By February 2020, Erik Feig had joined as a producer and Roth was attached to direct from a screenplay by Craig Mazin. Casting took place from May 2020 to April 2021, with Blanchett cast first and others the following year. Principal photography began in April 2021 in Budapest, Hungary, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and wrapped in June. Two weeks of reshoots took place in early 2023, directed by Tim Miller due to Roth's commitments to Thanksgiving. That June, Mazin removed his name from the project and was replaced by Joe Crombie.\n\nBorderlands premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on August 6, 2024, and was released in the United States by Lionsgate on August 9. The film received negative reviews. Analysts considered it to be a box-office bomb, grossing $33 million worldwide against a production budget of $110–120 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nOn the planet of Pandora, Roland, a mercenary soldier apparently gone rogue, kidnaps teenager Tiny Tina with the help of Krieg, a \"Psycho\" who was institutionalized in the same facility. Meanwhile, on another planet, bounty hunter Lilith is contacted by Atlas, a powerful corporate magnate. He convinces her to rescue Tina, his daughter. Lilith returns to Pandora, her home planet, for the first time since she was a child. With the help of Claptrap, a robot that was mysteriously programmed to wait for her on Pandora, she locates Tina.\n\nAfter realizing that Atlas wants his daughter back against her will, Lilith teams up with Roland and Krieg when they are attacked by the Crimson Lance, the private army of Atlas. Lilith is informed that Tina was genetically engineered with biological material from the Eridians, the ancient race that once inhabited Pandora, and that Atlas believes only she can open the Vault where the secrets of the lost civilization's advanced technology are kept.\n\nWith the help of Lilith's estranged foster mother, Dr. Patricia Tannis, they locate the key to open the Vault in an underground maze occupied by a tribe of Psychos. They manage to take the key to the surface. Lilith destroys the device Atlas entrusted her with to signal when she had rescued Tina, and he immediately communicates with her via robotic drone, explaining that he still wants the girl. Tina overhears the end of the conversation and assumes that Lilith has betrayed her. She throws a grenade at Lilith, leaving her unconscious. When Lilith recovers, Claptrap unknowingly plays a holographic message for her, recorded by her mother.\n\nThe next day, without Lilith and Claptrap, the team find the Vault only to realize that Atlas is waiting for them, and they fight off his men. However, Tina is unable to open the Vault. Lilith appears and explains that she is the one who can do it, being an Eridian known as the Firehawk. Atlas threatens to kill Tina if Lilith does not open the Vault. She obeys but, with Tina's help, traps Atlas inside, where a creature drags him away. The group celebrates their survival.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Cate Blanchett as Lilith[5]\n- Kevin Hart as Roland Greaves[6]\n- Jack Black as the voice of Claptrap[7]\n- Edgar Ramírez as Deukalian Atlas[8]\n- Ariana Greenblatt as Tiny Tina[9]\n- Florian Munteanu as Krieg[10]\n- Gina Gershon as Mad Moxxi[11]\n- Jamie Lee Curtis as Patricia Tannis[12]\n- Haley Bennett as Lilith's mom[13]\n- Bobby Lee as Larry[11]\n- Olivier Richters as Krom[14]\n- Janina Gavankar as Commander Knoxx[15]\n- Benjamin Byron Davis as Marcus[11]\n- Harry Ford as Middleman\n- Paula Andrea Placido as Quinn\n- Steven Boyer as Scooter[11]\n- Ryann Redmond as Ellie[11]\n\nAdditionally, Penn Jillette, who voiced Pain in the video game Borderlands 3 (2019), was going to have a cameo in the film as a preacher overseeing a wedding;[16] this scene was cut from the final version.[17] Scenes with Cheyenne Jackson as Wainwright Jakobs and Charles Babalola as Alistair Hammerlock were also cut.[18]\n\n## Production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWriter and director  (left).  (right) took over directing duties during reshoots.\n\nIn 2011, Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford had his first conversation about a possible film adaptation of Borderlands with producers Avi and Ari Arad of Arad Productions.[19] Pitchford was convinced that a film adaption would work after the release of Tales from the Borderlands.[20] He later planned on starting a Borderlands cinematic universe.[21] In May 2015, Leigh Whannell was in talks with Lionsgate to write and direct an adaptation of the video game series.[22] The film was officially announced in August 2015; however, Whannell's involvement was left omitted.[23]\n\nEli Roth stated that his French bulldog pooping gave him inspiration while pitching the film. \"I have to look away because she gets really shy. But one day I filmed her. She had that shy look on her face and I was like, 'That's Claptrap.'\" A scene of Claptrap pooping was included in the final film.[24]\n\nAaron Berg was tapped to pen an R-rated take on the material in April 2016.[25] By June 2018, Oren Uziel assumed scripting duties from Berg.[26][27] On February 20, 2020, Lionsgate announced that Roth was attached to direct the film from a screenplay written by Craig Mazin, with Erik Feig joining as producer through his production company Picturestart.[28][29] By April 2021, Mazin's script had been rewritten by Juel Taylor and Tony Rettenmaier; and again by Roth.[30] A plot synopsis was released in April.[31]\n\nCate Blanchett was cast as Lilith in May 2020.[5][32] Speaking of her decision to join the project, Blanchett said: \"The gun-slinging stuff was so much fun. I got really absorbed in that whole world. I think there also may have been a little Covid madness—I was spending a lot of time in the garden, using the chainsaw a little too freely. My husband said, 'This film could save your life'.\"[33] Kevin Hart trained with United States Navy SEALs prior to auditioning for the role of Roland.[34] The rest of the ensemble cast was announced between January and April 2021.[6][11] Roth stated that he wanted to include cosplayers in the film as extras and kill them off.[35]\n\nFilming began on April 1, 2021, in Budapest, Hungary, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and wrapped on June 22.[36][37][38] On June 4, 2021, first-look images of the cast were released, with black-and-white images obscuring all but the cast's silhouettes.[39] In January 2023, it was announced the film would be going through two weeks of reshoots directed by Tim Miller, due to Roth's commitments to Thanksgiving.[40] Zak Olkewicz wrote new pages for Miller.[41] In June 2023, Mazin removed his name from the project, replaced by Joe Crombie; Mazin has denied reports that Crombie was his pseudonym.[42] Additional literary material was credited to Berg, Uziel, Taylor, Rettenmaier, Olkewicz, Chris Bremner, and Sam Levinson.[43] Steve Jablonsky composed the film's score after replacing Nathan Barr.[44][45]\n\nJimmy O'Dee, the stunt coordinator for the film, stated that scenes depicting heads being blown up and feet being cut off were cut to maintain a PG-13 rating.[46]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nBorderlands was initially planned to be released in 2022.[47][48] It premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on August 6, 2024.[49] It was theatrically released in the United States by Lionsgate Films on August 9, 2024.[50] The film cost $110–120 million to produce, and Lionsgate spent $30 million on print and advertising. International pre-sales reportedly covered 60% of production costs.[51] Sales of Borderlands 3 on Steam rose after the film's release and the concurrent player amount doubled from around 6,000 to a peak of 12,231.[52]\n\n### Home media\n\nOn August 18, 2024, Lionsgate Home Entertainment announced that Borderlands would be released on Digital HD and platforms on August 30, 2024.[53] The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 22, 2024.[54]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nBorderlands grossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $17.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33 million.[2][3] Following its opening weekend, Deadline Hollywood reported the film would likely lose the studio $20–30 million.[55]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Borderlands was released alongside It Ends with Us and Cuckoo, and was projected to gross $8–16 million from 3,125 theaters in its opening weekend.[51][56][57] The film made $4 million on its first day, including an estimated $1.32 million from Thursday previews.[55] It ended up debuting with $8.6 million, finishing in fourth.[58] It made $2.4 million in its second weekend.[59]\n\nStrauss Zelnick, CEO of Take Two Interactive and the parent company of Gearbox, said in November 2024, \"Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalogue sales\" in terms of the video game series, but also stated they will remain selective about future video game film adaptions.[60]\n\n### Critical response\n\nBorderlands received negative reviews from critics.[61][62][63] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 10% of 165 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Glitching out in every department, Borderlands is balderdash.\"[64] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 26 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.[65] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 46% positive score, with 31% saying they would definitely recommend it.[55]\n\nThe Guardian called the film \"janky\" and a \"juvenile and derivative adaptation\"[66] while Variety found it was a \"generic gaming adaptation that deprives audiences of the most valuable ingredient of its source: surprise.\"[67] The Independent said it was a \"total disaster\"[68] while Rolling Stone wondered if Borderlands was the worst video game movie ever.[69] The Evening Standard suggested it was the worst film of the year.[70] PC Gamer compared Borderlands to numerous other video game movie adaptations: \"You might have heard the claim that this is a righting of the scale, … [to] remind us that good adaptations are the exception, not the rule. We needed a new Super Mario Bros. (1993). We didn't get one. Borderlands cannot hold a candle to Super Mario Bros. It is not interestingly bad. ... It has no cheesy, thwarted ambition to redeem it. It never becomes more than a waste of a hundred minutes.\"[71]\n\nBlanchett's performance was praised by Tim Grierson of Screen Daily, who contrasted it with the rest of the ensemble cast: \"Not many in the starry ensemble shine. Vivid character actors like Gina Gershon and Jamie Lee Curtis ... are trapped in stale genre types. Even the potentially intriguing change-of-pace performances—such as Hart in a far more sombre turn than we expect from the explosive comedian—flatline.\"[72] Among the more positive reviews, MovieWeb wrote, \"Roth displays his cinematic prowess with solid combat scenes. Munteanu's Krieg is a beast and a half, twisting baddies into human pretzels with unabashed glee. The violence is brutal but not graphically disturbing ... It's stunning to see a Roth film without even a hint of blood. The producers made a business calculation to avoid the R-rating and allow children who also enjoy the games to see the film. Die-hard Roth fans expecting his trademark gruesome torture should sit this one out.\"[73]\n\nIt is considered one of the worst films of 2024 by Metacritic,[74] Letterboxd,[75] Digital Trends,[76] Screen Crush[77] and The Times-Tribune.[78] Screen Rant wrote that the script, action sequences, humor, PG-13 rating, unoriginality, underdeveloped characters, and lack of chemistry were criticized; though some praised Blanchett's performance.[79]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                          | Date of ceremony    | Category                          | Recipient(s)                                             | Result    | Ref.                |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| Costume Designers Guild Awards | February 6, 2025    | Excellence in Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film | Daniel Orlandi                                           | Nominated | [80]                |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards        | February 28, 2025   | Worst Picture                     | Avi Arad, Ari Arad, and Erik Feig                        | Nominated | [81] [82] [83] [84] |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards        | February 28, 2025   | Worst Director                    | Eli Roth                                                 | Nominated | [81] [82] [83] [84] |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards        | February 28, 2025   | Worst Actress                     | Cate Blanchett                                           | Nominated | [81] [82] [83] [84] |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards        | February 28, 2025   | Worst Supporting Actor            | Jack Black                                               | Nominated | [81] [82] [83] [84] |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards        | February 28, 2025   | Worst Supporting Actor            | Kevin Hart                                               | Nominated | [81] [82] [83] [84] |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards        | February 28, 2025   | Worst Screen Combo                | Any two obnoxious characters (but especially Jack Black) | Nominated | [81] [82] [83] [84] |\n| Golden Trailer Awards          | May 30, 2024        | Best Fantasy/Adventure            | \"Make It Rain\" (Lionsgate Films / Create)                | Nominated | [85] [86]           |\n| Golden Trailer Awards          | May 30, 2024        | Best Motion/Title Graphics        | \"Make It Rain\" (Lionsgate Films / Create)                | Won       | [85] [86]           |\n| Queerties Awards               | March 20, 2024      | Next Big Thing                    | Borderlands                                              | Nominated | [87]                |\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films based on video games\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Borderlands (12A)\".

He then said he regretted that statement after watching the first Deadpool (2016) and expressed to Ryan his interest in the two characters meeting on the big screen. When asked why he chose to return for this film, he simply said, \"I just wanted to do it, and I felt it in my gut\", adding that he wanted to have the best possible time ever on a movie set together with Ryan Reynolds. Likewise, Reynolds wanted to work alongside Jackman since the first Deadpool film and was saddened when he (Jackman) retired from the role.\n\n- GoofsWhile Wolverine and Deadpool are making their odyssey in the Honda Odyssey, the car's clock jumps ahead three hours during their conversation.\n\n- QuotesDeadpool: I'm about to lose everything that I've ever cared about because that hairy thundercunt from down undercunt finally dies, and he's standing right behind me, isn't he?[turning to Logan] Deadpool: Welcome to the MCU, by the way. You're joining at a bit of a low point.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe closing credits are accompanied by a montage of clips and behind-the-scenes footage from the 20th Century Fox superhero movies (the X-Men franchise, the Fantastic Four films, Daredevil, and Elektra). At the end is the 20th Century Fox logo.\n\n- Alternate versionsIn order to get a release in China, some scenes were edited or removed. The scene where Al asks Deadpool to do cocaine and then lists different names for it was completely cut out. The TVA agents fight scene had most of the blood edited out. When Wolverine kills Sabretooth, his head does not fall off on-screen and when Deadpool picks it up, a wide shot is used. Human Torch's death is shown but only briefly and his body does not melt. The Deadpool corps fight cuts out some parts and removes most of the blood. Sexual words were bleeped out. Only some f words were removed.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited from Thor: The Dark World (2013)\n\n- SoundtracksOnly You (and You Alone) (re-recorded)\nWritten by Buck Ram and Buck Ram (as Ande Rand)\nPerformed by The Platters\nCourtesy of Cleopatra Records\nBy arrangement with The Orchard\n\n### User reviews2.1K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Till you're 90 Wolverine!\n\nHugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. What a fun movie. I like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. It's definitely not taking itself too seriously. There is tons of fun cameos I didn't expect! I normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but I didn't on this occasion and I'm glad I didn't because there was some oh snap moments! It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. They are promoting this movie hard I just watched these two on Hot Ones eating chicken wings They make a dynamic duo. Until your 90 Wolverine ...until your 90 lol.\n\n- omar-d-sheikh\n- Jul 24, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ23\n\n- How long is Deadpool &amp;amp; Wolverine?Powered by Alexa\n- Why is Marvel Studios trying to fold the X-Men into the MCU?

Due to associations with Jewish stereotypes, the character's name was changed to 'Debbie the Dog Mom' in the credits for the digital and DVD/Blu-Ray releases.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Jimmy Kimmel: Chris Pine/Ke Huy Quan/Wallows (2022)\n\n- SoundtracksLife Can Be So Delicious\nWritten by Daniel Kwan, Ryan Lott and Daniel Scheinert\nPerformed by Sunita Mani and Aaron Lazar\n\n### User reviews3.8K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Enough material for 90 minutes\n\nI loved the casting, acting, and plot. CGI doesn't do a lot for me but I didn't mind as it was necessary to advance the story (for once). But 139 minutes? It was already repetitive after an hour or so. One could argue that \"everything and everywhere\" takes time, or that it should take time--even at the expense of clarity and originality--but either way it shouldn't feel like an eternity. All the martial arts and gags were funny somehow even though fairly unoriginal. Nevertheless, I couldn't help but feel the directors lost control of the pacing and rate of revelation--which was glacial. It also felt like the editors were paid by the screen-minute rather than for doing their job, which is to yell at directors and be brutal for the good of the finished product.\n\nIt deserves a 6 for the good stuff, not a 1 for the idiots who kept saying they didn't understand what was going on. It wasn't rocket science, just way too long.\n\n- chrispk-86032\n- Mar 15, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is Everything Everywhere All at Once?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - April 14, 2022 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - A24\n    - Official Instagram\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Mandarin\n    - Cantonese\n- Also known as\n    - Todo En Todas Partes Al Mismo Tiempo\n- Filming locations\n    - 400 National Way, Simi Valley, California, USA(IRS Building)\n- Production companies\n    - A24\n    - IAC Films\n    - AGBO\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $14,300,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $77,191,785\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $501,305\n    - Mar 27, 2022\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $143,412,671\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 19 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - Stereo\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It stars Daveigh Chase and Sanders as the voices of the title characters, with the voices of Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers, Kevin McDonald, Ving Rhames, Jason Scott Lee, Zoe Caldwell, and Kevin Michael Richardson in supporting roles. It was the second of three Disney animated feature films produced primarily at the Florida animation studio in Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida.[5][d]\n\nThe film tells the story of two individuals: an orphaned Hawaiian girl named Lilo Pelekai, who is raised by her struggling older sister, Nani, after their parents' deaths, and the genetically engineered extraterrestrial creature Experiment 626, who Lilo adopts as her \"dog\" and renames \"Stitch\". Stitch, who was designed to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid recapture by an intergalactic federation. They develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of ʻohana, or extended family, causing Stitch to reconsider his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his newfound family together.\n\nThe film is based on an idea by Sanders, who originally conceived Stitch in 1985, and the film's design and aesthetics are based on his personal art style. Stitch was initially at the center of a children's book Sanders had conceptualized, but later abandoned. A feature-length film starring the character entered development in 1997 when Thomas Schumacher, then the president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, approached Sanders with the objective of \"producing the Dumbo for our generation.\" The use of watercolor backgrounds hearkened back to early Disney productions such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The film and its accompanying soundtrack made extensive use of the music of Elvis Presley, while Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\n\nLilo &amp; Stitch premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 16, 2002, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 21. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, humor, charm, and originality. Produced on an $80 million budget and promoted with a marketing campaign that played up its oddities, it was a box-office success, grossing over $273 million worldwide. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards but lost to Spirited Away.[6][7] The film's success made it a highlight of Disney's post-animation renaissance era in the 2000s, spawning a franchise that includes three direct-to-video film sequels and three television series. A live-action adaptation is set to be released in 2025.\n\n## Plot\n\nOn planet Turo, the United Galactic Federation convicts scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba of illegal genetic experimentation; he has created Experiment 626, an aggressive and near-indestructible creature with great learning capabilities. 626 is sentenced to exile on a desert asteroid, but he escapes and hijacks a space cruiser that crash-lands on Kauaʻi, Hawaii, on the planet Earth. Shortly after landing on Earth, 626 is hit by three passing trucks and taken to an animal shelter. The Federation's Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba an early release if he retrieves 626 with the assistance of the council's Earth expert, Agent Pleakley.\n\nOn Kauaʻi, orphaned teenager Nani Pelekai struggles to take care of her lonely, rambunctious younger sister, Lilo, following their parents' death in a car crash. Social worker Cobra Bubbles doubts Nani can be an adequate guardian for Lilo and threatens to place Lilo in foster care if the Pelekais' situation fails to improve. After overhearing Lilo wishing to have a friend, Nani brings her to the animal shelter to adopt a dog. Lilo adopts 626, who is impersonating a dog, and names him \"Stitch\". That night, Stitch causes chaos at the lūʻau where Nani works while trying to avoid capture by Jumba and Pleakley. Nani's boss blames Nani for the chaos, and she is fired. The news of Nani's unemployment reaches Bubbles, who orders Nani to find a new job and tells Lilo to teach Stitch to be a \"model citizen\".\n\nDespite Lilo's attempts to domesticate Stitch, his antics repeatedly ruin Nani's efforts to find a new job. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch go surfing with Nani's former co-worker and friend David, Jumba and Pleakley again attempt to capture Stitch and unintentionally drag Lilo underwater in the process. David rescues Lilo and Stitch, but Bubbles, having observed the mishap, tells Nani he will retrieve Lilo the following morning. Feeling guilty for causing so much trouble, Stitch runs away. The Grand Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley and tasks her second-in-command, Captain Gantu, with capturing Stitch, while Jumba begins hunting Stitch using less covert methods. When David informs Nani of another job opportunity, Nani leaves Lilo at home alone. Jumba and Pleakley chase Stitch back to the Pelekais' house. The ensuing fight between Jumba and Stitch culminates in an explosion that destroys the house.\n\nNani gets the job but frantically returns home after seeing a fire engine driving toward her house. Bubbles arrives to retrieve Lilo. While Bubbles and Nani argue about Lilo's well-being, Lilo runs away into the woods and encounters Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just moments before Gantu captures them both. Stitch manages to escape just as Gantu's ship takes off. Nani confronts Stitch, but Jumba and Pleakley immediately capture him. Nani asks them to save Lilo, but they insist they only have legal authority to capture Stitch. As Nani breaks down, Stitch remembers ʻohana, a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue her. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani board Jumba's spaceship, pursue Gantu and rescue Lilo.\n\nThe Grand Councilwoman arrives to retrieve Stitch herself. She fires Gantu for endangering Lilo and failing to capture Stitch. However, after observing Stitch's civilized behavior and being informed that Lilo legally owns Stitch because she bought him at the animal shelter, the Grand Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live out his exile on Earth and that the Pelekai family has the protection of the United Galactic Federation. Bubbles reveals he is a former CIA agent who had previously met the Grand Councilwoman in Roswell, New Mexico in 1973. Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley, having joined Lilo and Nani's family, rebuild their house with David and Bubbles' help.\n\n## Voice cast\n\n- Daveigh Chase as Lilo Pelekai, an eccentric young Hawaiian girl on the island of Kauaʻi who adopts Stitch as her pet dog.\n- Chris Sanders[b] as Stitch, also known as Experiment 626, a blue koala-like illegal genetic experiment with the ability to create untold chaos.\n- Tia Carrere as Nani Pelekai, Lilo's older sister and legal guardian.\n- Jason Scott Lee as David Kawena, Nani's hapless surfer boyfriend.\n- David Ogden Stiers as Dr. Jumba Jookiba, a Kweltikwan mad scientist employed by Galaxy Defense Industries who created Stitch.\n- Kevin McDonald as Agent Pleakley, a Plorgonarian Galactic Federation agent who acts as the expert of Earth.\n- Ving Rhames as Cobra Bubbles, a social worker in charge of Lilo's welfare and Nani's duties as her guardian.\n- Kevin Michael Richardson as Captain Gantu, the respected but arrogant Shaelik second-in-command of the Galactic Federation.\n- Zoe Caldwell as the Grand Councilwoman, the Grey leader of the Galactic Federation.\n- Miranda Paige Walls as Mertle Edmonds, Lilo's classmate from their hālau hula who despises and derides her.\n- Kunewa Mook as Moses Puloki, Lilo's hula teacher.\n- Amy Hill as Mrs. Hasagawa, an elderly woman who runs a fruit stand.\n- Susan Hegarty as Rescue Lady, who runs the animal shelter where Lilo adopts Stitch.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nA 1985 concept sketch of Stitch by the character's creator Chris Sanders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 1985, after graduating from California Institute of the Arts, Chris Sanders had created the character of Stitch for an unsuccessful children's book pitch.[8] He said, \"I wanted to do a children's book about this little creature that lived in a forest. It was a bit of a monster with no real explanation as to where it came from.\" But he found it difficult to condense the story and abandoned the project.[9] In 1987, Walt Disney Feature Animation hired him for their newly formed visual development department. His first project was The Rescuers Down Under (1990), but he soon transitioned into storyboarding.[10] After that, Sanders storyboarded sequences for Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994), and was promoted to Head of Story on Mulan (1998).[11]\n\nIn 1997, several executives at Disney Feature Animation were invited to a retreat at Michael Eisner's farm in Vermont to discuss the future animation slate beyond adapting preexisting legends, folklore or classic novels.[12] At the retreat, Thomas Schumacher, then executive vice president of Disney Feature Animation, suggested they produce a film that would be the \"Dumbo for our generation\", compared to the large-budget Disney animated features they had already done.[8] Schumacher approached Sanders about producing the film, telling him: \"Everybody wants this next film to be you.\"[9]\n\nDuring a karaoke dinner at the Walt Disney World Swan Resort, Schumacher asked Sanders, \"Is there anything you would like to develop?\" Sanders remembered the children's book project he had initially developed.[13] At his next meeting, Sanders pitched a remote, non-urban location, with Stitch crash-landing into a forest and interacting entirely with woodland animals, being ostracized by them, and living on his own at a farm in rural Kansas.[14] But Schumacher suggested that Stitch should interact with people instead: \"The animal world is already alien to us. So, if you wanna get the best contrast between this monster and the place where it lives, I would recommend you set it in a human world.\"[13][15][16] Sanders would eventually, albeit inadvertently, revisit his idea of a creature bonding with animals in a forest years later with The Wild Robot (2024).[17]\n\nFor three straight days in his Palm Springs, Florida hotel room, Sanders created a 29-page pitch book drawing conceptual sketches and outlining the film's general story.[13] He initially revised it by adding a boy character.[18] But as the character of Stitch evolved, Sanders decided he needed to be contrasted with a female character: \"I think Stitch represented a male character so the balance would be to put him with a little girl. We wanted someone who was going to be in conflict with Stitch, and we realized a little boy might be a comrade.\"[19] Sanders then glanced at a map of Hawaii on his wall, and recalling he had recently vacationed there, he relocated the story there.[8] Not well versed in Hawaiian culture, Sanders turned to a vacation roadmap and found the names \"Lilo Lane\" and \"Nani\" there.[9] After finishing the booklet, he shipped it to Burbank, and Schumacher approved the pitch with one condition: \"it has to look like you drew it.\"[13]\n\n### Writing\n\n\"Animation has been set so much in ancient, medieval Europe — so many fairy tales find their roots there, that to place it in Hawaii was kind of a big leap. But that choice went to color the entire movie, and rewrite the story for us.\"\n\nDean DeBlois, who had served as \"story co-head\" for Mulan, was brought on to co-write and co-direct Lilo &amp; Stitch after Thomas Schumacher allowed him to leave production on Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001).[20] Meanwhile, Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned as the film's producer. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film's pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.[21]\n\nOriginally, Stitch was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and Jumba was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.[8] Test audience response to early versions of the film led to changing Stitch and Jumba into creation and creator.[8]\n\nWhile the animation team visited Kauaʻi to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ʻohana as it applies to extended families. This concept of ʻohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:\n\nNo matter where we went, our tour guide seemed to know somebody. He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of ʻohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy.\n\nThe island of Kauaʻi had also been featured in such films as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and the Jurassic Park trilogy (1993–2001). Disney's animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film's plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent economic downturn, with the island's serene beauty. The actors voicing the film's young adults, Nani and David, were Tia Carrere, a local of Honolulu, and Jason Scott Lee, who is of Hawaiian descent and grew up in Hawaii. Both Carrere and Lee assisted with rewriting their characters' dialogue in proper colloquial dialect, and with adding Hawaiian slang terms.[22]\n\nOne innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters. At the time, a central relationship between sisters as a major plot element was rare in American animated films.[23]\n\n### Casting\n\nDaveigh Chase earned the role of Lilo in the fall of 1998 against 150 other candidates.[24]\n\nStitch was initially intended to be a non-verbal character, but Sanders said he realized \"he'd have to say a few things, so we made sure that we kept it to a minimum.\" Instead of hiring a professional actor to voice Stitch, DeBlois suggested Sanders take the role. According to Sanders, Stitch's voice was the one he regularly used \"just to bother people at the studio. I'd call people on the phone and do that voice and annoy them.\"[25]\n\nTia Carrere was originally considered for the title character in Mulan (1998), but lost the role to Ming-Na Wen.[26] After learning Disney was doing a Hawaii-set film, Carrere sought a voice role and was hired to voice Nani.[26] She spent two years recording her part in Los Angeles, Paris, and Toronto.[27] Jason Scott Lee was cast as David after Carrere recommended him for the film.[26]\n\nChris Williams, then a storyboard artist, suggested Kevin McDonald for the part of Agent Pleakley. After McDonald read for the part, he was cast.[9] Cobra Bubbles was initially envisioned as more of a nebbish, with Jeff Goldblum in mind for the role. Goldblum declined the role, and Bubbles was reconceived as a more intimidating character. Sanders and DeBlois recalled Ving Rhames's performance in Pulp Fiction (1994) and cast him.[9]\n\nDuring the film's early development, Ricardo Montalbán was cast as one of the villains, with his vocal performance based on the voice he used for Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.[9] However, all the lines he recorded were removed and his character was cut after the meeting that lead to the removal of Stitch's gang from the story. Eventually the villainous role in the film would be Gantu voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson who is best known for playing villain roles in shows and movies. David Ogden Stiers (who had previously done voices for Disney in past films) was chosen to be the voice of Jumba. Australian actress Zoe Caldwell got the role of voicing the Grand Councilwoman, the leader of the United Galactic Federation.[9]\n\n### Design and animation\n\nThe original scene (top) and the one used in the release (bottom); the Boeing 747 and the spaceship are both flying in a sideways position\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a deviation from several decades' worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for Lilo &amp; Stitch, as opposed to the traditional gouache technique.[8] Watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and Dumbo (1941), but the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as gouache. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for Lilo &amp; Stitch to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of Dumbo, requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.[8][21]\n\nThe animation itself was all based on 2D work since the budget was too small for computer-generated imagery.[20] The character designs were based on Sanders's personal drawing style, rather than the traditional Disney in-house style.[8] To assist the animators with adapting Sanders's style, Sue C. Nichols, the film's visual development supervisor, created a manual, Surfing the Sanders Style.[13] Because of the limited budget, details like pockets or designs on clothing were avoided in the animation process, and since they could not afford to do shadows throughout much of the film, many of the scenes took place in shaded areas, saving shadows for more pivotal scenes.[20]\n\nThe film's extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.[28] One altered scene in the film involved Stitch, Nani, Jumba, and Pleakley hijacking a Boeing 747 jet from Lihue Airport that scrapes against buildings through downtown Honolulu. But after the September 11 attacks, with only a few weeks left in production, the climax was completely reworked to have them use Jumba's spacecraft instead. The location was also shifted to have them fly through the mountains of Kauaʻi.[29][30] Regardless, the final design still has engines that resembled the 747's jet engines, according to Sanders.[20]\n\nEven after this adjustment, the team had enough budget for about two additional minutes of animation, which was used to create the epilogue montage of Lilo, Nani, and Stitch becoming a new family.[20][31]\n\n## Release\n\nOn June 16, 2002, Lilo &amp; Stitch premiered at the El Capitan Theatre. Alongside the filmmakers and Disney studio executives, Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley, Wynonna Judd, Phil Collins, Gregory Hines, and Jodie Foster were also in attendance.[32]\n\n### Marketing\n\nWanting Stitch to be a central part of the film's marketing campaign, Sanders pitched a subversive idea: \"what if Stitch invaded other Disney properties?\" Dick Cook, then chairman of Walt Disney Studios, loved the idea and allowed for four parody teaser trailers to be made (nicknamed \"Inter-stitch-als\"), in which Stitch crashes memorable moments of four films from the Disney Renaissance (three of which Sanders had worked on): The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994).[25] Most of the original actors reprised their roles in the trailers, but they were shocked when asked to act negatively toward Stitch.[citation needed] The trailers also include the AC/DC song \"Back in Black.\"\n\nThe marketing campaign also included several tie-in promotions, like Lilo &amp; Stitch toys being offered as part of McDonald's Happy Meals.[33] In the United Kingdom, Lilo &amp; Stitch trailers and television ads featured a cover of Elvis's song \"Suspicious Minds\", performed by Gareth Gates, who became famous on the UK TV program Pop Idol. In the U.S., \"Hound Dog\" was used for both theatrical and television trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family Black Sheep\". As a promotional campaign, comics of Lilo &amp; Stitch ran in Disney Adventures before the film's release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including Stitch's creation and escape. These events were later contradicted by the sequel Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, rendering the comics non-canonical, but the comics are notable for introducing Experiment 625, Reuben, who was a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series.[citation needed] Most of the comic series have been released as a collective volume, Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo &amp; Stitch.\n\n### Home media\n\nLilo &amp; Stitch was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002.[34] During the first day of release, more than 3 million DVD copies were sold, earning $45 million in retail sales.[35][36] This THX-certified DVD release features various bonus features, including a \"Build An Alien Experiment\" game, an audio commentary, music videos, deleted scenes, teaser trailers, and DVD-ROM.[37] In 2003, a 2-disc DVD version was announced to come out along with Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Pocahontas (1995), which were released in 2004 and 2005.\n\nA 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of the film was released in Australia on November 10, 2004 and the UK on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch (2005), but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, called the \"Big Wave Edition\". This DVD edition retained the original supplemental features, along with an audio commentary, a two-hour documentary, more deleted scenes, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, and some games.\n\nOn June 11, 2013, Lilo &amp; Stitch was released on Blu-ray and re-released on DVD alongside Lilo &amp; Stitch 2 in a \"2-Movie Collection\", which included a single Blu-ray with both films but without bonus features, a reprint of disc one of the \"Big Wave Edition\" DVD, and a reprint of the Lilo &amp; Stitch 2 DVD.[38] The \"2-Movie Collection\" has since seen two re-releases; one on January 31, 2017, containing only the Blu-ray and a code to redeem a digital download of the two films,[39] and another on August 9, 2022, which places both films on separate Blu-ray discs that also contain most of their original DVD bonus features, the two DVDs from the first Blu-ray collection, and a digital download code as with the second Blu-ray collection.[40]\n\n#### Altered scene\n\nA scene where Nani chases Lilo was modified for the UK home video release.[41] In the original, Lilo hid in a clothes dryer, which was changed to a commode with a cabinet and pizza box used as a \"door\" to avoid influencing children to hide in dryers.[42] The UK edit was later used for the film's Disney+ release[42] and the 2022 Blu-ray release.[citation needed]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nLilo &amp; Stitch opened in second place earning $35.3 million in its first weekend, ranking narrowly below Tom Cruise's Minority Report.[43] During its second weekend, it fell to third place, behind Minority Report and Mr. Deeds.[44] Despite the opening of Men in Black II the week after, Lilo &amp; Stitch remained in third place.[45]\n\nMeanwhile, Lilo &amp; Stitch continued to draw in families while other major summer blockbusters like Spider-Man and Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones were still in wide release.[46] Additionally, it went on to compete against the Warner Bros. live-action/animated hybrid film, Scooby-Doo, along with Matt Damon's action film, The Bourne Identity.[46] The film earned $145.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million worldwide.[2]\n\nIn the UK, Lilo &amp; Stitch collected $2.4 million during its opening weekend, ranking in first place ahead of Signs and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.[47] The film would be overtaken by Red Dragon in its second weekend.[48]\n\nAt the end of its theatrical run, Lilo &amp; Stitch earned $145.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million worldwide.[2] It became the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2002, behind 20th Century Fox's Ice Age. They were the only two animated films to approach the $100 million mark that year domestically.[49] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.[2]\n\n### Critical reaction\n\nLilo &amp; Stitch received critical acclaim.[50][51] Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.\"[52] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[54]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, writing: \"It's one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years—funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis. It doesn't get sickeningly sweet at the end, it has as much stuff in it for grown-ups as for kids, and it has a bright offbeat look to it.\"[55] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Looser and less obviously formulaic in its fresh approach to our hearts, the brash [film] has an unleashed, subversive sense of humor that's less corporate and more uninhibited than any non-Pixar Disney film has been in time out of mind. With its hand-drawn characters and its use of watercolors for backgrounds (the first time the studio's done that since the 1940s), this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable.\"[56] Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film is \"a bright, engaging bauble with half a dozen Elvis Presley songs for Mom and Dad, and just enough sass. Stitch sticks his tongue into his nose and eats his snot to keep the tweeners giggling ...after a lag in the early sister scenes, Lilo reveals its own very American verve and wit, along with a smart story sense that marks the best animated features, traditional or computerized.\"[57]\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today noted the colors \"are ultra-vibrant and rich, appropriate to the Hawaiian setting. Best of all, the movie has an endearingly cheeky attitude sometimes missing from more earnest Disney tales. Witty, touching and well paced, Lilo &amp; Stitch is ideal family fare, but little more.\"[58] Desson Howe of The Washington Post also praised the film's use of watercolors, writing it is \"appealing. It's easy, rather than flashy, on the eyes. And there's some sort of relief in that, in this world of hyper-powerful computer-generated imagery.\"[59] Owen Gleiberman, reviewing for Entertainment Weekly, argued the \"animation in Lilo &amp; Stitch has an engaging retro-simple vivacity, and it's nice to see a movie for tots make use of Elvis Presley, but the story is witless and oddly defanged. Stitch gets discovered by Lilo, a temperamental Hawaiian girl who's the whiniest of whiny brats. These two become friends in theory only: There's so little connection between them that just about the only thing sustaining the movie is its vague E.T. outline.\"[60]\n\nTodd McCarthy of Variety felt Sanders and DeBlois \"keep things moving briskly while commendably avoiding any special sentimental 'We Are a Village' point-making, despite the obvious opportunity. Character designs are familiar enough, but backgrounds possess an unusual pastel quality that gives the film an inviting atmosphere all its own.\"[61] In contrast, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Gate felt Lilo &amp; Stitch was more appropriate for a television series, writing the directors \"find themselves locked into the structure of a feature film. They're forced to tell the story of Lilo and Stitch's relationship, to give it shape and a sense of arrival. Since this is a kid's movie, the relationship can only head in the direction of schmaltz. So the promising anarchy of the first 10 or 15 minutes is suppressed.\"[62]\n\nPeter M. Nichols states that through the character of Nani and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as The Emperor's New Groove, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and Treasure Planet.[63]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n| Review scores   | Review scores   |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Source          | Rating          |\n| AllMusic        | [64]            |\n\nLilo &amp; Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Disney's 2002 animated feature Lilo &amp; Stitch. It was released by Walt Disney Records on June 11, 2002, on Audio CD and Compact Cassette.\n\nThe soundtrack contains two original songs from the film written by Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu and Alan Silvestri (the film's composer), and performed by Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu and the Kamehameha Schools children's chorus. It also contains five songs by American singer Elvis Presley, and two of his songs re-recorded by contemporary artists. These songs were performed by American singer Wynonna (\"Burning Love\") and Swedish group A-Teens (\"Can't Help Falling in Love\").\n\nOn June 23, 2003, the soundtrack album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 1 million units.[65] On March 17, 2023, the song \"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride\" received Platinum certification from the RIAA for reaching 1 million certified units.[66]\n\n\"Baby You Belong\" by Faith Hill was used as the theme song in the Japanese version. In North America the song was simply an album track with no connotation to the film.[67]\n\n### Track listing\n\n|   No. | Title                            | Performers                                                                      | Length   |\n|-------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride\"   | Alan Silvestri, Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu, The Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus | 3:28     |\n|     2 | \"Stuck on You\"                   | Elvis Presley                                                                   | 2:25     |\n|     3 | \"Burning Love\"                   | Wynonna Judd                                                                    | 3:10     |\n|     4 | \"Suspicious Minds\"               | Elvis Presley                                                                   | 3:23     |\n|     5 | \"Heartbreak Hotel\"               | Elvis Presley                                                                   | 2:13     |\n|     6 | \"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\" | Elvis Presley                                                                   | 2:30     |\n|     7 | \"He Mele No Lilo\"                | Alan Silvestri, Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu, The Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus | 2:28     |\n|     8 | \"Hound Dog\"                      | Elvis Presley                                                                   | 2:27     |\n|     9 | \"Can't Help Falling in Love\"     | A-Teens                                                                         | 3:07     |\n|    10 | \"Stitch to the Rescue (score)\"   | Alan Silvestri                                                                  | 5:57     |\n|    11 | \"You Can Never Belong (score)\"   | Alan Silvestri                                                                  | 3:56     |\n|    12 | \"I'm Lost (score)\"               | Alan Silvestri                                                                  | 4:43     |\n\n### Charts\n\n#### Weekly charts\n\n| Chart (2002)                           |   Peak  position  |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Australian Albums (ARIA)[68]           |                9  |\n| Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)[69]       |               44  |\n| Canadian Albums (Billboard)[70]        |               42  |\n| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[71] |               80  |\n| US Billboard 200[72]                   |               11  |\n| US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard)[73]   |                1  |\n\n#### Year-end charts\n\n| Chart (2002)                         | Position    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|\n| US Billboard 200[74]                 | 151         |\n| US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard)[75] | 10          |\n| Chart (2003)                         | Position    |\n| US Soundtrack Albums (Billboard)[76] | 13          |\n\n### Certifications\n\n#### Lilo &amp; Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n\n| Region                                            | Certification                                     | Certified units/sales                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Australia (ARIA)[77]                              | Gold                                              | 35,000^                                           |\n| United States (RIAA)[65]                          | Platinum                                          | 1,000,000^                                        |\n| ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone. | ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone. | ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone. |\n\n#### \"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride\"\n\n| Region                                                  | Certification                                           | Certified units/sales                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| United States (RIAA)[66]                                | Platinum                                                | 1,000,000‡                                              |\n| ‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. | ‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. | ‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Spin-off media\n\nOn August 26, 2003, Disney released a direct-to-video sequel, Stitch! The Movie, which served as the pilot to a television series titled Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003, and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch's efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba's remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film Leroy &amp; Stitch, which aired on June 23, 2006.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film (set between Lilo &amp; Stitch and Stitch! The Movie), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an original opening, \"Stitch's trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of Lilo &amp; Stitch). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch DVD also contained a short film, The Origin of Stitch, that served as a bridge between Stitch Has a Glitch and Stitch! The Movie.\n\nIn March 2008, Disney announced an anime based on the Lilo &amp; Stitch franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled Stitch!. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in Okinawa Prefecture instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by Madhouse for its first two seasons, and Shin-Ei Animation for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\n\nFrom March 27 to April 6, 2017, an English-language Chinese animated television series based on the franchise titled Stitch &amp; Ai aired in China with a Mandarin Chinese dub. It was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media. Like with the Stitch! anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the Huangshan mountains. Unlike Stitch!, however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series) and then dubbed into Mandarin Chinese; the original English production aired in Southeast Asia during February 2018.\n\n### Live-action adaptation\n\nIn October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Walt Disney Pictures was developing a live-action remake of Lilo &amp; Stitch to be produced by Aladdin producers Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich and written by Mike Van Waes.[78] In November 2020, it was reported that Jon M. Chu entered talks to direct the film and that it was unclear if the film would be released in theaters or on Disney+. In July 2022, Dean Fleischer Camp replaced Chu as the film's director.[79] In February 2023, Zach Galifianakis joined the film.[80][81] On March 31, 2023, it was announced that Maia Kealoha was cast as Lilo.[82] Further cast members were announced that April, including Sydney Agudong as Nani,[4] Courtney B. Vance as Bubbles,[83] and Billy Magnussen in an undisclosed role.[84] Kahiau Machado was originally cast as David, but was later replaced by Kaipo Dudoit.[85] On April 21, 2023, Galifianakis was confirmed to play Jumba, and Magnussen was confirmed to play Pleakley, while Chris Sanders entered in final negotiations to return as the voice of Stitch.[86] Tia Carrere, the original voice actress of Nani, was announced to play Mrs. Kekoa, while Amy Hill, who voiced Mrs. Hasagawa in the original, will portray a new character named Tūtū.[87]\n\nIn August 2024, the film was shifted to a summer 2025 theatrical release.[88] Two months later, the film was given a release date of May 23, 2025 in the United States.[89]\n\n### Video games\n\nThere were three official games released in 2002 to coincide with the film: Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch: Trouble in Paradise for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch for Game Boy Advance, and Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626 for PlayStation 2. Stitch is also a summonable character in Kingdom Hearts II and III, and appears along with his homeworld in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PlayStation Portable. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the Nintendo 3DS game Disney Magical World and its sequel. Stitch is also a playable character in the Disney Infinity series in the second game, Disney Infinity 2.0, and the series' third and final game, Disney Infinity 3.0. He was also a meet and greet character in Kinect: Disneyland Adventures. Some characters of the film are playable characters in the game Disney Magic Kingdoms. Stitch also appears as a playable character in the mobile game Disney Mirrorverse, and as an unlockable villager Disney Dreamlight Valley. Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Gantu, and (from Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series) Angel are playable racers in Disney Speedstorm, which also features a track environment based on the film's depiction of Kauaʻi.\n\n## See also\n\n- Disney portal\n- Film portal\n- Animation portal\n- Cartoon portal\n- Comedy portal\n- United States portal\n\n- List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Credited as \"Based on an idea by\"\n- ^ a b Chris Sanders was credited as \"Christopher Michael Sanders\" (his full name) for his voice role as Stitch.\n- ^ Distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution through the Walt Disney Pictures banner.\n- ^ The first being Mulan (1998) and the third being Brother Bear (2003).\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Lilo &amp;amp; Stitch (2002)\".

He began his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, starting at Troma Entertainment with Tromeo and Juliet (1996). He then began working as a director, starting with the horror-comedy film Slither (2006), and moving to the superhero genre with Super (2010), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), The Suicide Squad (2021), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).\n\nIn 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery hired Gunn and Peter Safran to become co-chairmen and co-CEOs of DC Studios.[1] Under DC Studios, Gunn will co-produce and executive produce every film and television series under the upcoming DC Universe (DCU) media franchise alongside Safran, which will act as a soft-reboot of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). In the DCU, he is the creator of the series Creature Commandos (2024) and the writer-director of the upcoming film Superman (2025).\n\nHe also wrote and directed the web series James Gunn's PG Porn (2008–2009), the HBO Max original series Peacemaker (2022–present) and the Disney+ original special The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022). Other work for which he is known include writing for the 2004 remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978), writing the live-action adaptation of Scooby Doo (2002), and its sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004),  writing and producing the horror-action film The Belko Experiment (2016), producing the superhero-horror film Brightburn (2019), and contributing to comedy-anthology film Movie 43 (2013) (directing the segment \"Beezel\") and the 2012 hack-and-slash video game Lollipop Chainsaw.\n\n## Early life\n\nJames Francis Gunn Jr.[2] was born on August 5, 1966[3][n 1] in St. Louis, Missouri,[4] to parents James F. Gunn, an attorney, and Leota \"Lee\" (Hynek).[8][9][10] He was raised Catholic[11] in the St. Louis suburb of Manchester, Missouri.[12][13] He has five siblings — actor Sean, actor and political writer Matt, screenwriter Brian, Patrick, and Beth.[14][15][16] Gunn is of Irish descent[17] his father coming from an Irish immigrant family.[18] Gunn has stated that his family's surname was originally the Irish name MacGilgunn and that it means \"sons to the servants of the god of the dead\"; it actually means \"son of the brown youth.\"[19][20][21][22]\n\nGrowing up, Gunn was influenced by low-budget films such as Night of the Living Dead and Friday the 13th. He read magazines like Fangoria and attended genre movie screenings, including the original Dawn of the Dead at the Tivoli Theatre in St. Louis. At the age of 12, he began making 8 mm zombie films with his brothers in the woods near their home.[23]\n\nGunn and his brothers all attended the Jesuit St. Louis University High School, where he graduated in 1984.[7][8] He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Louis University.[24] While at Saint Louis University, Gunn created political cartoons for the school's student weekly, The University News.[25] Gunn said that, at an unspecified time in his college education, \"I went to two years undergraduate film school at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. But I was pretty screwed up at the time, and had to leave. Years later I went to graduate school at the Columbia University School of Fine Arts but I studied prose writing, not film writing.\"[26] He earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 1995.[27]\n\n## Career\n\n### Music\n\nWhile living in St. Louis, Gunn founded a band, The Icons, in 1989, serving as lead vocalist. The group released the album Mom, We Like It Here on Earth in 1994, and its songs \"Sunday\" and \"Walking Naked\" were featured in the film Tromeo and Juliet. The Icons disbanded in the mid-1990s.[28] Gunn has continued to work in music, composing songs for Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, and Movie 43.\n\n### Film and television\n\nGunn in 2013\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGunn began his career in filmmaking with Troma Entertainment in 1996, for which he co-wrote the independent film Tromeo and Juliet. Working alongside his mentor Lloyd Kaufman, the co-founder of Troma, Gunn learned how to write screenplays, produce films, scout locations, direct actors, distribute films, and create his own poster art.[23] After contributing to several other Troma films, Gunn in 2000 wrote, produced and performed in the superhero comedy The Specials, directed by Craig Mazin and featuring Rob Lowe, Thomas Haden Church, Paget Brewster, Judy Greer and Jamie Kennedy.\n\nGunn's first major Hollywood screenplay was Scooby-Doo in 2002. In 2004, he wrote the screenplays for the remake of Dawn of the Dead and the sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. With these films, Gunn became the first screenwriter to have two films top the box office in consecutive weeks.[29] That same year, he executive produced and starred in the mockumentary LolliLove, directed by and starring his then-wife Jenna Fischer. His film directorial debut was the 2006 horror-comedy Slither, which was included on Rotten Tomatoes' list of the 50 Best Ever Reviewed Horror Movies.[30]\n\nGunn's next projects included the comedy short film \"Humanzee!\" which was originally intended exclusively for the Xbox Live's Horror Meets Comedy series of short comedy films by horror directors, it was replaced with \"Sparky and Mikaela\" which debuted on Xbox Live on December 31, 2008. In an April 2009 interview on The Jace Hall Show, Gunn described \"Sparky and Mikaela\" as being \"about a human [and] racoon crime fighting team and they fight crime in both the forest world, among the furry animals, and in the human world\".[31] Gunn also has a short-form web series for Spike.com titled James Gunn's PG Porn.\n\nIn 2008, Gunn was a judge on the VH1 reality television show Scream Queens, where 10 unknown actresses compete for a role in the film Saw VI.[32]\n\nIn 2009, Gunn announced he was going to write and direct Pets, a comedy about a man who is abducted by aliens who want to turn him into a household pet, with Ben Stiller, Stuart Cornfeld and Jeremy Kramer producing.[33] However, by March 2009, Gunn announced, \"Pets unfortunately, is done. I'm gone. I left the project for various reasons. I hope it sees the light of day somehow, but it won't be with me attached as director.\"[34]\n\nIn 2010, Gunn released Super, a dark comedy and superhero satire starring Rainn Wilson and Elliot Page. He also directed a segment of the 2013 comedy anthology film Movie 43 (2013); the segment starred Elizabeth Banks and Josh Duhamel. The film was critically panned.\n\nGunn in 2014\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGunn co-wrote and directed the Marvel Studios adaptation of Guardians of the Galaxy, which was released on August 1, 2014.[35] His brother, Sean, has a role in the film. Gunn has appeared as an actor, mostly in smaller roles or uncredited appearances in his own projects. After Dan Gilroy and Jack Black separately lamented the proliferation of superhero films,[36] Gunn responded in a Facebook post, saying in part:\n\nPopular fare in any medium has always been snubbed by the self-appointed elite. ... What bothers me slightly is that many people assume because you make big films that you put less love, care, and thought into them than people do who make independent films or who make what are considered more serious Hollywood films. ... If you think people who make superhero movies are dumb, come out and say we're dumb. But if you, as an independent filmmaker or a 'serious' filmmaker, think you put more love into your characters than the Russo Brothers do Captain America, or Joss Whedon does the Hulk, or I do a talking raccoon, you are simply mistaken.[37]\n\nGunn wrote and produced the horror film The Belko Experiment, which was released in 2017.[38] In 2016, he directed three Stan Lee cameo scenes in one day, for the film Doctor Strange and two unrevealed projects.[39][40][41]\n\nGunn wrote and directed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[42][43][44] Gunn was slated to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in July 2018, but before the project started, Disney severed ties with Gunn as the director amid controversy over off-color jokes he had tweeted.[45] Gunn was rehired in March 2019 after a mass public appeal, many saying he was the reason of the previous movies' successes.[46]\n\nIn October 2018, Gunn was hired to write a completely new script for the DC Extended Universe film The Suicide Squad, with the intention of also serving as director, after its original director Gavin O'Connor left due to scheduling issues.[47][48] In January 2019, he was officially confirmed to direct The Suicide Squad.[49] He also wrote, directed, and produced the spin-off television series for the film centered on the character Peacemaker played by John Cena for Max.[50] Gunn also co-wrote and co-produced a live-action/animated film titled Coyote vs. Acme, based on the Looney Tunes character Wile E. Coyote, for Warner Bros. Pictures Animation.[51]\n\n### Other media\n\nGunn wrote a novel in 2000, The Toy Collector, a story of a hospital orderly who steals drugs from the hospital which he sells to help keep his toy collection habit alive. In 1998, he and Troma's President Lloyd Kaufman co-wrote All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from The Toxic Avenger, about his experiences with Kaufman while working at Troma.\n\nHe wrote the story for Grasshopper Manufacture's video game Lollipop Chainsaw, working with game designer Suda 51.[52]\n\n### Firing from Disney and reinstatement\n\nGunn at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2018, in reaction to Gunn's public criticisms of President Donald Trump, commentator Mike Cernovich drew attention to controversial jokes that Gunn posted on social media between 2008 and 2012 involving pedophilia and the Holocaust.[53][54] Amid criticism of the tweets, Disney severed ties with Gunn as the director of the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 film at the time;[55] Gunn responded: \"I have regretted [those jokes] for many years since. [...] Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then. All I can do now [is offer] my sincere and heartfelt regret [...] To everyone inside my industry and beyond, I again offer my deepest apologies.\"[55][56]\n\nWalt Disney Studios's decision received criticism from many entertainers and journalists, including actors Dave Bautista, Selma Blair, Patton Oswalt, David Dastmalchian, Michael Ian Black, Mikaela Hoover, Mike Colter, Alex Winter, David Hasselhoff, directors Joe Carnahan and Fede Álvarez, comics artist Jim Starlin, musician Rhett Miller, comedian Jim Jefferies, Rick and Morty creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, journalist David A. French and Troma Entertainment founder and president Lloyd Kaufman.[a] Bobcat Goldthwait, who worked as a voice actor on the 1997 Disney film Hercules, responded to the incident by asking Disney to remove his voice from an upcoming park attraction based on the film.[66]\n\nA number of media outlets criticized Disney's decision, including Collider, Cartoon Brew, The Daily Dot, The Independent, National Review, MovieWeb, and Vulture.[67][58][68][69][70][71][72] An online petition urging Disney to re-hire Gunn received over 400,000 signatures.[57][73][74][75] On July 30, 2018, Guardians of the Galaxy cast members Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff and Michael Rooker released a joint statement through social media expressing their support for Gunn.[76]\n\nBecause of the situation, Sony Pictures decided to not promote the horror film Brightburn, which Gunn produced, at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con.[77] However, when the first trailer for the film was released on December 8, 2018, Gunn's name was prominently featured. The film opened in May 2019.[78]\n\nIn March 2019, Gunn was reinstated by Disney as director of the film after meeting with Alan Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Gunn started production on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in October 2021, after The Suicide Squad had been completed.[46]\n\n### DC Studios\n\nGunn and frequent producing partner Peter Safran had advised David Zaslav, the CEO of the newly created Warner Bros. Discovery, during his search for a new head of DC Films. The duo impressed Zaslav who decided to appoint them as the co-chairpersons and CEOs of DC Films, rebranded as \"DC Studios\", with control over films, animation and television projects based on characters from DC Comics. Gunn oversees the creative aspects and will be exclusive to Warner Bros. Discovery during his tenure, except for his prior commitments to Disney. The two assumed their positions on November 1, 2022.[79][80][81][82]\n\nIn December 2022, Gunn announced that he was writing a film about a young Superman during his early years in Metropolis,[83] later revealed to be titled Superman and scheduled for release in July 2025; in March 2023 it was confirmed Gunn would also direct the project.[84] In January 2023, Gunn and Safran revealed their plans for future DCU films, with the first chapter being titled \"Gods and Monsters\". Gunn also wrote a seven-episode animated series titled Creature Commandos, based on the comic book team of the same name,[85] and also worked on the HBO Max series Waller, a spin-off of Peacemaker focusing on the character of Amanda Waller, with Christal Henry writing and Viola Davis reprising her role from previous DCEU projects.[86][87] Gunn is also involved in multiple other DC projects, including producing Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow due for release in 2026.[88][89]\n\n## Personal life\n\nGunn married actress Jenna Fischer on October 7, 2000.[8] After seven years of marriage, Gunn and Fischer announced their separation in a joint statement on September 5, 2007,[90] divorcing in 2008.[91] The two remained friends. In 2010, Fischer persuaded Gunn to cast Rainn Wilson, her co-star on The Office, in Gunn's film Super.[23]\n\nGunn has been in a relationship with actress Jennifer Holland since 2015.[92] In February 2022, Holland and Gunn became engaged,[93] and were married at the end of September 2022.[94]\n\nHe has a dog named Ozu, adopted from a shelter in 2022. Gunn has regularly shared photos of the dog and promoted #AdoptDontShop.[95] For that reason as well as his CGI work on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, PETA declared Gunn to be their 2023 Person of the Year.[96]\n\nGunn was raised in a Catholic family and has mentioned how prayer continues to play an important role in his life,[97] but has also said that he is, \"in some ways, anti-religion\".[98]\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n|   Year  | Title                            | Director    | Writer    | Producer    | Notes                                                              |\n|---------|----------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   1996  | Tromeo and Juliet                | Associate   | Yes       | No          | Co-written with Lloyd Kaufman Executive in charge of production    |\n|   2000  | The Specials                     | No          | Yes       | Associate   |                                                                    |\n|   2002  | Scooby-Doo                       | No          | Yes       | No          | Story co-written with Craig Titley                                 |\n|   2004  | Dawn of the Dead                 | No          | Yes       | No          |                                                                    |\n|   2004  | Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed | No          | Yes       | Co-producer |                                                                    |\n|   2006  | Slither                          | Yes         | Yes       | No          | Feature film directorial debut                                     |\n|   2010  | Super                            | Yes         | Yes       | No          |                                                                    |\n|   2014  | Guardians of the Galaxy          | Yes         | Yes       | No          | Co-written with Nicole Perlman;

It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Set in 1985, it follows Marty McFly (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend Emmett \"Doc\" Brown (Lloyd), where he inadvertently prevents his future parents from falling in love – threatening his own existence – and is forced to reconcile them and somehow get back to the future.\n\nGale and Zemeckis conceived the idea for Back to the Future in 1980. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, but the project was rejected more than forty times by various studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. A development deal was secured with Universal Pictures following Zemeckis's success directing Romancing the Stone (1984). Fox was the first choice to portray Marty but was unavailable; Eric Stoltz was cast instead. Shortly after principal photography began in November 1984, Zemeckis determined Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox, including re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4 million to the budget. Back to the Future was filmed in and around California and on sets at Universal Studios, and concluded the following April.\n\nAfter highly successful test screenings, the release date was brought forward to July 3, 1985, giving the film more time in theaters during the busiest period of the theatrical year. The change resulted in a rushed post-production schedule and some incomplete special effects. Back to the Future was a critical and commercial success, earning $381.1 million to become the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. Critics praised the story, humor, and the cast, particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an Academy Award, three Saturn Awards, and a Hugo Award. Its theme song, \"The Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis and the News, was also a success.\n\nBack to the Future has since grown in esteem and is now considered by critics and audiences to be one of the greatest science fiction films and among the best films ever made. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. The film was followed by two sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990). Spurred by the film's dedicated fan following and effect on popular culture, Universal Studios launched a multimedia franchise, which now includes video games, theme park rides, an animated television series, and a stage musical. Its enduring popularity has prompted numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. After Marty's band fails a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions.\n\nThat night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, in the Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955 (the day he first conceived his time travel invention), the terrorists arrive unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches 88 miles per hour (142 kilometers per hour).\n\nArriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium, so he cannot return to 1985. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father and discovers Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine changing clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future, but Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the 1.21 gigawatts of power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town's courthouse. As Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he carries with him, Doc realizes Marty's actions are altering the future and jeopardizing his existence; Lorraine was supposed to tend to George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine's infatuation with Marty deepens.\n\nLorraine asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate advances on her, allowing George to intervene and rescue her, but the plan goes awry when Biff's gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band's car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, so Marty takes his place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty hurries to the courthouse to meet Doc.\n\nDoc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and rips it, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty recalibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he had left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he had pieced Marty's note back together and wore a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to discover his father is now a confident and successful science fiction author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates.[a]\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin 1985 (left) and  in 2010\n\n- Michael J.

He did not think so, but realized he could test his theory if he could travel back to a time when he and his parents were a similar age.[12] He shared the idea with Zemeckis, who recalled his mother's childhood stories were often contradictory.[11]\n\nGale and Zemeckis began a draft in late 1980. They sketched and acted out each scene to help develop the dialogue and actions.[12] They believed many time-travel films focused on the past being immutable and wanted to show the past being altered and the effect those changes would have on the future.[11] In the draft, video pirate Professor Brown builds a time machine that sends his young friend Marty back to the 1950s where he interrupts his parents' first meeting.[13] In September 1980, Gale and Zemeckis pitched their idea to Columbia Pictures president Frank Price, who had liked Used Cars and was keen to work with the pair. Gale recalled having to rein in Zemeckis's enthusiastic pitch before Price had time to change his mind.[10] Gale and Zemeckis completed the first draft for Price on February 21, 1981, but Price believed it needed significant refinement.[13]\n\nSome early concepts were abandoned. Originally, Marty's actions in 1955 had a more significant impact on the future, making 1985 more futuristic and advanced, but every person who read the script took issue with the idea.[9][14] Marty's father also became a boxer, a result of his knockout punch on Biff.[14] The time machine was a stationary object moved around on the back of a truck.[7][14][15] Inspired by the documentary The Atomic Cafe, the drained time machine was written to be powered by Marty driving it into a nuclear explosion, combined with an additional ingredient: Coca-Cola.[b] Gale and Zemeckis took inspiration from tales of legendary scientists, opting to make the time machine's creator an individual instead of a faceless corporation or government.[9] The pair wanted the inciting time-travel incident to be an accident so that it would not appear that the hero was seeking personal gain.[14]\n\nGale and Zemeckis drew humor from the cultural contrasts between 1955 and 1985, such as Marty entering a 1955 soda shop in 1985 clothing; the  shop owner asks Marty if he is a sailor because his down vest resembles a life preserver. They also identified conveniences of 1985 that Marty had taken for granted, but would be denied in 1955. Gale and Zemeckis struggled with the writing, as they were in their 30s and did not particularly identify with either era.[12] They were inspired by the All-American aesthetic of films by Frank Capra featuring white picket fences and exaggerated characters similar to Biff,[18] The Twilight Zone, science fiction films, and books by Robert Silverberg and Robert Heinlein.[19] The romantic relationship between 1955 Lorraine and her future son was one of the more difficult writing challenges.[20] Gale and Zemeckis attempted to take the concept as far as possible to keep the audience on edge. They believed it had to be Lorraine who stopped the relationship; she remarks that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother. Gale jokingly said no one asked how she could make that comparison, but that audiences would accept it because they did not want the relationship to happen.[10] The second draft was completed by April 7, 1981.[13]\n\n### Development\n\nSteven Spielberg in 1993. He mentored Zemeckis and lent his experience and Hollywood studio clout to support the production of Back to the Future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrice opted not to green-light the second draft; although he liked it, he did not believe it would appeal to anyone else.[21] The most successful comedies at the time, such as Animal House (1978), Porky's (1981), and Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), featured sexual and bawdy elements; Back to the Future was considered too tame in comparison.[22][10] The project went into turnaround (a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea).[10][23] The script was rejected some forty times, sometimes multiple times by the same studios.[9] Reasons given included the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth[23] and the failures of other time travel films, such as The Final Countdown (1980) and Time Bandits (1981).[10][24] Walt Disney Productions turned it down because they considered Marty's fighting off his future mother's advances too risqué for their brand.[22] The only supporter of the project was Spielberg, but with their previous collaborations considered relative failures, Gale and Zemeckis feared another misstep would suggest they could get work only through being friends with Spielberg.[9][22]\n\nZemeckis accepted the next project offered to him, Romancing the Stone (1984).[11][22][25] Against expectations, the film was a significant success and gave Zemeckis enough credibility to return to Back to the Future.[c] Zemeckis held a grudge against the studios that had rejected the project and turned to Spielberg, who had set up his own production company, Amblin Entertainment, at Universal Studios, where Price now worked.[18][27] Spielberg disliked Price because he had rejected E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and demanded his involvement in Back to the Future be minimal. Sidney Sheinberg installed himself as chief executive to oversee the studio's investment in the project.[28] Amblin executives Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joined Spielberg as the film's executive producers.[10][29]\n\nHowever, rights to Back to the Future remained with Columbia Pictures. Price's successor at Columbia Pictures, Guy McElwaine, was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film Double Indemnity (1944) called Big Trouble (1986). Its similarities to Double Indemnity meant the studio would violate Universal Pictures' copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price; in exchange, Price obtained the rights to Back to the Future.[30]\n\nSheinberg suggested modifications to the film, including changing the title to Space Man from Pluto, believing Back to the Future would not resonate with audiences.[19][31] Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg's suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo reading: \"Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.\" Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit his memo was to be taken seriously.[18][31] Sheinberg later claimed the story was \"bullshit\".[32] Sheinberg also wanted to change the name of Marty's mother from Meg to Lorraine (a tribute to his wife Lorraine Gary), and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it more accessible.[19][33] The third draft was completed by July 1984.[33] The lengthy development allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script's jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980.[12] The joke about former actor Ronald Reagan becoming President of the United States remained following his re-election in 1984.[12]\n\n### Casting\n\nEric Stoltz (pictured in 2009) was cast as Marty McFly and spent several weeks filming Back to the Future before the role was re-cast.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael J. Fox was the first choice to portray Marty McFly. Gale and Zemeckis believed his acting timing in the NBC sitcom Family Ties (1982–1989) as the sophisticated Alex P. Keaton could be translated to Marty's clumsiness.[11][34] Spielberg asked the show's producer Gary David Goldberg to have Fox read the script. Concerned Fox's absence would damage Family Ties' success, especially with fellow star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, Goldberg did not give Fox the script.[35] Other young stars were considered, including: John Cusack, C. Thomas Howell, Johnny Depp, Ralph Macchio, Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, Ben Stiller, Peter DeLuise, Billy Zane, George Newbern, Robert Downey Jr., Christopher Collet, Matthew Modine, and Corey Hart (who declined to audition).[d] Howell was the frontrunner,[37] but Sheinberg preferred Eric Stoltz, who had impressed with his portrayal of Rocky Dennis in an early screening of the drama film Mask (1985).[40][38] With the filming date approaching, Zemeckis opted for Stoltz.[40] Sheinberg promised that if Stoltz did not work out, they could reshoot the film.[10] The character's name was derived from Used Cars production assistant Marty Casella. Zemeckis suggested McFly because it sounded \"All-American\".[9]\n\nAmong others, Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, Dudley Moore, Ron Silver, Robin Williams, John Cleese, Mandy Patinkin, Gene Hackman, James Woods, and Mark Mothersbaugh were considered for the role of Doc Brown.[e] Producer Neil Canton suggested Lithgow, having worked with him and Christopher Lloyd on Buckaroo Banzai (1984). Lithgow was unavailable, and the role was offered to Lloyd. He was reluctant to join the production until a friend encouraged him to take the part.[43] Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski inspired Lloyd's wild, white hair.[44] Lloyd affected a hunched posture to lower his 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 meters) height closer to the 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall Fox.[38]\n\nThe filmmakers became aware of Lea Thompson while researching Stoltz in the comedy-drama The Wild Life (1984).[45] Crispin Glover used many of his own mannerisms in portraying George McFly. Gale described his performance as \"nuts\", and Zemeckis was reportedly unhappy with Glover's performance choices, instructing him to be more restrained as the older George.[14][46] Glover lost his voice during filming and later dubbed in some lines.[7] Deluise, Zane, Tim Robbins, and J. J. Cohen were considered to play Biff Tannen.[7][47][48] Cohen was not considered intimidating enough against Stoltz, and the role went to Thomas F. Wilson, his first feature starring role.[49][50] Zane and Cohen were cast as Biff's minions Match and Skinhead instead.[47][51] Tannen's name was taken from Universal Studios executive Ned Tanen, who had been unpleasant with Gale and Zemeckis.[7]\n\nMelora Hardin was cast as Jennifer Parker on a two-film contract. After Stoltz's replacement, the crew were polled about Hardin being taller than Fox; the female crew overwhelmingly voted Marty should not be shorter than his girlfriend.[38][52][53] Hardin was replaced by Claudia Wells, who had previously declined the role because of her commitment to the short-lived television series Off the Rack (1984).[38][52][54] Actresses Kyra Sedgwick and Jill Schoelen were also considered; Schoelen was told she looked too \"exotic\" and not sufficiently All-American.[55][56] Doc Brown's pet, a dog named Einstein, was originally scripted as a chimpanzee named Shemp. Sheinberg insisted films featuring chimps never did well.[7][24] James Tolkan was the first choice for Principal Strickland after Zemeckis saw him in the crime drama Prince of the City (1981).[57] Singer and soundtrack contributor Huey Lewis cameos as a Battle of the Bands judge. Lewis agreed to appear as long as he was uncredited and could wear a disguise.[6] Gale cameos as the hand in the radiation suit tapping the DeLorean time display.[58]\n\n### Filming with Stoltz\n\nA house in Arleta, Los Angeles, served as the McFlys' home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 26, 1984, on a 14-week schedule set to conclude on February 28, 1985, with an estimated $14 million budget.[59][60] Filming took place mainly at the Universal Studios lot and on location in California.[14] Dean Cundey served as the cinematographer; he and Zemeckis had collaborated on Romancing the Stone.[14] Editor Arthur Schmidt was hired after Zemeckis saw his work on Firstborn (1984); Schmidt recommended hiring Harry Keramidas as co-editor.[61] Frank Marshall also served as a second unit director.[62]\n\nOwing to the tight schedule, editing occurred concurrently with filming.[63] On December 30, 1984, Zemeckis reviewed the existing scenes with Schmidt and Keramidas.[64] Zemeckis was reluctant to review the footage because he would be self-critical,[65] but he believed Stoltz's acting was not working and had already listed several scenes he wanted to reshoot.[9][14][65] Zemeckis called in Gale and the producers to show them the footage; they agreed Stoltz was not right for the part.[9] Stoltz was performing the role with an intense and serious tone, not the \"screwball\" energy they desired.[34][49] Gale characterized Stoltz as a good actor in the wrong role.[66]\n\nStoltz utilized method acting and stayed in character as Marty when not filming, refusing to answer to his own name. This resulted in feuding with some of the cast and crew, including Wilson. Stoltz put his full strength into pushing Wilson rather than imitating doing so, despite Wilson's protests.[49] Spielberg said Zemeckis needed a replacement in place before firing Stoltz, or he risked the production being canceled.[67] Zemeckis and the producers asked Sheinberg for permission to do whatever was necessary to accommodate Fox's participation;[49] Spielberg made another call to Goldberg. On January 3, 1985, Goldberg told Fox about withholding the Back to the Future script from him, and the filmmakers wanted to know if he was interested. Baxter had returned to the show, and they could be more flexible with Fox as long as Family Ties took priority. Fox agreed to join without reading the script.[68] The transition could not take place immediately and filming continued with Stoltz in the lead role, unaware he was to be replaced.[49]\n\nOn January 10, 1985, Zemeckis informed Stoltz that he was being fired.[10][49][69] Zemeckis described it as \"the hardest meeting I've ever had in my life and it was all my fault. I broke [Stoltz's] heart.\"[10] Stoltz was reported to have told his makeup artist he was not a comedian and did not understand why he was cast.[70] The producers informed the principal cast and the rest of the crew much of the film would be re-shot.[49][71] Cundey said most of the crew saw Stoltz's removal as \"good news\".[14] Crew members later said there were obvious signs Stoltz would be replaced; the set designers were told to not change the 1955 set, and a scene involving a discussion between Marty and Doc was filmed showing only Doc.[49] Stoltz had shot numerous key scenes including Marty traveling to 1955 in the DeLorean, its breaking down as he prepares to return to 1985, and his final scene was Marty's return to 1985.[46][49] Filming fell behind schedule, with 34 days of filming lost and an additional cost of $3.5–$4.0 million, including Stoltz receiving his salary in full.[10][66][72] Universal Pictures' marketing team was tasked with mitigating the negative publicity from a project replacing its main star.[73]\n\n### Filming with Fox\n\nThe Hill Valley town square and clock tower were a set built on the Universal Studios' backlot.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFox's first day on set was January 15, 1985.[74] He filmed Family Ties during the day before traveling to the Back to the Future filming location. Often, he would not return home until early the following morning, and on weekends, the schedule was pushed back further as Family Ties was filmed in front of a live audience.[10][14][34] The teamster drivers entrusted with dropping off Fox at home often had to carry the actor to bed.[10] This continued until April, when Family Ties finished filming.[75] Gale said Fox's youth meant he could cope with less sleep than usual;[14] Fox described it as exhausting, but worth the effort.[34] Further into the filming schedule, Fox was energetic during his scenes but struggled to stay awake off set. He ad-libbed some lines when he forgot the intended dialogue,[14][76] and recalled looking for a camcorder on the Family Ties set, before realizing it was a prop on Back to the Future.[76] He also had to learn to mimic playing the guitar and choreographed skateboarding routines taught by Per Welinder and Bob Schmelzer.[77]\n\nTo compensate for his conflicting schedules and reduce production costs, some scenes involving Marty were shot without Fox, who filmed his part separately.[11][14] Re-shooting scenes allowed the filmmakers to identify problems and implement new ideas. To avoid building an additional classroom set, the opening pan across the array of clocks in Doc Brown's laboratory replaced an opening scene where Marty sets off a fire alarm to get out of detention.[17][78] The height differences between Stoltz and Fox necessitated other changes, such as a scene of Fox teaching George how to punch because Fox could not reach the necessary prop.[79] According to Gale, once Fox replaced Stoltz, the atmosphere on set improved.[10] Thompson anecdotally said while Stoltz ate lunch alone in his trailer, Fox ate lunch with the cast and crew.[80]\n\nThe production used many locations in and around Los Angeles. The clock tower is a structure on the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City, California.[81][82] When filmed from below, Lloyd was positioned on a recreation of the clock tower, but when filmed from above, Lloyd stood atop the tower itself.[83] Production designer Lawrence G. Paull insisted on using the Universal backlot sets because of the difficulties and costs involved in making an on-location area look 1955-appropriate.[84] Whittier High School in the city of Whittier is the Hill Valley high school. Marty's home and the surrounding Lyon estates are in Arleta, Los Angeles. Several of the residential locations were filmed in Pasadena: Lorraine's and George's 1955 homes, and Doc Brown's 1955 home. (Its exterior is the Gamble House; interiors were shot at the historic Blacker House.)[82] Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry, California serves as the Twin Pines mall, which later becomes the Lone Pine mall after Marty knocks over one of the trees at Twin Pines ranch in 1955, which was filmed at the Walt Disney Studios-owned Golden Oak Ranch in Newhall, Santa Clarita, California.[49][82] Other locations include the basement of the Hollywood United Methodist Church where the school dance was filmed, and Griffith Park, where Marty begins his drive to the courthouse to return to 1985, passing by a lamp post outside the Greek Theatre.[82]\n\nFilming concluded after 107 days on April 26, 1985. The final day of filming included pick-up shots of Marty and Einstein the dog in the DeLorean.[75]\n\n### Post-production\n\nA rough cut of the film was test screened for audiences at Century 22 theater in San Jose, California, only three weeks after filming concluded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nArthur F. Repola served as the post-production supervisor, but he became responsible for many aspects outside his role, including budgets, storyboarding, and general problem-solving. Those roles belonged to Kennedy and Marshall, but both were occupied on other films.[85] Schmidt found editing the film difficult because he had to imagine where the special effects would later be added; there was no time or budget to re-edit afterward.[86]\n\nA rough version of the movie was cut together for a test screening at the Century 22 theater in San Jose, California, in mid-May 1985, just three weeks after filming concluded. The audience was seemingly uninterested at the exposition-heavy opening but became engaged after the DeLorean appeared.[87] At a test screening in Long Beach, California, 94% of the audience responded they would recommend the film; 99% rated it very good or excellent.[22] Gale said there was some concern when Doc's dog Einstein was sent through time, as the audience believed he had been killed.[14] But Gale said when they came to the cafe scene where Marty sees his father, the auidence \"got it\". The film was re-cut and screened again at the Alfred Hitchcock theater at Universal Studios for executives, including Sheinberg.[88] He was so impressed he moved the scheduled release date forward to July 3, 1985, to give it more time in theaters during the peak summer season.[66] The new date reduced the post-production schedule to just nine weeks for special effects and editing.[14][66] Zemeckis spent much of June rushing to finish the film.[22]\n\nDeleted scenes include: Doc looking at an issue of Playboy, remarking the future looks better; a scene of 1985 George being coerced into buying a large amount of peanut brittle from a young girl;[9][89] a scene of young George trapped in a phone booth by the man who interrupts his dance with Lorraine;[90] and the scene of Marty pretending to be \"Darth Vader\", which was shortened.[89] Zemeckis considered cutting the \"Johnny B. Goode\" performance because it did not advance the story, but test audiences reacted well to it.[91] There is a dispute if a shot of Stoltz's hand is in the finished film in the scene where Marty punches Biff. Gale noted it is impossible to tell without checking the original film negative, which would risk damaging it.[51][92] The final 116‑minute cut was completed on June 23, 1985.[93][94] Universal Studios took out a full-page advertisement in Variety magazine, thanking the post-production crew for completing their work on time.[93] The final budget was $19 million.[95][96]\n\n### Music\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlan Silvestri wanted to create a \"heroic\" theme that could be recognizable from only a few notes.\n\nAlan Silvestri composed the score for Back to the Future; he had worked with Zemeckis on Romancing the Stone. The only direction Zemeckis gave him was \"it's got to be big\". Silvestri used an orchestral score to create a sound that contrasted with the small-town setting and the significant time-changing events occurring within it. He wanted a heroic theme that would be instantly recognizable.[10]\n\nHuey Lewis was approached to write a theme song for the film; he was coming off the success of his recent album Sports. He met with Gale, Spielberg, and Zemeckis, who intended that Huey Lewis and the News be Marty's favorite band. Though flattered, Lewis did not want to participate because he did not know how to write film songs and did not want to write one called \"Back to the Future\". Zemeckis assured Lewis he could write any song he wanted. Lewis agreed to submit the next song he wrote, which was \"The Power of Love\".[6] Lewis maintains \"Power of Love\" was his first submission, but Zemeckis recalled a different first song that was rejected.[97][98] Lewis later acquiesced to Zemeckis's request for a second song, \"Back in Time\".[6]\n\nMusician Eddie Van Halen performed the guitar riff Marty (dressed as \"Darth Vader\") uses to wake George. The filmmakers wanted to use Van Halen's music, but the band refused to take part, so Eddie took part on his own. Mark Campbell provided Marty's singing voice, but did not receive credit, as the filmmakers wanted to pretend Fox was singing. When music supervisor Bones Howe learned of this, he secured Campbell a small percentage of the soundtrack revenue as compensation.[89][99] Paul Hanson taught Fox how to use a guitar to play \"Johnny B. Goode\", and choreographer Brad Jeffries spent four weeks teaching Fox to replicate various rock star moves popularized by artists like Pete Townshend, Jimi Hendrix, and Chuck Berry.[100][101] Berry withheld permission to use \"Johnny B. Goode\" until the day before filming, receiving $50,000 for the rights.[102] Harry Waters Jr. provided the vocals on \"Earth Angel\".[103]\n\n## Design\n\n### Special effects\n\nIndustrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) developed the film's special effects under the supervision of Ken Ralston and Kevin Pike.[2][104] It contains approximately 27–32 special effects shots, compared to the 300 such shots typical in contemporaneous higher-budget films.[2][7][85] Despite working simultaneously on The Goonies and Cocoon, Ralston took on the additional project because it required relatively few effects, and he wanted to realize the planned ending of Marty driving the time machine into a nuclear explosion.[2][85] The team had a nine-and-a-half-week schedule, reduced to less than nine once Universal Pictures moved up the release date. ILM was working on Back to the Future up to the moment it had to be handed over to print the theatrical film reels.[2][105]\n\nThe tight schedule affected the special effects' quality. Ralston was disappointed by the scene where Marty's hand fades away as his future is altered. Fox was filmed separately from his hand and the two were composited together; the hand was filmed with a wide-angle lens, making it appear too large, and it had to be scaled down. Zemeckis wanted a subtle fade, but it resulted in a small circle of the hand fading away and there was no time to fix it.[2][106] In the same scene, Marty and his siblings fade away from a photo. ILM found it difficult to fade the photo's individual aspects, especially as it was moving on the neck of a guitar. A replica of the guitar neck was constructed at four times the normal size; the guitar strings were made of cable up to a quarter-inch thick. An 11-by-14 aluminum plate was attached to hold the enlarged photograph. ILM used a version of the photo without Marty or his siblings and individually pasted each character into the photo. When this failed, four different photos were used: one containing the background, and one for each McFly sibling. A mechanical camera cycled through each photo and printed it to the film.[106] The enlarged guitar was moved around to add to the realism.[2]\n\nThe original nuclear explosion ending was considered too complicated and expensive, with an estimated cost of $1 million.[2][15][17] Art director Andrew Probert storyboarded the scene, which would have been created using sets and miniatures.[15][106] With the ending moved to the clock tower, ILM researched storms to achieve the right aesthetic.[106] Clouds were constructed from polyester fiberfill, suspended in a net, and filmed from above while Ralston shone a powerful light from below.[83] He used a rheostat to rapidly change the lights' intensity to imitate lightning.[83]\n\nDeveloped by Wes Takahashi's animation department, the lightning bolt that strikes the clock tower was described as \"the largest bolt of lightning in cinematic history\". It was intended to originate in the distance and move closer, but the footage was filmed too close to the tower and there was insufficient space between it and the top of the frame.[107] There was also an issue with showing the bolt onscreen for too long as it made it more obviously animated.[83][107] The frame count was reduced, but the bolt did not look chaotic enough.[83] Zemeckis picked out a single frame of the bolt in an \"S\" formation and asked that the effect focus on that shape and be reduced to twenty frames.[83][107] The bolt was drawn in black ink on white paper; diffusion effects and a glow were added by the optical department.[107]\n\n### The DeLorean time machine\n\nThe DeLorean time machine on display in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe DeLorean was developed under the supervision of Lawrence Paull,[104] who designed it with artist Ron Cobb and illustrator Andrew Probert.[24][108] They intended for the vehicle to look fixed together from common parts.[104] The time machine was originally conceived as a stationary device; at one point it was a refrigerator. Spielberg vetoed the idea, concerned child viewers might attempt to climb into one.[15] Zemeckis suggested the DeLorean because it offered mobility and a unique design; the gull-wing doors would appear like an alien UFO to a 1950s family.[9][10][11] The Ford Motor Company offered $75,000 to use a Ford Mustang instead; Gale responded, \"Doc Brown doesn't drive a fucking Mustang\".[10] Michael Fink was hired as the art department liaison and tasked with realizing Cobb's sketches and overseeing the car's construction. He was recruited by Paull and Canton, who had worked with him on Blade Runner (1982) and Buckaroo Banzai, respectively. Fink had a project lined up but agreed to help in the free weeks he had remaining.[104] Three DeLoreans used were purchased from a collector: one for stunts, one for special effects, and a more detailed hero version for close-up shots.[108][109] They were unreliable and often broke down.[10] 88 miles per hour (142 kilometers per hour) was chosen as the time travel speed because it was easy to remember and looked \"cool\" on the speedometer.[102]\n\nThe flying DeLorean in the final scene used a combination of live-action footage, animation, and a 1:5 scale (approximately 33 inches (840 millimeters) long) model built by Steve Gawley and the model shop crew.[2][110][2] The act of the DeLorean traveling through time was called the 'time slice' effect. Zemeckis knew only that he wanted the transition to be violent. He described it as a \"Neanderthal sitting on the hood of the DeLorean and chipping away the fabric of time in front of him\".[107] The effect is so quick as to be imperceptible. Zemeckis preferred this, as he did not want the audience to think too much about how everything worked.[111]\n\n### Art direction and makeup\n\nArtist Drew Struzan in 2012. He designed the Back to the Future theatrical release poster.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActual brand names, such as Texaco, were used to make the sets more realistic, and the producers mandated the inclusion of certain brands that had paid to appear in the film. An unidentified gas company offered a large sum to be included, but Paull used Texaco because it reminded him of a joke from The Milton Berle Show.[9][112] This choice led to some disputes, such as Pepsi parent company, PepsiCo, wanting to omit a joke about the Tab drink made by its rival Coca-Cola.[9] Twenty clock wranglers were needed to synch up the many clocks in the opening scene, and pulleys were used to start them simultaneously.[102] Drew Struzan produced the film's poster.[113] The producers hoped his in-demand poster artwork would generate further interest in the film.[114]\n\nThe film uses a stylized adaptation of the 1950s aesthetics, closer to television show interpretations than an exact recreation. Modern technologies such as contemporary fabrics were used because the designers believed the fashions of the time were not interesting.[20] To represent characters across three decades, the filmmakers did not want to have older actors stand in for the younger ones, believing the change would be obvious and distracting. Special effects artist Ken Chase performed makeup tests on the young actors to age them; initial results were discouraging. He created a prosthetic neck and a bald cap with a receding hairline for Glover but considered them excessive. Chase found it difficult to balance aging the actors and retaining enough of their natural appearance to remain recognizable.[108]\n\nCasts were made of the actors' faces, from which plaster molds were made. Chase sculpted more subtle effects over the plaster molds using latex. For Lorraine, he crafted jowls and eye bags, plus body padding to reflect her increased weight and alcohol abuse.[115] Instead of a receding hairline, Chase changed the style of George's hair; he used prosthetics only to give him a less-defined jawline.[116] Biff's character changed more significantly because Chase wanted him to look \"obnoxious\"; he was fattened, given sideburns, and a comb over hairstyle to hide a growing bald spot.[116] The prosthetics were combined with makeup and lighting to further age the characters.[108]\n\nChase found the work frustrating compared to his experiences with more fantastical prostheses that made it easier to hide defects.[108] The rubber latex did not reflect light the same way as natural skin, so Chase used a stippling process (creating a pattern with small dots) to variegate the actors' faces to better conceal where the skin and prosthetics met;[116] close-up shots were avoided.[116] Doc's appearance was not altered significantly. Chase painted latex on Lloyd which, when removed, caused crinkles in the skin, onto which other elements, such as liver spots and shadows, were painted.[116]\n\n## Release\n\n### Context\n\nThe logo for Back to the Future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy June 1985, the theatrical industry had experienced a 14% decline in ticket sales over the previous year's $4 billion record sales. The summer period (beginning the final week of May) had 45 films scheduled for release, including Rambo: First Blood Part II, The Goonies, Brewster's Millions, Fletch, and the latest James Bond film A View to a Kill.[117] This 25% increase over the previous year's releases led to concerns among industry professionals the competition would divide audiences and limit financial returns, at a time when the average cost of making and marketing a film had increased to $14.5 million and $7 million, respectively.[117] A higher budget to secure a popular, and thus profitable, cast was considered a suitable risk.[117] Most films scheduled for release were aimed at younger audiences, focusing on fantasy and the supernatural. Reflecting the times, these fantasy elements often employed a technological source instead of a magical one.[118] Only a few films, like Cocoon and Prizzi's Honor, targeted adults.[119]\n\nInitially, Back to the Future was scheduled to be released in May 1985,[120] but was pushed back to June 21, the earliest Zemeckis could have the film ready. The delay caused by Stoltz's replacement pushed the release back to July 19, and later to August.[10] Sheinberg moved the release date forward to July 3, giving it an extra sixteen days of theatrical screen time during the industry's most profitable period of the year. The move offered about 100,000 extra screenings, together worth an estimated $40 million. He said he also wanted to avoid the negative perception of films released later in the summer period; other blockbuster films were usually released early.[66] The change required renegotiations with theater owners to secure screens in an already-crowded marketplace. In some cities, it was legally required that exhibitors be shown a film before purchase; an unfinished cut of the film was shown to theater owners and young test audiences. They described it as lesser than E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial or Ghostbusters, but still a guaranteed box office hit.[66] Fox was unavailable for promotional work because he was filming Family Ties Vacation (1985) in London.[121]\n\n### Box office\n\nIn the United States (U.S.) and Canada, Back to the Future received a wide release on July 3, 1985, ahead of the Independence Day holiday weekend.[5][122] The film earned $3.6 million during the opening Wednesday and Thursday,[122] and a further $11.3 million during its inaugural weekend from 1,420 theaters – an average of $7,853 per theater.[123] Back to the Future finished as the number one film of the weekend ahead of Western Pale Rider ($7 million), in its second weekend, and Rambo: First Blood Part II ($6.4 million) in its seventh.[124] It retained the number one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $10.6 million, ahead of the debuting action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ($7.8 million) and Cocoon ($5 million),[125] and in its third weekend, ahead of the re-release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ($8.8 million) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ($5.4 million).[126] Although it fell to number two in its fourth weekend, behind the debuting National Lampoon's European Vacation ($12.3 million), Back to the Future regained the number one position in its fifth weekend and remained there for the following eight weeks.[123][127] Recalling the opening weeks, Gale said, \"our second weekend was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great word of mouth.\"[9]\n\nThe film remained a steady success, earning $155 million by October, surpassing Rambo: First Blood Part II's $149 million box office earnings to become the year's highest-grossing film.[128][119] In total, Back to the Future was the number one film for eleven of its twelve first weeks and remained in the top ten highest-grossing films for a total of twenty-four.[123] By the end of its theatrical run, Back to the Future earned an approximate box office gross of $210.6 million,[96][f] making it the highest-grossing film of 1985, ahead of Rambo: First Blood Part II ($150.4 million), the sports drama Rocky IV ($127.9 million), and the drama The Color Purple ($94.2 million).[129][130] Box Office Mojo estimated more than 59 million tickets were sold.[131] Industry experts suggest that as of 1997 the box office returns to the studio (minus the theaters' share) was $105.5 million.[132][g]\n\nThe year was considered an unsuccessful one for film. Despite a record number of film releases, ticket sales were down 17% compared with 1984.[119][133] Industry executives blamed the problem, in part, on a lack of originality,[134] and a glut of youth-oriented films targeted at those under 18.[119][135] Only Back to the Future and Rambo: First Blood Part II were considered blockbusters, earning more than double the box office of Cocoon.[119] Films offering escapism and pro-America themes also fared well.[135] After years of poor performances, Back to the Future, alongside Fletch, Brewster's Millions, and Mask, reversed Universal Pictures' fortunes.[135][136]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned a further estimated $170.5 million,[137][h] making it the third-highest-grossing film of the year, behind the romantic drama Out of Africa ($179.1 million) and Rocky IV ($172.6 million).[137] Cumulatively, Back to the Future earned a worldwide gross of $381.1 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1985, ahead of Rocky IV ($300.5 million) and Rambo: First Blood Part II ($300.4 million).[96][138][139][i] Back to the Future has received several theatrical re-releases to celebrate anniversaries, including a remastered version screened in 2010. These releases have raised the film's worldwide total to $388.8 million.[140][141]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin 2008 (left) and  in 2012. Critics praised the central cast, including Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover.\n\nBack to the Future received generally positive reviews from critics.[142][143][144] Most reviewers agreed Back to the Future was among the year's most entertaining films, partly because of its focus on storytelling instead of pure spectacle.[145][146] Paul Attanasio and Gene Siskel argued that while Back to the Future appeared to be \"everything wrong\" with youth-targeted films, it successfully subverted expectations by focusing on a relatable narrative with an emotional core, and employed irreverent, good-natured humor. They, alongside Richard Corliss, agreed that it would endure because it offered something for children and adults.[146][147][148] Some reviewers, such as Corliss and Leonard Maltin agreed that the exposition-heavy opening was Back to the Future's weakest part, but led into a stronger half filled with \"wit\", \"wonder\", \"comic epiphany\", and original ideas.[3][142][147]\n\nDave Kehr remarked that Gale and Zemeckis were among the first generation of filmmakers openly influenced by growing up on televised entertainment, and their inspirations are evident throughout. The Hollywood Reporter said that despite Spielberg's producer role, it was Zemeckis's vision, being more subtle, gentler, and \"less noisy\".[149][150] Some reviewers compared it favorably to the 1946 fantasy drama It's a Wonderful Life, which offered a similar premise of a central character changing his future. Roger Ebert said the film offered humanity, charm, humor, and many surprises that were among its \"greatest pleasures\".[3][150][151] Sheila Benson was more critical; she found Back to the Future to be overproduced and underdeveloped, featuring a hollow ending focused on materialistic rewards and lacking tension because Marty's success never seemed in doubt. Siskel countered that the tension came from defying the expectations of a typical time travel film by making the past mutable and the future uncertain.[148][152] Paul Attanasio criticized some aspects that seemed to be \"mechanically\" designed to create the broadest audience appeal.[145][146]\n\nThe cast performances were generally well received, particularly those of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover.[118][146][150] Reviewers consistently praised Fox's \"appealing\" performance, although some believed Lloyd's performance outshone the rest.[j] Kehr and Attanasio considered his uncontrolled performance and unique \"intensity\" a tribute to mad scientist characters, portrayed by the likes of Sid Caesar and John Belushi, while creating the definitive scientist archetype for modern audiences.[146][149][150] In contrast, Vincent Canby and Variety's review said that Thompson's \"deceptively passionate\" performance and Glover's bumbling-to-confident character provided Back to the Future's standout performances.[3][118] Some reviewers considered the use of Libyan terrorists, an actual fear at the time, to be in poor taste.[150][152]\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[153]\n\n### Accolades\n\nBack to the Future received four nominations at the 43rd Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Actor in a Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) (Fox), Best Original Song (\"The Power of Love\"), and Best Screenplay (Gale and Zemeckis).[11][154] The film was also named Favorite Motion Picture at the 12th People's Choice Awards.[155] At the 1986 Academy Awards, Back to the Future received one award for Best Sound Effects Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Robert Rutledge). It received a further three nominations: Best Original Screenplay (Gale and Zemeckis); Best Sound (Bill Varney, B. Tennyson Sebastian II, Robert Thirlwell, and William B. Kaplan); and Best Original Song (\"The Power of Love\").[156]\n\nAt the 39th British Academy Film Awards, Back to the Future received five nominations, including Best Film, Best Original Screenplay (Gale and Zemeckis), Best Visual Effects (Pike and Ralston), Best Production Design (Paull), and Best Editing (Schmidt and Keramidas).[157] At the 13th Saturn Awards, the film won three awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor (Fox), and Best Special Effects (Pike).[158] It also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[159] Back to the Future performed well internationally: it won Best Foreign Producer (Spielberg) and Best Foreign Screenplay at the David di Donatello awards (Italy), Outstanding Foreign Film from the Japan Academy, and the Goldene Leinwand (Germany) for selling more than three million tickets in its first eighteen months.[160]\n\n## Post-release\n\n### Home media\n\nBack to the Future was released on VHS on May 22, 1986, priced at $79.95,[161][162] becoming the first film to sell 450,000 units at that price point, and was also the most-rented cassette of the year.[163][164] A sequel was not planned until after Back to the Future's theatrical release, and a \"To Be Continued ...\" graphic was appended to the end of the home release to promote awareness of future films.[165] When Back to the Future was released on DVD in 2002, the graphic was removed because Gale and Zemeckis wanted it to be faithful to an in-theater experience.[162][165][166] It debuted on Blu-ray in 2010 for the film's 25th anniversary. The release featured a six-part documentary including interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and associated music videos from all three films. The release also included the public debut of footage of Stoltz portraying Marty McFly.[k] For its 35th anniversary in 2020, a remastered 4K Ultra HD version was released on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray. Along with extras included in previous releases, this edition included audition footage and an exploration of the film's props hosted by Gale. Limited edition steel bookcases and a display replicate of the levitating hoverboard from Back to the Future Part II were also available.[168]\n\nThe Back to the Future soundtrack was released in July 1985 on cassette tape, LP record, and compact disc (CD).[169] The soundtrack's lead single, \"The Power of Love\", peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Sales were initially slow, but it eventually peaked at number twelve on the Billboard 200, in part because of the success of \"The Power of Love\".[170] Silvestri's score received a limited release in 2009 on CD, containing the film score and unreleased variations.[171] The scores for all three Back to the Future films were first released on LP record in 2016, individually and as a collection. Silvestri supervised the remaster of the original master recordings, including previously unreleased tracks, and Gale contributed liner notes.[172]\n\n### Other media\n\nBack to the Future: The Ride at Universal Studios Japan in 2011\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 1985, film merchandising was a relatively new concept, popularized by the original Star Wars film trilogy (1977–1983).[173] As Back to the Future was not specifically aimed at children, there was no significant merchandising accompanying its release.[174] Although a novelization by George Gipe was released in 1985,[175] one of the earliest items for children, a rideable DeLorean, was not released until 1986.[174] The film and its sequels have since been represented across a wide variety of merchandise including: Playmobil, playing cards, clothing, pottery, posters,[176] board games,[176][177] sculpted figures, plush toys,[177] Funko POP! figures, action figures,[174] Hot Wheels and die-cast vehicles,[174][178] books, music albums,[179] and Christmas ornaments.[178]\n\nBack to the Future received several video game adaptations. Back to the Future was released alongside the film for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum.[180][181][182] An arcade-adventure game, Back to the Future, was released in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Gale called it one of the worst games ever made and advised people against purchasing it.[181][183] Back to the Future: The Pinball was released in 1990, although Fox refused permission for the game to use his likeness.[183] An episodic graphic adventure game, Back to the Future: The Game, was released in 2010. Gale contributed to the game's narrative, which takes place after the events of the third film.[183][184] An area in Lego Dimensions is based on Back to the Future and features voice work by Lloyd.[183][185]\n\nBack to the Future: The Ride, a simulator ride, ran from 1991 to 2007 at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. The ride's development was supervised by Spielberg and featured Doc Brown (Lloyd) chasing down Biff (Wilson) who has stolen the DeLorean. A version of the ride at Universal Studios Japan ran from 2001 to 2016.[184][186] A Back to the Future-themed Monopoly board game was released in 2015.[176][187] A Funko board game was released in 2020. It casts players as one of the main characters from the films to battle different Tannens across history.[177][188]\n\nThere have been several books about the making of the film series. We Don't Need Roads: The Making of the Back to the Future Trilogy is an oral history by those involved in the production.[186] Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History, a book chronicling the development of the entire Back to the Future franchise, was released in 2015.[189] The British Film Institute released BFI Film Classics: Back to the Future about the film's background.[179] The series also includes comic books detailing Doc's and Marty's adventures before and after the events depicted in the films.[190] A crossover between the Back to the Future and Transformers franchises included a transforming DeLorean toy and associated comic books.[191]\n\n## Thematic analysis\n\n### Parental relationships and fate\n\nThe main theme of Back to the Future concerns taking control and personal responsibility over one's destiny: A situation can be changed even if it seems otherwise impossible to overcome.[9] Thompson said the film represents how one moment can have a significant and lasting impact on a person's life.[14][45] Gale believed Doc provided the perfect summary of the series' running theme, when in Back to the Future Part III he said: \"Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.\"[9]\n\nAt the start of the film, Marty is rejected at Battle of the Bands and admits he fears his ambitions will remain unrealized. He worries he will end up like his parents and sees direct evidence in 1955 of George, also afraid of rejection, and being unable to approach Lorraine; his fears risk Marty's future.[89][192] Marty sets about manipulating the past to ensure his survival without concern for what impact his presence in 1955 is having on others. On his return to 1985, he is rewarded with wealthier parents and a nicer car, but he has simultaneously damaged Biff's future, reducing him to a valet for the McFlys.[46][193] Glover criticized the morality of the film's ending, believing Marty's reward should be happy parents in love with each other, and considered it a result of the film serving corporate interests, promoting the accumulation of wealth and purchasing material objects.[46] In 2015, Zemeckis said the ending was perfect for its time but would be different if he made it now, although Gale disagreed and said he did not apologize for the scene. American audiences generally had no issue with this ending, but it was criticized by some international audiences.[194]\n\nDespite rejection by film studios for not being raunchy enough,[10] Back to the Future alludes to sexual assault, racism, and the Oedipus complex – a psychiatric theory suggesting a child holds an unconscious sexual desire for their opposite-sexed parent, as in the relationship between Marty and his future mother Lorraine in 1955.[118][193] The relationships between parents and children are the basis of many elements of the film. Thompson believed the film had remained relevant to new generations because of its core idea that Marty's and the viewer's parents were once children and had the same dreams and ambitions they do.[14][19][45]\n\n### Reaganism and American anxieties\n\n(Left to right) Nancy McKeon, Michael J. Fox, Nancy Reagan, and U.S. President Ronald Reagan in October 1985. Back to the Future has been interpreted as an endorsement of Reagan-era policies concerning the American dream, self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCritics Justin Chang and Mark Olsen suggest the film can be seen as promoting Reaganism – the political positions of president Ronald Reagan – which endorses older values of the American dream, initiative, and technological advancement. The Hill Valley of 1985 is depicted as run down and in decay, while in 1955 it is presented as a more simplistic and seemingly safer time, seen through a nostalgic lens.[193] Marty's future is bettered because he goes back to 1955 and teaches George to be more assertive and self-reliant; his initiative leads to a more prosperous future for Marty with materialistic rewards.[192][193] The film uses many brand names of the time, ostensibly to make the setting more realistic, e.g. Mountain Dew, Pepsi, and Texaco, but the filmmakers received financial compensation from the brand owners, making their inclusion promotional and commercialistic instead of artistic.[9][192]\n\nFilm studies lecturer Sorcha Ní Fhlainn argues that many 1980s films resulted from the American public's desire for escapism from cultural anxieties and fears, including nuclear proliferation, unemployment, crime, growing inequality, and the AIDS crisis. In her view, films like those of the Star Wars series and Back to the Future offered a childlike reassurance of safety and comfort, emphasizing idealized American values and the positive effects of instilling power in a patriarchal figure like George McFly or Darth Vader.[195] English professor Susan Jeffords considered Doc Brown to be an analog for Reagan, a man who embraces technological advancement, who conflicts with Libyan terrorists and provides the means for a failing family to better themselves.[196]\n\nThe song \"Johnny B. Goode\" by Chuck Berry is used during the film's final act. Berry initially resisted allowing the song to be used in the film. NPR argued that while Berry's resistance may have been a matter of money, there are underlying racial issues involved in Marty, a white male, seemingly rewriting history to invent the rock and roll music genre, which was heavily influenced by African-American music.[186][193] The 1955 segment also presents a distorted view of America, showing an African-American band playing at the high school dance, which would have been disallowed.[152] Similarly, the African-American character Goldie Wilson is seemingly inspired to work towards becoming mayor by Marty's intervention, inspiring a Reagan-style initiative and self-reliance.[192]\n\n### Influences\n\nAs film fans, Gale and Zemeckis's influences are seen throughout Back to the Future. There are references to The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Shaggy Dog (1959), Dr. Strangelove (1964), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), the Star Wars film series, and television shows including Mister Peabody, Star Trek: The Original Series, The Outer Limits, and The Twilight Zone.[19][89] There are also allusions to 1960's The Time Machine (based on H. G. Wells's 1895 novella of the same name) and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, in which the central character seemingly moves through time.[197] The DeLorean dashboard chronometer uses the same color scheme as the time device of The Time Machine.[198] Critic Ray Loynd opined that Doc can be seen as a King Arthur-type, with Marty serving as his knight.[3]\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Cultural influence\n\nThomas F. Wilson in 2011. He began carrying cards containing answers to the repetitive questions he was asked by fans about the Back to the Future series.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince its release, Back to the Future has remained an enduring popular culture touchstone,[186] and in 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.[199] The film elevated Fox from a financially struggling actor to one of the most in-demand and globally recognized stars in Hollywood,[200][34] and Gale received fan mail for decades after its release. He said he understood the continuing appreciation for the original film as it was the \"purest\" and \"most complete\" in the series.[9] Fox compared it to The Wizard of Oz (1939), saying it still appeals to children because they do not think of it as an old film.[201] In 2012, Thompson called it the greatest role of her career.[45] Dean Cundey believed it resonated with fans because it offers the fantasy of going back in time to change things and make the present better.[14][202] Lloyd described being approached by fans from around the world, who have said the film inspired them to become a scientist.[203]\n\nMany of the principal cast have reunited since the film's release. Often these reunions are for charity, including The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's disease (Fox was diagnosed with the disease at age 29), and Project HOPE.[l] A 2019 reunion for the TCM Classic Film Festival featured the 4K restoration premiere of Back to the Future.[207] During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Josh Gad hosted a Back to the Future retrospective featuring many cast and crew.[208] The cast has also appeared in advertisements only loosely related to Back to the Future, trading on their associated popularity.[209]\n\nThe film has global popular appeal, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Japan.[210] On October 21, 2015 (the day Doc and Marty travel to at the end of Back to the Future, as depicted in Back to the Future II) an estimated 27 million social media users discussed the films; the most active users were in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil.[186][211] Ronald Reagan was also a fan, referring to the film during his 1986 State of the Union Address to appeal to America's young voters, saying, \"Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film Back to the Future, 'Where we're going, we don't need roads.'\"[186][212][213] Although Gale has said that Reagan, after enjoying the joke about Doc Brown's incredulous response to him becoming president, ordered the theater's projectionist to stop the film, roll it back, and run it again, this is disputed by Reagan's advisor, Mark Weinberg.[192][214][215] Back to the Future is also seen as responsible for a resurgence of skateboarding in the 1980s.[216][19] It made skateboarding a mainstream pastime acceptable for all, not just rebellious teenagers.[217]\n\nBack to the Future has been referred to in a variety of media, including television,[155][218] films,[219][220] and video games.[221][222] Doc and Marty, respectively, inspired the eponymous characters of the 2013 animated television show Rick and Morty.[223] The British pop rock band McFly are named for Marty McFly.[224] The 2011 novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and the 2018 film adaptation (directed by Spielberg) both heavily refer to the film, including the central character using a DeLorean for transport.[225][226] Filmmaker J. J. Abrams has also cited it as an inspiration.[52]\n\nThe 2015 crowdfunded documentary Back in Time follows various fans of the series and details the impact it has had on their lives, interspersed with interviews from the crew including Fox and Lloyd.[227] The DeLorean is considered one of the most iconic vehicles in film history.[228] DeLorean's creator John DeLorean was a fan of the film and sent personal letters to Gale and Zemeckis, thanking them for using his vehicle.[10] The DeLorean was not a popular vehicle before the film's release. However, in the years since it has become a popular collector's item, the DeLorean Motor Company issued kits enabling fans to make their vehicle look like the DeLorean time machine.[38][184] Gale led a restoration of one of the original screen-used DeLoreans in 2011, documented in Out of Time: Saving the DeLorean Time Machine.[184][229][230]\n\n### Modern reception\n\nChristopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox discussing the film at the 2022 New York Comic Con\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBack to the Future is considered a landmark of American cinema, and one of the greatest films ever made.[m] In 2004, The New York Times listed it as one of the 1,000 Best Movies Ever,[233] and the following year its screenplay was listed as the 56th greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years by the Writers Guild of America.[234][235] Throughout the rest of the 2000s, it appeared on Film4's 50 Films to See Before You Die (number 10),[236] Empire's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time (number 23), behind the 1977 space opera Star Wars,[231] and the American Film Institute listed it as the number 10 best science fiction film, based on a poll of fifteen hundred people from the creative community.[237] In 2010, Total Film named it one of the 100 greatest movies ever made, and the following year it was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their fourth favorite film of all time.[238][239] It is also listed in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.[240] A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by The Hollywood Reporter ranked it as the 12th best film of all time, again behind Star Wars.[232] In 2015, the screenplay was listed as the 67th funniest on the WGA's 101 Funniest Screenplays list,[241][242] and Rotten Tomatoes also listed the film at number 84 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch.[243]\n\nSeveral publications have named it as one of the best science fiction films ever made,[n] and one of the best films of the 1980s.[o] Popular Mechanics and Rolling Stone listed it as the number one and number four best time-travel film ever made respectively.[271][272] Entertainment Weekly named it the 40th most essential film to be watched by pre-teens and the 28th best high-school movie.[273][274] Marty McFly appeared at number 39 on Empire's 2006 list of its \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\"; Doc Brown followed at number 76.[275][276]\n\nRotten Tomatoes assesses a 93% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 112 critics, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, Back to the Future is a rousing time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.\"[277] Based on this score, Rotten Tomatoes also listed it as the 87th best Action and Adventure film.[278] The film has a score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[279] In the United Kingdom, readers of Empire voted the film as 11th on their 2017 list of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\".[280]\n\n## Sequels and adaptations\n\nA sequel was not initially planned, and the teaser ending of Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying off in the DeLorean suggested their adventures would continue off-screen.[89] Universal Pictures was eager to pursue a sequel based on the significant financial and critical success of Back to the Future. However, Zemeckis and Gale were reluctant to participate, believing sequels often retreaded the best elements of the original film. They were also concerned that a poor follow-up could alienate Back to the Future's passionate fan base, and undermine the pair after their first major joint success. Zemeckis and Gale acquiesced by 1987, once Universal Pictures clarified they would, if necessary, make a sequel without them.[281] The pair's sequel script was so long it was split into two films, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990); the films were shot back to back.[14][282]\n\nPart II depicts Marty and Doc traveling to 2015, inadvertently enabling the now-elderly Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and return to 1955, rewriting history in his favor.[282] Wells and Glover did not return for the sequels.[p] Part II was a financial success but was criticized for its complex, convoluted narrative.[284] Zemeckis has said it is his least favorite film in the series.[282] The final film, Part III follows Marty as he travels to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc.[285] While the film fared less well financially than the two earlier films, it was more critically well-received than Part II.[284] A 2018 poll by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,200 people found 71% wanted a Back to the Future sequel, ahead of another Toy Story or Indiana Jones film.[286] Gale has said there will never be a fourth film, likening it to \"selling your kids into prostitution\". He added a Back to the Future film could never happen without Fox, who could not participate because of the effects of his Parkinson's disease.[287][288]\n\nAn animated television series, Back to the Future, aired on CBS between 1991 and 1992. It follows Doc's and Marty's adventures through various historical periods, intercut with live-action segments featuring Doc (Lloyd), performing science experiments alongside Bill Nye.[184] A short film, Doc Brown Saves the World (2015), celebrated the film's 30th anniversary. Lloyd reprised his role as Doc, who must travel to the future to prevent a nuclear holocaust in 2045.[289] A musical theater production, Back to the Future, debuted in February 2020 at the Manchester Opera House, England, to positive reviews. The musical was written by Gale and Zemeckis, with music written by Silvestri and Glen Ballard.[290][291][292] Gale described it as the best way to give fans more Back to the Future without adding to the film series.[287] In 2024, Zemeckis said he was interested in adapting the musical into a movie.[293] Overall, the Back to the Future franchise is considered one of the most successful film franchises in history.[19][190]\n\n## References\n\n### Notes\n\n- ^ As depicted in Back to the Future Part II (1989)\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[14][15][16][17]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[9][14][22][26]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[7][16][24][33][36][37][38][39]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[7][38][41][42]\n- ^ The 1985 United States and Canada box office gross of $210.6 million is equivalent to $616 million in 2024.\n- ^ The estimated returns to the studio from the United States and Canada box office gross is $105.5 million, equivalent to $308 million in 2024.\n- ^ The 1985 worldwide box office gross of $170.5 million is equivalent to $498 million in 2024.\n- ^ The 1985 worldwide box office gross of $381.1 million is equivalent to $1.11 billion in 2024.\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[142][146][148][150]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[19][140][167]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[58][204][205][206]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[11][186][193][231][232]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[244][245][246][247][248][249][250][251][252][253][254][255]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[256][257][258][259][260][261][262][263][264][265][266][267][268][269][270]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[7][46][186][283]\n\n### Citations\n\n- ^ Levy, Emanuel (October 2, 2015). \"Back To The Future: Revisiting 1985's Most Popular Film, Directed By Robert Zemeckis And Starring Michael J.

It stars <MainCharacters>Michael J. Fox</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Christopher Lloyd</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Lea Thompson</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Crispin Glover</MainCharacters>, and <MainCharacters>Thomas F. Wilson</MainCharacters>. Set in 1985, it follows <MainCharacters>Marty McFly</MainCharacters> (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend <MainCharacters>Emmett \"Doc\" Brown</MainCharacters> (Lloyd), where he inadvertently prevents his future parents from falling in love – threatening his own existence – and is forced to reconcile them and somehow get back to the future.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Production>\n        Gale and Zemeckis conceived the idea for Back to the Future in 1980. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, but the project was rejected more than forty times by various studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. A development deal was secured with Universal Pictures following Zemeckis's success directing Romancing the Stone (1984). Fox was the first choice to portray Marty but was unavailable; Eric Stoltz was cast instead. Shortly after principal photography began in November 1984, Zemeckis determined Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox, including re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4 million to the budget. Back to the Future was filmed in and around California and on sets at Universal Studios, and concluded the following April.\n    </Production>\n    \n    <Release>\n        After highly successful test screenings, the release date was brought forward to <ReleaseYear>July 3, 1985</ReleaseYear>, giving the film more time in theaters during the busiest period of the theatrical year. The change resulted in a rushed post-production schedule and some incomplete special effects. Back to the Future was a critical and commercial success, earning <BoxOffice>$381.1 million</BoxOffice> to become the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. Critics praised the story, humor, and the cast, particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an <Awards>Academy Award</Awards>, three <Awards>Saturn Awards</Awards>, and a <Awards>Hugo Award</Awards>. Its theme song, \"The Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis and the News, was also a success.\n    </Release>\n    \n    <Reception>\n        Back to the Future has since grown in esteem and is now considered by critics and audiences to be one of the greatest science fiction films and among the best films ever made. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. The film was followed by two sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990). Spurred by the film's dedicated fan following and effect on popular culture, Universal Studios launched a multimedia franchise, which now includes video games, theme park rides, an animated television series, and a stage musical. Its enduring popularity has prompted numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials.\n    </Reception>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to include the relevant XML tags based on the attributes specified in the ADT.

Look Up is a 2021 American political satire black comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by Adam McKay from a story he co-wrote with David Sirota.[1] It stars an ensemble cast featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Mark Rylance, Tyler Perry, Timothée Chalamet, Ron Perlman, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Cate Blanchett, and Meryl Streep. The film tells the story of two astronomers attempting to warn humanity about an approaching comet that will destroy human civilization. The impact event is an allegory for climate change, and the film is a satire of government, political, celebrity, and media indifference to the climate crisis.[6][7]\n\nProduced by McKay's Hyperobject Industries and Bluegrass Films, the film was announced in November 2019. Originally set for a theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, the distribution rights were acquired by Netflix several months later. Lawrence became the first member of the cast to join, with DiCaprio signing on after his discussions with McKay on adjustments to the script; the rest of the cast was added through 2020. Filming was initially set to begin in April 2020 in Massachusetts, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it eventually began in November 2020 and wrapped in February 2021.[8][9]\n\nDon't Look Up began a limited theatrical release on December 10, 2021, before streaming on Netflix on December 24. It was praised for the cast's performances and the musical score, but critics were divided on the merits of McKay's satire; some found it deft, while others criticized it as smug and heavy-handed. Don't Look Up was named one of the top ten films of 2021 by the National Board of Review and American Film Institute. It received four Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), four Golden Globe Award nominations (including Best Picture – Musical or Comedy), six Critics' Choice Award nominations, (including Best Picture), and also won Best Original Screenplay at the 74th Writers Guild of America Awards. The film set a new record for the most viewing hours in a single week on Netflix, and went on to become the second-most-watched movie on Netflix within 28 days of release.\n\n## Plot\n\nKate Dibiasky, a doctoral candidate in astronomy at Michigan State University, discovers an unknown comet. Her professor, Doctor Randall Mindy, confirms that it will collide with Earth in approximately six months and is large enough to cause a global extinction event. NASA verifies the findings, and Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe, head of their Planetary Defense Coordination Office, accompanies Dibiasky and Mindy to present their findings to the White House. However, they are met with apathy from President Janie Orlean and her Chief of Staff Jason Orlean, who is also her son.\n\nOglethorpe encourages Dibiasky and Mindy to leak the news to the media, which they then do, on The Daily Rip, a popular morning talk show. When hosts Jack Bremmer and Brie Evantee treat the topic lightly, Dibiasky loses her temper and angrily rants about the threat before she flees the scene. Mindy receives public approval for his looks, while Dibiasky becomes the subject of negative memes for her on-air behavior. Actual news about the comet's threat receives little public attention, and the danger is denied by Orlean's NASA Director Jocelyn Calder, a top donor to Orlean with no background in astronomy. When news of Orlean's sex scandal with her Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon is exposed, she distracts from the bad publicity by finally confirming the threat and announcing a project to strike and divert the comet using nuclear weapons.\n\nThe mission successfully launches, but Orlean abruptly aborts it when Peter Isherwell, the billionaire CEO of BASH Cellular and another top donor, discovers that the comet contains trillions of dollars worth of rare-earth elements. The White House agrees to commercially exploit the comet by fragmenting and recovering it from the ocean, using technology proposed by BASH in a scheme that has not undergone peer review. Orlean sidelines Dibiasky and Oglethorpe while hiring Mindy as the National Science Advisor. Dibiasky attempts to mobilize public opposition to the scheme but gives up under threat from Orlean's administration. Mindy becomes a prominent voice advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities and begins an affair with Evantee.\n\nWorld opinion is divided among people who believe the comet is a severe threat, those who decry alarmism and believe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and those who deny that the comet even exists. When Dibiasky returns home to Illinois, her parents kick her out of the house and she begins a relationship with a young man named Yule, a shoplifter she meets at her retail job. After Mindy's wife confronts him about his infidelity, she returns to Michigan without him. Mindy questions whether Isherwell's technology will be able to break apart the comet, angering the billionaire. Becoming frustrated with the administration, Mindy finally breaks down and rants on national television, criticizing Orlean for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questioning humanity's indifference.\n\nCut off from the administration, Mindy reconciles with Dibiasky as the comet becomes visible from Earth. Mindy, Dibiasky, and Oglethorpe organize a protest campaign on social media, telling people to \"Just Look Up\" and call on other countries to conduct comet interception operations. Simultaneously, Orlean starts an anti-campaign telling people \"Don't Look Up\". Orlean and BASH cut Russia, India, and China out of the rights for the comet-mining deal, so they prepare their own joint deflection mission, only for their spacecraft to explode. As the comet becomes larger in the sky, Orlean's supporters start turning on her administration. BASH's attempt at breaking the comet apart goes awry and everyone realizes that humanity is doomed.\n\nIsherwell, Orlean, and others in their elite circle board a sleeper spaceship designed to find an Earth-like planet, inadvertently leaving Jason behind. Orlean offers Mindy two places on the ship, but he declines, choosing to spend a final evening with his friends and family. As expected, the comet strikes off the coast of Chile, causing a worldwide disaster and triggering an extinction-level event. In a mid-credits scene, the 2,000 people who left Earth before the comet's impact land on a lush alien planet 22,740 years later, ending their period of suspended animation. They exit their spacecraft naked and admire the habitable world. However, Orlean is suddenly killed by a bird-like predator (a death predicted by BASH's algorithms), one of a pack that surrounds the planetary newcomers. In a post-credits scene back on Earth, it is revealed that Jason managed to survive the impact. He records himself, declaring himself the \"last man on Earth\" and asking any viewers still alive to \"like and subscribe\".\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film stars  (left) and  (right) as astronomers who discover the planet-killing comet\n\n- Leonardo DiCaprio as Dr. Randall Mindy, an astronomy professor at Michigan State University (MSU) and Kate's teacher\n- Jennifer Lawrence as Kate Dibiasky, an MSU doctoral candidate in astronomy\n- Meryl Streep as Janie Orlean, the President of the United States.

Lawrence became the first member of the cast to join, with DiCaprio signing on after his discussions with McKay on adjustments to the script; the rest of the cast was added through 2020.\n\nThis movie came from my burgeoning terror about the climate crisis and the fact that we live in a society that tends to place it as the fourth or fifth news story, or in some cases even deny that it's happening, and how horrifying that is, but at the same time preposterously funny.[12]\n\nAfter Vice was released, David Sirota asked Adam McKay to use his \"superpowers of humor and writing\" to create a climate change movie that would be different from the Mad Max-type post-apocalyptic films that had previously been released.[13] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, McKay described how he and Sirota came up with the premise of Don't Look Up while discussing the existential threat of climate change and their frustration over the lack of media coverage it was receiving:\n\nI started talking to a lot of [climate] scientists. I kept looking for good news, and I never got it. Everything I was hearing was worse than what I was hearing on the mainstream media. So I was talking to [David Sirota], and we were both just like, \"can you believe that this isn't being covered in the media? That it's being pushed to the end of the story? That there's no headlines?\" And Sirota just offhandedly said, \"it's like a comet is heading to Earth and it's going to destroy us all and no one cares.\" And I was like, \"that's the idea!\"[14]\n\nMcKay has described the film as a \"blend of broad comedy\" with elements of disaster films and horror films.[15]\n\nAstronomer Amy Mainzer, principal investigator of NASA's NEOWISE mission that tracks near-Earth objects, served as an \"astrotech adviser\" for the film. She provided scientific advice and supported with writing scenes from an early stage of production.[16][17]\n\nOn November 8, 2019, it was announced that Paramount Pictures would distribute the film, with Adam McKay writing, directing, and producing under his Hyperobject Industries banner.[18] On February 19, 2020, Netflix acquired the film from Paramount and Jennifer Lawrence was cast in the film.[19] On May 12, 2020, it was announced that Cate Blanchett had joined the film.[20] In September 2020, Rob Morgan joined the cast.[21] In October 2020, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Himesh Patel, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi (Scott Mescudi), and Tomer Sisley were added.[22][23] McKay wrote the part of Dibiasky specifically for Lawrence, and spent four to five months going over ideas with DiCaprio, tweaking the script before the actor ultimately signed on.[24] In November 2020, Tyler Perry, Melanie Lynskey, and Ron Perlman joined the cast.[25] Mark Rylance and Michael Chiklis were revealed as part of the cast in February 2021.[26] Paul Guilfoyle was announced in May.[27] Matthew Perry was also cast and had scenes filmed with Hill that were ultimately cut from the final film due to health issues.[28] Gina Gershon also filmed a scene with DiCaprio and Blanchett that was cut from the film.[29] Leonardo DiCaprio received top billing on the film's posters and the trailers while Jennifer Lawrence was accorded top billing at the beginning of the film itself. This was also the case with earlier productions The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with James Stewart and John Wayne and All the President's Men (1976) with Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nPrincipal photography was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[30] Filming commenced on November 18, 2020, at various locations in Boston, Massachusetts.[31] Part of the film takes place in New York City with Boston standing in as New York. Filming also took place in other Massachusetts cities including Brockton, Framingham, and Westborough.[a][32][33] On February 5, 2021, Jennifer Lawrence was mildly injured during filming when a controlled glass explosion went awry.[34] Filming wrapped on February 18, 2021.[35]\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nOn December 6, 2023, Adam McKay, along with Netflix, was sued for copyright infringement over Don't Look Up. William Collier, an author from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, claimed that he is the original writer of the story, set in Baton Rouge, called \"Stanley's Comet\", which he self-published in 2012. Collier's daughter worked for Jimmer Miller Entertainment, part of McKay's management team until 2015. Collier alleges that his daughter submitted the text to Mosaic Media Group and it was then received by McKay's manager. \"Since Stanley’s Comet was received by McKay’s manager, custom and practice in the entertainment industry dictates that this constitutes receipt by McKay,\" writes Steven Lowe, a lawyer for Collier, in the suit. \"Furthermore, upon information and belief, the Novel was transmitted via courier, email or hand-delivery (or via other means) to McKay himself.\"[36]\n\n\"The movie, like the novel, makes a strong political critique of the media, the government, and the cultural elite by showcasing their shallowness and reliance on popular opinion polls and social media algorithms,\" writes USC professor of comparative literature David Roman. \"McKay’s film is also full of satire and humor and — like Stanley’s Comet — moves toward the absurd. In each case, the irony drives the humor and the social critique and does so in the same style and method.\"[36]\n\n### Music\n\nTo promote the film, on December 3, 2021, Ariana Grande and Kid Cudi released the single \"Just Look Up\", which is also performed in the film.[37] The original score for the film is composed by Nicholas Britell, who previously scored McKay's The Big Short (2015), Vice (2018) and the HBO television series Succession (2019–2022); McKay served as an executive producer of the latter. He used a wide range of instrumentation that reflect varied music styles and genres.[38][39] He did this so as to give a remainder on the existential crisis on the planet following a catastrophic event as well as the absurdity of how people react to it.[40] Apart from \"Just Look Up\", the film also featured \"Second Nature\" by Bon Iver, which was released along with Britell's score album on December 10, by Republic Records, and \"Doorman\" by Slowthai.[41]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office and VoD\n\nOn February 19, 2020, it was announced that Netflix planned to release the film in 2020.[19] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, filming and release of the film were delayed.[42] The film premiered in New York City on December 5, 2021.[43] It received a limited theatrical release on December 10, and began streaming on Netflix on December 24.[44][45] The film made an estimated $260,000 from 500 theaters on its first day, and a total of $700,000 in its opening weekend.[46]\n\nDon't Look Up was the most-streamed English-language film on Netflix during its first week of release with a viewership of 111.03 million hours,[47] the second highest viewership for a movie during its debut weekend on Netflix.[48] It was the second most-streamed-film of the week in the United States according to TV Time.[49] Per Nielsen, the film had a viewership of 1.6 billion minutes in the United States.[50] In the second week, it retained its first position with a viewership of 152.29 million hours,[51] which also set the record for highest weekly viewership for any film ever on Netflix.[52][53]\n\nFor its first 28 days, the film culminated a viewership of 359.8 million hours, making it the second most-watched film within 28 days of release on Netflix during this period of time.[54] By March 20, the film had been streamed in 10.3 million households in the United States according to Samba TV, including 641,000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8.[55]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 55% of 305 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Don't Look Up aims too high for its scattershot barbs to consistently land, but Adam McKay's star-studded satire hits its target of collective denial square on.\"[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[57]\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle praised the film, \"Don't Look Up might be the funniest movie of 2021. It's the most depressing too, and that odd combination makes for a one-of-a-kind experience. ... McKay gives you over two hours of laughs while convincing you that the world is coming to an end.\"[58] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said: \"From Streep and DiCaprio and Lawrence through the supporting players, Don't Look Up is filled with greatly talented actors really and truly selling this material—but the volume remains at 11 throughout the story when some changes in tone here and there might have more effectively carried the day.\"[59] In the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang wrote, \"Nothing about the foolishness and outrageousness of what the movie shows us—no matter how virtuosically sliced and diced by McKay's characteristically jittery editor, Hank Corwin—can really compete with the horrors of our real-world American idiocracy.\"[60] Amit Katwala of Wired concluded that \"Don't Look Up nails the frustration of being a scientist.\"[61] Linda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: \"There is something genuinely endearing about a film that doesn't seem to care one bit about coming across as silly as long as its message is heard\".[62]\n\nIn a negative review, David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"A cynical, insufferably smug satire stuffed to the gills with stars that purports to comment on political and media inattention to the climate crisis but really just trivializes it. Dr. Strangelove it ain't.\"[63] Peter Debruge of Variety called it a \"smug, easy-target political satire\" and wrote, \"Don't Look Up plays like the leftie answer to Armageddon—which is to say, it ditches the Bruckheimer approach of assembling a bunch of blue-collar heroes to rocket out to space and nuke the approaching comet, opting instead to spotlight the apathy, incompetence and financial self-interest of all involved.\"[64] In The Guardian, Charles Bramesco wrote that the \"script states the obvious as if everyone else is too stupid to realize it and does so from a position of lofty superiority that would drive away any partisans who still need to be won over.\"[65] In The Sociological Review, Katherine Cross accused the film of \"smug condescension\" and wrote it \"is designed to flatter a certain type of liberal viewer into feeling like they're the last sane person in the world, surrounded by morons.\"[66]\n\nReviews from right-wing publications were nearly unanimously negative. Madeline Fry Schultz of the American conservative publication Washington Examiner wrote \"McKay manages to deliver nothing more than a derivative and meandering 'satire' of capitalism, Donald Trump, and climate deniers that will be forgotten in less than six months.\"[67] Kyle Smith of the National Review wrote it \"expends 140 brain-injuriously unfunny minutes... propelling low-velocity spitballs at social media, Washington, tech moguls, Trumpism, and (this detail feels thrown in last minute) anti-vaxxers.\"[68]\n\nNathan J. Robinson, editor of American progressive publication Current Affairs, believes that \"critics were not only missing the point of the film in important ways, but that the very way they discussed the film exemplified the problem that the film was trying to draw attention to. Some of the responses to the movie could have appeared in the movie itself.\"[69] Slavoj Žižek, writing in Compact, said \"critics were displeased by the light tone of Don't Look Up!, claiming it trivializes the ultimate apocalypse. What really bothered these critics is the exact opposite: The film highlights trivialization that permeates not only the establishment, but even the protesters.\"[70] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett viewed the film as astute and was caustic about the critical reviews.[71] Journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot wrote that \"no wonder journalists have slated it ... it's about them\" and added that for environmental activists like himself, the film, while fast‑paced and humorous, \"seemed all too real\".[72] Author and activist Naomi Klein mentions it in her 2023 book Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World by saying that \"Kate's plight perfectly mirrors the bizarre contradictions of our high-stakes moment in planetary history: we are all trapped inside economic and social structures that encourage us to obsessively perfect our miniscule selves even as we know, if only on a subconscious level, that we are in the very last years when it might still be possible to avert an existential planetary crisis.\"[73]\n\nBong Joon-ho, director of Parasite, included Don't Look Up as one of his favorites of 2021.[74]\n\n### Reception amongst scientists\n\nSince the film's release, numerous climate scientists and climate communicators have offered positive opinions on the film.[75][76][77]\n\nIn an opinion piece published in The Guardian, climate scientist Peter Kalmus remarked, \"Don't Look Up is satire. But speaking as a climate scientist doing everything I can to wake people up and avoid planetary destruction, it's also the most accurate film about society's terrifying non-response to climate breakdown I've seen.\"[78] Climate scientist Michael E. Mann also expressed support for the film, calling it \"serious sociopolitical commentary posing as comedy\".[79] In an article for Scientific American, Rebecca Oppenheimer questioned the film's use of a comet impact as an effective metaphor for climate change, given the large differences in timescale of these differing potential extinction crisis events and the nature of their impacts, but praised its depiction of science denialism and depiction of a botched attempt to address a \"planet-killer\" comet.[16] Climate policy expert Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and McKay wrote a joint op-ed in The Guardian advocating for the value of humour in promoting action on climate change, in contrast with other media coverage.[80]\n\nWriting in Physics World, Laura Hiscott said that this \"genuinely funny and entertaining film\" would appeal to scientists, who would appreciate the \"nods to academia such as the importance of peer review, the 'publish or perish' problem and the issue of senior academics getting the credit for their PhD students' discoveries\".[81]\n\nOne of the scenes in the film was compared on social media to a situation in Brazil. In that situation, microbiologist and science communicator Natália Pasternak Taschner criticized a news report made by TV Cultura on a live broadcast in December 2020. They told the Brazilian population to face the COVID-19 pandemic with \"lightness\", minimizing the risks. They also put pressure on the public to be content and uncritical of the Jair Bolsonaro administration's lack of effective response to the pandemic.[82] Hearing about the comparisons, Pasternak thanked McKay, DiCaprio and Lawrence on Twitter, with the video subtitled in English, for the \"incredible\" film.[83]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                               | Date

communication is at the forefront of the film, as it revolves around Mindy and Dibiasky, two scientists, struggling to share the news of their discovery with politicians, talk show hosts, and civilians who are ignorant about the scientific facts of humanity's impending destruction by Comet Dibiasky. Many academic scholars of media and communication have written commentaries that analyze and critique the portrayal of science communication in the film.[citation needed]\n\n### U.S. centrism\n\nIn the Journal of Science Communication, Niels G. Mede writes \"the film depicts sharp partisan divides, strong affective polarization, high distrust toward science within certain social milieus, and pronounced news media sensationalism, which have been found to be characteristic of the United States but not, or to a lesser extent, of several countries other than the US.\"[143] From the same journal, writer Julie Doyle remarked that, \"yet, as the film critiques existing structures and systems it does not imagine an alternative set of realities, nor explain the comet's cause. In focusing upon the fictional stories of scientists, politicians, and media celebrities, the film fails to center any marginalized voices, continuing to privilege global north perspectives, even as these are satirised.\"[144] Doyle comments that \"climate communication needs to keep in place both climate mitigation and adaptation, making the historical and structural inequalities of capitalism and colonialism the interconnected stories of both.\"[144]\n\n### Media training for scientists\n\nOne solution to Mindy and Dibiasky's failed attempts to communicate the severity of the impending comet is undergoing media training, which was brought up in the film multiple times, such as at the conference room at the New York Herald where the Chief Editor proposes media training to Mindy before the show. The concept of media training can come in different forms. Samer Angelone, in a commentary journal on science communication, writes, \"The style that scientists use to communicate science to peer scientists is mostly objective, complex, and full of technical jargon, which is difficult for the general public to connect to—even if it is in the same language.\"[145] Another way to mitigate science skepticism is through storytelling. Mede writes, \"The film also illustrates that storytelling can be a promising strategy to mitigate these reservations ... showing how Mindy is advised before a TV interview that he is 'just telling a story' and must 'keep it simple.'\"[143]\n\n### Gendered emotions in scientific communication\n\nGendered discourse on emotions and mental health make its way into the film through the portrayal of the public's reaction to Mindy and Dibiasky's various media appearances. The scientists share their discovery on a morning talk show, The Daily Rip, in which Dibiasky has an emotional outburst over the show hosts' persistent attempts to sugarcoat the devastating news of the doomsday comet. Professor of media and communication Julie Doyle writes, \"Gendered norms affect Mindy and Dibiasky's public credibility and the mitigatory comet actions they promote. Following his own emotional outburst on TV, Mindy is subsequently recuperated through processes of celebritisation ... hailed as a 'sexy' scientist offering rational and calm advice to the viewers; becoming chief science advisor to the White House to monitor the drone activities of tech billionaire Peter Isherwell; and embarking on a sexual affair with Evantee. In contrast, Dibiasky is discredited and side-lined from rational public commentary through (climate) memes.\"[144]\n\n### Easter eggs\n\nThroughout the film, many historic figures from science and politics can be spotted, adding to the film's nuanced discussion about the relationship between science and politics.\n\nThe opening scene of the film features a figure of Carl Sagan on Dibiasky's desk. In a journal commentary for Science Communication, Samer Angelone writes that \"Sagan was an astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, and astrobiologist but, above all, he was an upholder of scientific credibility and communication.\"[145] Sagan advocated for the urgency to battle climate change, and many viewers see the film as an allegory for him, but his image is juxtaposed by a painting of George W. Bush, \"who later tried to downplay this urgency.\"[143] The film also \"references the affinity of anti-science resentment and populism, showing how President Orlean and her team slander Mindy and Dibiasky using populist rhetoric ... and gather in an Oval Office that has a portrait of the anti-establishment science skeptic Andrew Jackson.\"[143]\n\nThe film ends with a scene that reflects the Last Supper. Dr. Mindy, his family, Kate, Yule, and Teddy all sit around a dinner table and engage in a hand-held prayer, spoken by Yule. After the prayer, Kate Dibiasky gives Yule a kiss, and moments later Comet Dibiasky destroys Earth.[146]\n\n## See also\n\n- Double Asteroid Redirection Test – a real NASA mission to test deflection of an asteroid in 2022\n- Climate change in popular culture\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Additional filming locations include Canton, Chicopee, Fall River, Norton, Salisbury, Weymouth, and Worcester.\n- ^ a b c d Nominees: Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Nicholas Britell, and Taura Stinson\n- ^ Nominees: Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ariana Grande, Jonah Hill, Jennifer Lawrence, Melanie Lynskey, Kid Cudi, Rob Morgan, Himesh Patel, Ron Perlman, Tyler Perry, Mark Rylance, and Meryl Streep\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"Don't Look Up\".

While the first film wasn't bad per se and perfectly watchable, it was very basic and clearly limited in scope and budget. Still alright overall.\n\nThankfully, with a sequel greenlit it feels like this time the writers and director could do much more. The CGI game characters get more of the spotlight than the Human characters, the jokes land better and there's just much more going on here that fans will recognise from the games. With Tails and Knuckles added into the roster, it adds more character dynamic and banter that fleshes them out more in the story.\n\nRobotnik also gets to shine more too thanks to Jim Carrey's performance and having more gadgets and locations to juggle with. The weakest parts of the movie are when Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik aren't on screen, but the scenes are still perfectly watchable and better than almost everything in the first film. There's more locations too and gimmicks to play around with in the movie as well.\n\nWithout spoilers, fans will be most happy with Sonic 2 and even people who aren't a fan of Sonic will still get a kick out of it. Although this ain't saying much, I can confidently say this is the best Video Game Movie I've seen easily. It really felt like they put their soul and effort into it and kids will have a blast with this. Don't forget to stay to the end for a surprise. There will definitely be a third film coming.\n\n7.5/10.\n\n- AdrenalinDragon\n- Mar 31, 2022\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is Sonic the Hedgehog 2?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - March 31, 2022 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Japan\n    - United Kingdom\n- Official site\n    - Sonic Movie Discord Server\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Russian\n    - French\n    - Latin\n    - Hawaiian\n    - Greek\n- Also known as\n    - Sonic 2: La película\n- Filming locations\n    - Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada\n- Production companies\n    - Paramount Pictures\n    - Sega Sammy Group\n    - Original Film\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $110,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $190,872,904\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $72,105,176\n    - Apr 10, 2022\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $405,421,518\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 2 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - Auro 11.1\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n    - 12-Track Digital Sound\n    - DTS:X\n    - D-Cinema 96kHz Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.\n\nThe film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.\n\nThis is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.\n\n- ossie85\n- May 2, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ22\n\n- How long is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3?Powered by Alexa\n- Why is Gamora still alive in this film when her 'alternate self' should no longer exist with the death of Thanos and her present self sacrificed herself to ensure that.

The film is directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, based on a script by Ed Solomon, that adapts the Aircel Comics series The Men in Black by Lowell Cunningham. In the film, Agent K (Jones) and Agent J (Smith) investigate a series of seemingly unrelated criminal incidents related to the extraterrestrials who live in secret on Earth. Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Rip Torn also appear in supporting roles.\n\nDevelopment for the film began in 1992, after producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald optioned the rights to the comic book series. Solomon was soon hired to write the screenplay; Sonnenfeld was the preferred directorial choice, which resulted in delays due to his commitments to other film projects and a failure to secure any alternative directors. Principal photography began in March 1996 and lasted until that June, with filming primarily taking place in New York City. The film's visual effects were helmed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The film's soundtrack contains the theme song of the same name, performed by Smith, as well as the score, composed by Danny Elfman.\n\nMen in Black premiered at Pacific's Cinerama Dome in Hollywood on June 25, 1997, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2. It received critical acclaim for its screenplay, humour, action sequences, and the performances and chemistry between Jones and Smith. The film was a box-office success, grossing more than $589.4 million worldwide and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1997 as well as the ninth-highest-grossing film of the decade. It won for Best Makeup and was also nominated for Best Art Direction and Best Original Score at the 70th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. A sequel was released in 2002, a third film was released in 2012, and a stand-alone spin-off was released in 2019, with Jones and Smith absent.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1961, the Men in Black (MiB) organization is founded after secretly making first contact with extraterrestrials. Ever since, they established Earth as a politically neutral zone for alien refugees who live in secret among humanity, monitor and police their actions, and utilize memory-erasing neuralyzer devices to maintain secrecy.\n\nIn 1997, MiB Agents K and D interrupt a border patrol sting at the Mexico–United States border to apprehend Mikey, a disguised extraterrestrial. When he tries to attack one of the patrol officers, K shoots him and neuralyzes the officers. Feeling that he is too old to continue working and wishing to retire, D asks K to neuralyze him, who reluctantly complies.\n\nSometime later, NYPD plain clothes officer James Darrell Edwards III catches an unnaturally agile criminal, who later commits suicide. While being reprimanded by his superiors, James is visited by K, who scouts him as a potential MiB recruit. Once he passes the MiB's tests, James becomes Agent J while the MiB erases him from government records.\n\nMeanwhile, an alien \"Bug\" crash-lands in upstate New York, kills a farmer named Edgar, and wears his skin as a disguise. Tipped off by tabloid reporting, the agents interview the farmer's wife while the Bug fatally wounds two disguised aliens, who are presumed dead and sent to a city morgue overseen by coroner Laurel Weaver. While investigating the Bug's activities, K and J reach the morgue, where one of the aliens tells J and Laurel that \"the galaxy is on Orion's belt\" before dying. After neuralyzing Laurel, K identifies the alien as Rosenberg, an Arquillian prince, before taking J to question an informant named Frank. Frank reveals that Rosenberg was on Earth protecting a miniature galaxy, a precious source of subatomic energy, and that the Bug wants to use it to destroy the Arquillians. Concurrently, the MiB learns an Arquillian warship has entered Earth's orbit, demanding the galaxy.\n\nJ and the Bug separately deduce the galaxy is attached to the collar of Rosenberg's cat, Orion, which fell into Laurel's care. The Bug reaches Laurel first, swallows the galaxy, and kidnaps her. As the Arquillians threaten to destroy Earth to prevent the Bug from escaping with the galaxy, the MiB lock down all transport routes while J realizes the Bug is heading for the New York State Pavilion, which the MiB used to hide two flying saucers in 1964. As Laurel escapes the Bug's custody, he attempts to leave Earth, but K and J shoot him down. Incensed, the Bug reveals its true form and swallows the agents' weapons. After K provokes it into eating him too, J antagonizes it long enough for K to find his gun and blow the Bug in half from the inside, recovering the galaxy. The Bug tries to attack the agents, but Laurel finds J's gun and kills it.\n\nAfter returning the galaxy to the Arquillians, K confesses he was training J to succeed him so he can retire. The pair bid each other farewell before J neuralyzes K. Sometime later, K reunites with his wife while J is joined by Laurel, now Agent L.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(top) in 2005, and  in 2019\n\n- Tommy Lee Jones as Kevin Brown / Agent K: J's grizzled and humorless mentor. The studio wanted Clint Eastwood for the part, while Jones only accepted the role after Steven Spielberg promised the script would improve, based on his respect for Spielberg's track record. He had been disappointed with the first draft, which he reportedly said \"stank\", feeling it did not capture the tone of the comic.[3][4][5]\n- Will Smith as James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J: A former NYPD detective, newly recruited to the MIB. Smith was cast because Barry Sonnenfeld's wife was a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in Six Degrees of Separation.[3] The studio and Spielberg preferred Chris O'Donnell for the role, fresh off his portrayal of Dick Grayson, whom he played in Batman Forever and Batman &amp;amp; Robin, and Spielberg told Sonnenfeld to take him to dinner to convince him to do it. However, Sonnenfeld got him to not accept the role by saying that he was not a good director and that the script was one O'Donnell should skip.[5][6][7] David Schwimmer also turned down the part, a decision he later regretted when reflecting in 2024.[3][8][9] Like Jones, Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer.\n- Linda Fiorentino as Dr. Laurel Weaver / Agent L: A deputy medical examiner, and later J's partner.\n- Vincent D'Onofrio as Edgar / The Bug: An abusive farmer who is killed and eaten by a giant alien insect, which then wears his skin in order to search for the Galaxy and incite a war from the Arquillians. John Turturro and Bruce Campbell were both offered the role, but they turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.[3]\n- Rip Torn as Chief Zed: The head of the MIB.\n- Tony Shalhoub as Jack Jeebs: An alien arms dealer who runs a pawn shop as a front.\n- Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Beatrice: Edgar's abused wife.\n- Mike Nussbaum as Gentle Rosenberg: An Arquillian royal family member, posing as a jeweler, who is the guardian of \"the Galaxy\".\n- Jon Gries as Nick the van driver: the American smuggler who unknowingly carries a literal alien among his posse.\n- Sergio Calderón as Jose\n- John Alexander as Mikey: An alien who poses as a Mexican being smuggled across the border.\n- Patrick Breen as Mr. Redgick\n- Becky Ann Baker as Mrs. Redgick\n- Carel Struycken as Arquillian\n- Fredric Lehne as Agent Janus\n- Kent Faulcon as 2nd Lieutenant Jake Jensen\n- Richard Hamilton as Agent D: K's former partner who retires after deciding he is too old for the job.\n- Ken Thorley as Zap-Em Man, an Exterminator who is killed by Edgar the Bug\n- David Cross as Newton, Morgue Attendant\n- Sean Whalen as Passport Officer\n- Verne Troyer as the Alien son\n- Harsh Nayyar as News Vendor\n- Bernard Gilkey as himself (New York Mets outfielder)\n\n### Voices/Puppeteers\n\n- Tim Blaney as Frank the Pug: A smart-talking pug-like alien.\n- Mark Setrakian as Rosenberg Alien\n- Brad Abrell, Thom Fountain, Carl J. Johnson, and Drew Massey as the Worm Guys: A quartet of worm-like aliens that work for Men in Black.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nThe film is loosely based on Lowell Cunningham and Sandy Carruthers's comic book The Men in Black. Producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald optioned the rights to The Men in Black in 1992, and hired Ed Solomon to write a very faithful script. Parkes and MacDonald wanted Barry Sonnenfeld as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values. However, Sonnenfeld was attached to Get Shorty (1995), so they instead approached Les Mayfield (best known for his remake of Miracle on 34th Street). Mayfield was briefly attached before it fell through. John Landis and Quentin Tarantino were asked to direct but each declined.[10] As a result, Men in Black was delayed, allowing Sonnenfeld to make it his next project after Get Shorty.[3] David Schwimmer was offered the role of Agent J but he declined due to scheduling conflicts.[11]\n\nMuch of the initial script drafts were set underground, with locations ranging from Kansas to Washington, D.C., and Nevada. Sonnenfeld decided to change the location to New York City, because Sonnenfeld felt New Yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised, terming the movie as \"The French Connection with aliens\". He also felt much of the city's structures resembled flying saucers and rocket ships.[3] One of the locations Sonnenfeld thought perfect for the movie was a giant ventilation structure for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, which became the outside of the MIB headquarters.[12]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel ventilation building in New York, which was used as the setting for MIB headquarters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 1996. Many last-minute changes ensued during production. First, the scene where James Edwards was chasing a disguised alien was to be filmed at Lincoln Center, but the New York Philharmonic decided to charge the filmmakers for using their buildings, prompting Sonnenfeld to film the scene at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum instead. Then, five months into the shoot, Sonnenfeld decided that the original ending, with a humorous existential debate between Agent J and the Bug, was unexciting and lacking the action that the rest of the film had.[12] Five potential replacements were discussed. One of these had Laurel Weaver being neuralyzed and K remaining an agent.[3] Eventually it boiled down to the Bug eating K and fighting J, replacing the animatronic Bug Rick Baker's crew had developed with a computer-generated Bug with an appearance closer to a cockroach. The whole action sequence cost an extra $4.5 million to the filmmakers.[12]\n\nFurther changes were made during post-production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy. The Arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the Baltians, ending a long war. The Bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war. Through changing of subtitles, the images on M.I.B.'s main computer and Frank the Pug's dialogue, the Baltians were eliminated from the plot. Earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the Arquillians themselves to prevent the Bugs from getting the galaxy.[3] These changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film's post-production, but the film's novelization still contains the Baltians.[13]\n\n### Design and visual effects\n\nProduction designer Bo Welch designed the MIB headquarters with a 1960s tone in mind, because that was when their organization was formed. He cited influences from Finnish architect Eero Saarinen, who designed a terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. As the arrival point of aliens on Earth, Welch felt the headquarters had to resemble an airport.[3]\n\nRick Baker was approached to provide the prosthetic and animatronic aliens, many of whom would have more otherworldly designs instead of looking humanoid. For example, the reveal of Gentle Rosenberg's Arquillian nature went from a man with a light under his neck's skin to a small alien hidden inside a human head. Baker would describe Men in Black as the most complex production in his career, \"requiring more sketches than all my previous movies together\".[12][14][15] Baker had to have approval from both Sonnenfeld and Spielberg: \"It was like, 'Steven likes the head on this one and Barry really likes the body on this one, so why don't you do a mix and match?' And I'd say, because it wouldn't make any sense.\" Sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film's aesthetic during pre-production: \"I started out saying aliens shouldn't be what humans perceive them to be. Why do they need eyes? So Rick did these great designs, and I'd say, 'That's great — but how do we know where he's looking?' I ended up where everyone else did, only I took three months.\"[16] The maquettes built by Baker's team were later digitized by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, which was responsible for the visual effects and computer-generated imagery, for more mobile digital versions of the aliens.[12]\n\n## Music\n\nTwo different soundtracks for the film were released: a score soundtrack featuring music composed by Danny Elfman and an album of songs used in and inspired by the film, featuring Will Smith's original song \"Men in Black\" based on the film's plot.\n\nElfman's music was called \"rousing\" by the Los Angeles Times.[17] Variety called the film a technical marvel, giving special credit to \"Elfman's always lively score.\"[18] Elfman was nominated for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score at the 70th Academy Awards for his score, but lost to The Full Monty.[19]\n\nElfman recalled in 2017 how he was chosen to compose the soundtrack as \"strange.\" He was on the set of The Frighteners with Peter Jackson when D'Onofrio, who was shooting Men In Black on the other set, walked in and invited both men to watch him perform the final scene. Then on the way home, Elfman got a call from his agent saying that he was hired to compose the soundtrack, even though there was no discussion about it prior.[20]\n\nElvis Presley's song \"Promised Land\" is featured in the scene where the MIB's car runs on the ceiling of Queens–Midtown Tunnel.[21]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nIn advance of the film's theatrical release, its marketing campaign included more than 30 licensees.[22] Galoob was the first to license, in which they released various action figures of the film's characters and aliens.[23] Ray-Ban also partnered the film with a $5–10 million television campaign.[24] Other promotional items included Hamilton Watches[25] and Procter &amp; Gamble's Head &amp; Shoulders with the tagline \"Keeping the Men in Black in black\".[26]\n\nAn official comic adaptation was released by Marvel Comics. The film also received a third-person shooter Men in Black game developed by Gigawatt Studios and published by Gremlin Interactive, which was released to lackluster reviews in October 1997 for the PC and the following year for the PlayStation. Also, a very rare promotional PlayStation video game system was released in 1997 with the Men in Black logo on the CD lid. Three months after the film's release, an animated series based on Men in Black, produced by Columbia TriStar Television alongside Adelaide Productions and Amblin Television, began airing on The WB's Kids' WB programming block, and also inspired several games. A Men in Black role-playing game was also released in 1997 by West End Games.\n\n### Home media\n\nMen in Black was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 25, 1997 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The home video release was attached to a rebate offer on a pair of Ray-Ban Predator-model sunglasses.[27] The film was re-released in a collector's series on VHS and DVD on September 5, 2000,[28] with the DVD containing several bonus features including an interactive editing workshop for three different scenes from the film, extended storyboards, conceptual art, and a visual commentary track with Tommy Lee Jones and director Barry Sonnenfeld; an alternate two-disc Deluxe Edition was released in 2002, adding a fullscreen version and a preview for Men In Black II.[29] A Blu-ray edition was released on June 17, 2008.[30] The entire Men in Black trilogy was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 5, 2017, in conjunction with the film's 20th anniversary.[31]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nMen in Black earned $4.8 million from Tuesday night previews and went on to gross $14 million on its opening day, bringing the total gross to $18.8 million.[32] During its opening weekend, it generated $51.1 million, making it the third-highest opening weekend of all time, behind Batman Forever and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. The film then grossed $84.1 million during its five-day Wednesday opening. It surpassed Independence Day for having three records. These were the biggest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend, the largest July opening weekend and the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel film.[33] The film would hold the latter two records for three years until 2000 when X-Men took them.[34][35] Two years later, its successor Men in Black II broke the record for having the highest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend.[36] Moreover, Men in Black held the record for having the highest opening weekend for an action-packed comedy film until Rush Hour 2 surpassed it in 2001.[37] It would remain in the number one spot at the box office for three weeks until it was beaten by Air Force One.[38][39] The film also competed against Hercules and Batman &amp; Robin during its theatrical run.[40]\n\nMen in Black grossed $250.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $338.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $589.3 million.[1] It would hold the record for being Sony's highest-grossing film until it was surpassed by Spider-Man five years later in 2002.[41][42] The film grossed a record $10.7 million in its opening weekend in Germany, beating the record held by Independence Day.[43]\n\nDespite its grosses, writer Ed Solomon has said that Sony claims the film has never turned a profit, which is attributed to Hollywood accounting.[44]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Men in Black holds an approval rating of 91% based on 93 reviews, and an average score of 7.50/10. The site's critical consensus reads \"Thanks to a smart script, spectacular set pieces, and charismatic performances from its leads, Men in Black is an entirely satisfying summer blockbuster hit.\"[45] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[46] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[47]\n\nGene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praising the film as \"a smart, funny and hip adventure film in a summer of car wrecks and explosions.\"[48] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, giving particular praise to the film's self-reflective humor and Rick Baker's alien creature designs.[49] Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, wrote the film \"is actually a shade more deadpan and peculiar than such across-the-board marketing makes it sound. It's also extraordinarily ambitious, with all-star design and special-effects talent and a genuinely artful visual style. As with his Addams Family films and Get Shorty, which were more overtly funny than the sneakily subtle Men in Black, Mr. Sonnenfeld takes offbeat genre material and makes it boldly mainstream.\"[50]\n\nWriting for Variety, Todd McCarthy acknowledged the film was \"witty and sometimes surreal sci-fi comedy\" in which he praised the visual effects, Baker's creature designs and Elfman's musical score. However, he felt the film \"doesn't manage to sustain this level of inventiveness, delight and surprise throughout the remaining two-thirds of the picture.\"[51] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a C+, writing \"Men in Black celebrates the triumph of attitude over everything else – plausibility, passion, any sense that what we're watching actually matters. The aliens, for all their slimy visual zest, aren't particularly scary or funny (they aren't allowed to become characters), and so the joke of watching Smith and Jones crack wise in their faces quickly wears thin.\"[52]\n\nJohn Hartl of The Seattle Times, claimed the film \"is moderately amusing, well-constructed and mercifully short, but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half.\" While he was complimentary of the film's first half, he concluded \"somewhere around the midpoint they run out of energy and invention. Even the aliens, once they stop their shape-shifting ways and settle down to appear as themselves, begin to look familiar.\"[53]\n\n### Accolades\n\nMen in Black won Best Makeup at the 70th Academy Awards and was also nominated for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score and Best Art Direction, losing the latter two to The Full Monty and Titanic, respectively.[54] The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 55th Golden Globe Awards, losing to As Good as It Gets.[55]\n\n| Award                            | Category                                      | Recipient                                               | Result    |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards                   | Best Art Direction                            | Art Direction: Bo Welch;

The film was the first time 'Men in Black\" appeared in a major movie, cementing the men in black in popular culture.[60]\nThe film 'poked fun' at government debunking, with one of the Men in Black telling a witness \"The flash of light you saw was not a UFO, swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from Venus\" -- a combination of 'official explanations' the Air Force has offered for UFO reports.[61]\n\n## See also\n\n- Film portal\n- United States portal\n- 1990s portal\n- Science fiction portal\n\n- List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Men in Black (1997)\".

It is the sixth Wallace &amp; Gromit film, the first since A Matter of Loaf and Death (2008), and the second feature-length film after The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005). It features the return of Feathers McGraw from The Wrong Trousers (1993), who is out for revenge on Wallace and Gromit and turns the former's latest invention on the duo to enable his vengeance.\n\nWallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl premiered at the American Film Institute on 27 October 2024. It was broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer on 25 December in the UK and was released on Netflix internationally on 3 January 2025. After 28 days of catch-up viewing, it became the BBC's most watched scripted show since 2002. The film received critical acclaim, holding a 100% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. It was nominated in the Animated Feature categories at the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Annie Awards and the BAFTAs, winning the latter. It also won the inaugural BAFTA Award for Best Children's &amp; Family Film, in addition to being nominated for Outstanding British Film at the same ceremony.\n\n## Plot\n\nWallace has invented a robotic garden gnome called Norbot and opens a business hiring it out to work in gardens around the vicinity, making Gromit feel left out and concerned about his owner's reliance on technology. Annoyed at Norbot's loud recharging at night, Gromit uses a computer in their house's basement where it can be done instead.\n\nWhen criminal penguin Feathers McGraw hears about Norbot on television, he hacks into the computer and reprograms Norbot to serve him and mass-produce an army of gnomes as part of a plot for revenge against Wallace and Gromit for his previous defeat.[a] While working at homes around the city, the gnomes steal several objects. Chief Inspector Albert Mackintosh and his new recruit, PC Mukherjee, conclude that Wallace is responsible and confiscate most of his inventions, but do not find the gnomes.\n\nGromit reclaims Wallace's tracking device from the police station and tracks the gnomes to the local zoo where Feathers is imprisoned, discovering that they have used their contraband to build a submarine for Feathers to escape in through the sewers. Feathers then spots Gromit and has Norbot cut him from the tree he is hiding in. The duo fall into a nearby enclosure and the impact resets Norbot to his original setting. Gromit goes to the museum, where the Blue Diamond is being put back on display, but it is soon revealed that it was replaced with a turnip; Feathers had hidden the real diamond in his and Wallace's house prior to his arrest. Gromit returns home, but he and Wallace are captured by the gnomes as Feathers recovers the diamond before detaining the duo in a wardrobe.\n\nWallace and Gromit manage to use a leaf blower in order to escape with Norbot. The trio then pursue Feathers down a canal on narrowboats while Mackintosh, unaware of the latter's escape, and Mukherjee, still believing in Wallace's innocence, pursue on a bicycle; one of the narrowboats happens to belong to Mackintosh. After he and Wallace come up with a way to reprogram the gnomes, Gromit jumps aboard Feathers' narrowboat, but when Feathers sees that the police have blocked the canal, he steers off a navigable aqueduct. With the boat teetering over the edge, Wallace persuades Gromit to surrender the diamond to Feathers. Satisfied about his apparent victory, Feathers then jumps off the narrowboat, which falls, but Gromit is rescued by Norbot and his fellow gnomes.\n\nFeathers escapes to Yorkshire on a train, but discovers that Gromit had given him a turnip instead of the diamond. Mackintosh praises Mukherjee for trusting her instincts and retires from the force, passing the torch to her. Wallace returns to inventing, admitting that machinery cannot replace the human touch, and Gromit gains a new respect for Norbot.\n\n## Voice cast\n\n- Ben Whitehead as Wallace, an eccentric inventor and Gromit's owner. Vengeance Most Fowl was Whitehead's first full film performance as Wallace following Peter Sallis' retirement in 2010 and death in 2017. Whitehead has voiced Wallace in video games and commercials since 2008.\n- Peter Kay as Chief Inspector Albert Mackintosh, former police constable having been promoted to chief inspector. Kay reprises his role from Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.[2]\n- Reece Shearsmith as Norbot, Wallace's latest invention designed to do jobs around the house, but whose personality setting is altered by Feathers McGraw[ 3]\n    - Shearsmith also voices Norbot's fellow robotic gnomes, who act as minions for Feathers McGraw.\n- Lauren Patel as PC Mukherjee, Chief Inspector Albert Mackintosh's plucky and young protégée.[4]\n- Diane Morgan as Onya Doorstep, a news reporter for Up North News.[5]\n- Muzz Khan as Anton Deck, a newsreader for Up North News; the character's name is a pun on the television duo, Ant &amp;amp; Dec.[6]\n\nThe Farmer from the Wallace &amp; Gromit spin-off series Shaun the Sheep makes a cameo, voiced by John Sparkes.[citation needed] Adjoa Andoh and Lenny Henry have cameo roles as a judge and Mr. Convenience. TV presenter and radio DJ Roman Kemp also made a brief appearance as part of an angry mob.[citation needed]\n\n## Production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nModels from  on display\n\nDuring production of A Matter of Loaf and Death (2008), Nick Park remarked on difficulties with working with DreamWorks Animation during the production of The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005), such as the constant production notes and demands to alter the material to appeal more to American children.[7][8] This discouraged him from producing another feature film for years, with Peter Lord noting that Park preferred the \"half hour format\",[9] as well as the end of the partnership after the poor box office performance of Flushed Away (2006).\n\nA new Wallace &amp; Gromit film was announced in January 2022, with Park and Merlin Crossingham as directors, from a screenplay by Mark Burton, while Claire Jennings was announced to produce.[10][11] Park conceived the film as another 30-minute short, which expanded into a feature film.[12] The factory that made Lewis Newplast, the modelling clay used by Aardman, shut down in March 2023; Aardman purchased enough remaining clay to cover the new film.[13] The Daily Telegraph reported that the studio may not be able to produce further films, but Aardman released a statement clarifying that it would find a new supplier.[14][15]\n\nThe title was announced on 6 June 2024, alongside the reveal that Feathers McGraw, the villain of The Wrong Trousers (1993), would return. At that time, Richard Beek was announced to have replaced Claire Jennings as the producer, although Jennings would remain credited as a consulting producer.[16]\n\n## Music\n\nThe score was composed by Lorne Balfe and series composer Julian Nott, with the themes composed by Nott. Balfe previously provided additional music for Nott's score in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005).[17] Gromit listens to Eric Coates' By the Sleepy Lagoon before being interrupted by Norbot. \"Born Free\" by Matt Monro is also briefly in the film, played by Feathers McGraw during the escape scene. McGraw at one point plays J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor on the organ mounted in his submarine, a reference to the piece's use in the 1954 movie 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, as played by Captain Nemo.\n\n## Release\n\nVengeance Most Fowl premiered worldwide on the closing day of the AFI Fest on 27 October at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, with a limited theatrical release on 18 December 2024.[18] It aired in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 25 December 2024, and was released worldwide on Netflix on 3 January 2025.[19][20][21][10][11] To promote the film, the BBC also commissioned three Wallace &amp; Gromit-themed idents for BBC One, which were aired through the Christmas season.[22][23] Vengeance Most Fowl was viewed by 9.38 million BBC One viewers on Christmas Day. It was the second-most-watched broadcast in the UK since 2022, after the Gavin &amp; Stacey Christmas special, also broadcast that day.[24] After 28 days of catch up viewing, that figure increased to 21.6 million, becoming the BBC's most-watched scripted show since 2002.[25] Park said Vengeance Most Fowl would not be the final Wallace &amp; Gromit film, and that \"there's always ideas worth kicking about\".[26]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 132 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Comforting as cheese and crackers, with some gentle ribbing of modern technology sprinkled on top, Vengeance Most Fowl revives this lovable pair with all their charm intact.\"[27] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 83 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[28]\n\nWriting in The Guardian, Stuart Heritage called it \"a triumphant return\". He felt the film \"does end up suffering a little, in part because of an extended runtime that renders it less densely packed with jokes and invention than we've become used to. It's also a bit too talky, robbing the pair of the easy international appeal they had when their dialogue was kept spare.\"[29] In the Irish Independent, Vicky Jessop praised the subplot and tone.[30]\n\nDan Norris, Mayor of the West of England, criticised the BBC and Aardman for not including a ‘Made in Bristol’ line to the film's closing credits, as with  other successful global hits like the David Attenborough nature documentaries that are produced in the city.[31]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                         | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                                          | Recipient(s)                                                                      | Result    | Ref.      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards               | 20 November 2024    | Best Original Score – Animated Film                                               | Lorne Balfe &amp; Julian Nott                                                         | Nominated | [32]      |\n| Astra Film Awards                             | 8 December 2024     | Best Animated Feature                                                             | Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl                                             | Nominated | [33]      |\n| Washington D.C.

Annoyed at Norbot's loud recharging at night, Gromit uses a computer in their house's basement where it can be done instead.\n\n        When criminal penguin Feathers McGraw hears about Norbot on television, he hacks into the computer and reprograms Norbot to serve him and mass-produce an army of gnomes as part of a plot for revenge against Wallace and Gromit for his previous defeat. While working at homes around the city, the gnomes steal several objects. Chief Inspector Albert Mackintosh and his new recruit, PC Mukherjee, conclude that Wallace is responsible and confiscate most of his inventions, but do not find the gnomes.\n\n        Gromit reclaims Wallace's tracking device from the police station and tracks the gnomes to the local zoo where Feathers is imprisoned, discovering that they have used their contraband to build a submarine for Feathers to escape in through the sewers. Feathers then spots Gromit and has Norbot cut him from the tree he is hiding in. The duo fall into a nearby enclosure and the impact resets Norbot to his original setting. Gromit goes to the museum, where the Blue Diamond is being put back on display, but it is soon revealed that it was replaced with a turnip; Feathers had hidden the real diamond in his and Wallace's house prior to his arrest. Gromit returns home, but he and Wallace are captured by the gnomes as Feathers recovers the diamond before detaining the duo in a wardrobe.\n\n        Wallace and Gromit manage to use a leaf blower in order to escape with Norbot. The trio then pursue Feathers down a canal on narrowboats while Mackintosh, unaware of the latter's escape, and Mukherjee, still believing in Wallace's innocence, pursue on a bicycle; one of the narrowboats happens to belong to Mackintosh. After he and Wallace come up with a way to reprogram the gnomes, Gromit jumps aboard Feathers' narrowboat, but when Feathers sees that the police have blocked the canal, he steers off a navigable aqueduct. With the boat teetering over the edge, Wallace persuades Gromit to surrender the diamond to Feathers. Satisfied about his apparent victory, Feathers then jumps off the narrowboat, which falls, but Gromit is rescued by Norbot and his fellow gnomes.\n\n        Feathers escapes to Yorkshire on a train, but discovers that Gromit had given him a turnip instead of the diamond. Mackintosh praises Mukherjee for trusting her instincts and retires from the force, passing the torch to her. Wallace returns to inventing, admitting that machinery cannot replace the human touch, and Gromit gains a new respect for Norbot.\n    </Plot>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the relevant information is tagged according to the specified attributes.

Every story exists in an imaginative world, whether a family is sitting down having dinner or two hobbits are climbing a volcano to destroy a ring of power.\n\nWhile a story that takes place in a world like our own does still involve worldbuilding, it tends to be more subtle than, say, inventing Middle Earth and the languages that belong to it. For this article, I’m going to share some amazing examples of worldbuilding…from films that are not adaptations of prior existing IP (but, yeah, obviously J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, and George R.R. Martin, have created exciting worlds with immeasurable amounts of detail).\n\n## A Quiet Place\n\n#### Written by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck, John Krasinski\n\nA Quiet Place began with a great concept: monsters with extremely sensitive hearing attack Earth, forcing humans to adapt in silence if they want to survive.\n\nI love curiosity experiments like this. From walking barefoot — and on paths of sand — to muffling footsteps to creating noise diversions and even the Abbotts’ plan to keep their new infant safe, the post-monster invasion world was rife with details and imagination.\n\n## Edge of Tomorrow\n\n#### Written by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth\n\nKeeping with the monsters-attack-Emily-Blunt theme, Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent action story about Earth’s response to an alien invasion. It begins with the technology humans have devised to respond to the superior threat but then becomes an excellent Groundhog Day-esque story of someone with the ability to reset time and do the day over.\n\nFrom sharing details about the world enmeshed in war to the reveal of the alien’s time travel abilities, this is a clever and gripping example of how to put a unique spin on a familiar concept.\n\nRead More: Do’s and Don’ts of Worldbuilding for Writers\n\n## Inception\n\n#### Written by Christopher Nolan\n\nChristopher Nolan is a genius when it comes to worldbuilding. We could have chosen any number of his films to feature here, from the blight-ravaged earth of Interstellar to his gritty interpretation of Batman, but we’ll focus on Inception because of its layers and layers of worldbuilding and, indeed, a character who designs the worlds within the plot of the film. The dream-sharing ability at the center of Inception is so fundamental to the story that to this day fans debate over what was real in the film and what was designed by architects.\n\nInception also does a great job of explaining how the laws of the world work and portraying them visually on-screen, from the physics to the subconscious mind, and even how to wake someone up. It anticipates questions and reminds audiences subtly of the mechanics of the world so we are guided through the story and the characters’ journeys without distraction. It’s an absolute masterclass in storytelling.\n\n## The Truman Show\n\n#### Written by Andrew Niccol\n\nIn The Truman Show, Jim Carrey plays Truman, a man who grew up thinking he lived an ordinary life but actually lives on an enormous set of a reality show watched by millions around the globe. Screenwriter Andrew Niccol had to create the world of the reality show as well as the real-world tuning in, interweaving the two as Truman’s ignorance dissolves during his quest for the truth.\n\nLittle details like product placement or the behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew operating the show cleverly illustrate the complexity of this world.\n\n## Moonrise Kingdom\n\n#### Written by Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola\n\nWes Anderson’s visual signature is so popular that it has become a trend on social media — from his use of bright color palettes, his love of symmetry, and his character tableaus, his films are visual treats. But that isn’t where his worldbuilding ends. He is the master of eccentric characters, quirky dialogue, and utterly charming plots that manage to suspend disbelief and wholly enthrall audiences.\n\nIn Moonrise Kingdom, a young boy scout and his theatrical and dark pen pal make a pact to run away together, upending the idyllic norm of the island they call home. Anderson’s worldbuilding makes the stakes feel serious, endearing, and satisfying.\n\n## Tron: Legacy\n\n#### Written by Edward Kitsis, Adam Horowitz\n\nTechnically, Tron: Legacy is a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Tron, written by Steven Lisberger. The two serve excellently as examples of worldbuilding because of how time and technology allowed Tron: Legacy to build on its predecessor, making them excellent comparisons.\n\nIn Tron, Jeff Bridges is transported inside the cyberspace of a computer mainframe where human-like programs are forced to compete in deadly games. In Tron: Legacy, Garrett Hedlund plays Bridges’ son, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality run by a malevolent program trying to invade the real world.\n\nThe worldbuilding of both computer programs is fascinating itself — from the visual designs to the “games” the programs and users play, but what is even more intriguing is how the story and motivations of the antagonists evolve from the first film to the second.\n\n## Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\n#### Written by George Lucas\n\nI had to. You know I had to. George Lucas created arguably the most impactful science fiction universe when he created his quirky little space opera about a farmboy teaming up with a wizard and a smuggler to save a princess from an evil empire. What could have been hokey became one of the most beloved franchises of all time. What distinguishes Star Wars from other incredible stories set in the grand infinity of space (Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, Firefly, the list goes on) is the Force, an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together.\n\nIn short, the Force is what gives Jedi Knights — and Sith Lords — their powers of telekinesis, mind control, precognition, and superior reflexes (to name a few). The religion of the Jedi Knights weaves Star Wars stories together; stories that inevitably champion the people fighting for freedom against corrupt governments or institutions.\n\nIn A New Hope alone, Lucas imagined a desert planet rotating around twin suns, a jungle-covered moon, and a space station large enough to destroy an entire planet. He dreamt up sentient droids, Wookies, and the myriad of species in the Mos Eisley Cantina. He introduced the Galactic Empire and the Rebellion resisting it. He developed X-Wings, TIE-fighters, Imperial Star Destroyers, and the Millennium Falcon. He gave us lightsabers.\n\nScience Fiction is, by its very nature, a genre that requires imaginative worldbuilding — but A New Hope is a prime example of how to weave lore with technology with compelling characters who are unforgettable.\n\n## The Sixth Sense\n\n#### Written by M. Night Shyamalan\n\nNow iconic, The Sixth Sense is the story of a child psychologist whose patient claims he can “see dead people.” The psychological thriller follows Bruce Willis’ Malcolm Crowe as he begins working with nine-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who insists he can see and communicate with ghosts.\n\nShyamalan’s worldbuilding is at its finest in this film, from slowly introducing the presence of ghosts through the trauma and injuries of Cole to the revelation that the ghosts may have a reason for visiting the living. Shyamalan’s worldbuilding includes eerie hauntings and subtle use of color that is nearly imperceptible upon first-watch. Altogether he creates suspense and the urge to know what happens next.\n\n## The Nightmare Before Christmas\n\n#### Written by Caroline Thompson, Tim Burton\n\nTim Burton’s animated dark fantasy musical tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of Halloween Town, who stumbles upon Christmas Town and tries to bring the holiday to his home. The story is an open-door invitation for imagination and worldbuilding. Directed by Henry Selick, the film conjures up a world devoted to Halloween year-round that is spooky while still being palatable for kids.\n\nThe visuals of the stop-motion go a long way toward selling this idea, but the worldbuilding behind them is fine-tuned, from the creatures who live in Halloween Town to its hierarchy and structure to the wants and needs of its denizens.\n\nRead More: The Fundamentals of Worldbuilding in Screenwriting\n\n—\n\nThere is simply no limit to the worldbuilding that can be done — but when it is done well, the effects are magnetic and unforgettable. At the heart of every new world or town or galaxy is who lives in it and what they want. The worlds must serve the characters within them.\n\nThe reveals of the worlds must also serve the characters and the story you are telling. Revelations must be earned in order to deliver the most emotional impact for the characters — and the audience. It’s a delicate art, but rewatch films like these and you can see how the storytellers trickled breadcrumbs to lead viewers through the forests of their imagination.\n\nHappy writing!\n\nShannon Corbeil is a writer, actor, and U.S. Air Force veteran in Los Angeles with appearances on SEAL Team and The Rookie.

From walking barefoot — and on paths of sand — to muffling footsteps to creating noise diversions and even the Abbotts’ plan to keep their new infant safe, the post-monster invasion world was rife with details and imagination.\n\n## <Name>Edge of Tomorrow</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth</Director>\n\nKeeping with the monsters-attack-Emily-Blunt theme, <Edge of Tomorrow> is an excellent action story about Earth’s response to an alien invasion. It begins with the technology humans have devised to respond to the superior threat but then becomes an excellent Groundhog Day-esque story of someone with the ability to reset time and do the day over.\n\nFrom sharing details about the world enmeshed in war to the reveal of the alien’s time travel abilities, this is a clever and gripping example of how to put a unique spin on a familiar concept.\n\nRead More: Do’s and Don’ts of Worldbuilding for Writers\n\n## <Name>Inception</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by Christopher Nolan</Director>\n\nChristopher Nolan is a genius when it comes to worldbuilding. We could have chosen any number of his films to feature here, from the blight-ravaged earth of <Interstellar> to his gritty interpretation of <Batman>, but we’ll focus on <Inception> because of its layers and layers of worldbuilding and, indeed, a character who designs the worlds within the plot of the film. The dream-sharing ability at the center of <Inception> is so fundamental to the story that to this day fans debate over what was real in the film and what was designed by architects.\n\n<Inception> also does a great job of explaining how the laws of the world work and portraying them visually on-screen, from the physics to the subconscious mind, and even how to wake someone up. It anticipates questions and reminds audiences subtly of the mechanics of the world so we are guided through the story and the characters’ journeys without distraction. It’s an absolute masterclass in storytelling.\n\n## <Name>The Truman Show</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by Andrew Niccol</Director>\n\nIn <The Truman Show>, Jim Carrey plays Truman, a man who grew up thinking he lived an ordinary life but actually lives on an enormous set of a reality show watched by millions around the globe. Screenwriter Andrew Niccol had to create the world of the reality show as well as the real-world tuning in, interweaving the two as Truman’s ignorance dissolves during his quest for the truth.\n\nLittle details like product placement or the behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew operating the show cleverly illustrate the complexity of this world.\n\n## <Name>Moonrise Kingdom</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola</Director>\n\nWes Anderson’s visual signature is so popular that it has become a trend on social media — from his use of bright color palettes, his love of symmetry, and his character tableaus, his films are visual treats. But that isn’t where his worldbuilding ends. He is the master of eccentric characters, quirky dialogue, and utterly charming plots that manage to suspend disbelief and wholly enthrall audiences.\n\nIn <Moonrise Kingdom>, a young boy scout and his theatrical and dark pen pal make a pact to run away together, upending the idyllic norm of the island they call home. Anderson’s worldbuilding makes the stakes feel serious, endearing, and satisfying.\n\n## <Name>Tron: Legacy</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by Edward Kitsis, Adam Horowitz</Director>\n\nTechnically, <Tron: Legacy> is a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film <Tron>, written by Steven Lisberger. The two serve excellently as examples of worldbuilding because of how time and technology allowed <Tron: Legacy> to build on its predecessor, making them excellent comparisons.\n\nIn <Tron>, Jeff Bridges is transported inside the cyberspace of a computer mainframe where human-like programs are forced to compete in deadly games. In <Tron: Legacy>, Garrett Hedlund plays Bridges’ son, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality run by a malevolent program trying to invade the real world.\n\nThe worldbuilding of both computer programs is fascinating itself — from the visual designs to the “games” the programs and users play, but what is even more intriguing is how the story and motivations of the antagonists evolve from the first film to the second.\n\n## <Name>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by George Lucas</Director>\n\nI had to. You know I had to. George Lucas created arguably the most impactful science fiction universe when he created his quirky little space opera about a farmboy teaming up with a wizard and a smuggler to save a princess from an evil empire. What could have been hokey became one of the most beloved franchises of all time. What distinguishes <Star Wars> from other incredible stories set in the grand infinity of space (Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, Firefly, the list goes on) is the Force, an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together.\n\nIn short, the Force is what gives Jedi Knights — and Sith Lords — their powers of telekinesis, mind control, precognition, and superior reflexes (to name a few). The religion of the Jedi Knights weaves <Star Wars> stories together; stories that inevitably champion the people fighting for freedom against corrupt governments or institutions.\n\nIn <A New Hope> alone, Lucas imagined a desert planet rotating around twin suns, a jungle-covered moon, and a space station large enough to destroy an entire planet. He dreamt up sentient droids, Wookies, and the myriad of species in the Mos Eisley Cantina. He introduced the Galactic Empire and the Rebellion resisting it. He developed X-Wings, TIE-fighters, Imperial Star Destroyers, and the Millennium Falcon. He gave us lightsabers.\n\nScience Fiction is, by its very nature, a genre that requires imaginative worldbuilding — but <A New Hope> is a prime example of how to weave lore with technology with compelling characters who are unforgettable.\n\n## <Name>The Sixth Sense</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by M. Night Shyamalan</Director>\n\nNow iconic, <The Sixth Sense> is the story of a child psychologist whose patient claims he can “see dead people.” The psychological thriller follows Bruce Willis’ Malcolm Crowe as he begins working with nine-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who insists he can see and communicate with ghosts.\n\nShyamalan’s worldbuilding is at its finest in this film, from slowly introducing the presence of ghosts through the trauma and injuries of Cole to the revelation that the ghosts may have a reason for visiting the living. Shyamalan’s worldbuilding includes eerie hauntings and subtle use of color that is nearly imperceptible upon first-watch. Altogether he creates suspense and the urge to know what happens next.\n\n## <Name>The Nightmare Before Christmas</Name>\n\n#### <Director>Written by Caroline Thompson, Tim Burton</Director>\n\nTim Burton’s animated dark fantasy musical tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of Halloween Town, who stumbles upon Christmas Town and tries to bring the holiday to his home. The story is an open-door invitation for imagination and worldbuilding. Directed by Henry Selick, the film conjures up a world devoted to Halloween year-round that is spooky while still being palatable for kids.\n\nThe visuals of the stop-motion go a long way toward selling this idea, but the worldbuilding behind them is fine-tuned, from the creatures who live in Halloween Town to its hierarchy and structure to the wants and needs of its denizens.\n\nRead More: The Fundamentals of Worldbuilding in Screenwriting\n\n—\n\nThere is simply no limit to the worldbuilding that can be done — but when it is done well, the effects are magnetic and unforgettable. At the heart of every new world or town or galaxy is who lives in it and what they want. The worlds must serve the characters within them.\n\nThe reveals of the worlds must also serve the characters and the story you are telling. Revelations must be earned in order to deliver the most emotional impact for the characters — and the audience. It’s a delicate art, but rewatch films like these and you can see how the storytellers trickled breadcrumbs to lead viewers through the forests of their imagination.\n\nHappy writing!\n\n<Additional Information>{\"author\": \"Shannon Corbeil\", \"bio\": \"a writer, actor, and U.S. Air Force veteran in Los Angeles with appearances on SEAL Team and The Rookie.

Directed by Tim Miller (in his directorial debut) and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, it is a spin-off of the X-Men film series and its overall eighth installment. The film stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role, alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T.J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man responsible for giving him mutant abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the antihero Deadpool.\n\nFollowing a greenlight from 20th Century Fox in 2014 after test footage for a potential film was leaked, principal photography took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, between March and May 2015. Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the CGI character Colossus. Deadpool premiered at the Le Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released in the United States on February 12, following an unconventional marketing campaign.\n\nThe film achieved both financial and critical success, earning $782 million against a $58 million budget, becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series and the highest-grossing R-rated film at the time. Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style, faithfulness to the comics, and action sequences, though some criticized the plot as formulaic. The film received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice awards and two Golden Globe nominations. Two sequels have been released: Deadpool 2 (2018) and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine (2024), with the latter being part of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n## Plot\n\nAs the vigilante Deadpool, Wade Wilson ambushes Ajax and his convoy on an expressway. Throughout the ambush, Wade shows the viewer the events leading to how he became Deadpool. After being dishonorably discharged from the Canadian special forces, Wade works as a freelance mercenary until he meets a sex worker named Vanessa. They become romantically involved, and a year later, she accepts his marriage proposal. Wade is later diagnosed with terminal cancer and is approached by a mysterious recruiter who offers him an experimental treatment that will heal his cancer.\n\nWade leaves Vanessa so she will not have to watch him die. He is taken to a laboratory run by Ajax and Angel Dust, who injects him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes in his body. They subject Wade to days of torture to trigger any mutation but to no avail. When Wade discovers Ajax's real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wade in a hypobaric chamber that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend. This activates a regenerative healing factor that counteracts Wade's cancer but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like tumors all over his body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told his condition can be cured. In the chaos, Ajax subdues Wade and leaves him for dead.\n\nWade survives due to his new healing factor and seeks out Vanessa but does not reveal that he is alive out of fear that she will shun him because of his new scarred appearance. After consulting with his best friend Weasel, Wade decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a vigilante, adopting the name \"Deadpool\" (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. Throughout the following year, he questions and kills many of Ajax's associates until one, the recruiter, reveals Ajax's whereabouts. This information allows Wade to enact the ambush. He kills all of Ajax's henchmen, subdues Ajax, and demands the cure, but the X-Men Colossus and his trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead interrupt him. Colossus attempts to convince Wade to mend his ways and join the X-Men, but Wade turns him down. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes and regroups with Angel Dust. They then head to Weasel's bar, where Ajax hears of Vanessa.\n\nAjax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned Helicarrier in a scrapyard. In response, Wade convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him get her back. They battle Angel Dust and a group of Ajax's men while Wade fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the supports keeping the Helicarrier stable. Deadpool protects Vanessa as the ship collapses around them, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Wade again but is overpowered. He reveals that a cure never existed, and despite Colossus's pleas, Wade kills Ajax. Vanessa angrily berates Wade for leaving her but reconciles with him after she sees his disfigured face and learns the reason why he never came back to her.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Wade imitates the post-credits scene of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, stating they only have enough money left to announce that Cable will show up in the sequel and making casting suggestions for the character.[a]\n\n## Cast\n\n(L-R) Tim Miller, Reynolds, Baccarin, T. J. Miller, Hildebrand, Skrein, and Carano speaking at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool:\nA wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing, but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental cancer treatment.[3][4] The writers described Deadpool as \"fun to hang out with... in short doses\".[5] Reynolds promised a more \"authentic\" and comic-faithful version of the character than the one he portrayed in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009).[6] The character becomes aware he is in a film after becoming Deadpool, though before this, Wilson does make a joke about Reynolds's role in Green Lantern (2011).[7]\n- Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle:\nAn escort and Wilson's fiancée.[4][8] Baccarin described Vanessa as \"scrappy\" and not a damsel in distress. The character was initially designed as a \"typical prostitute\", but Baccarin worked with the costume and makeup teams to make her appearance more layered.[9] The film does not explore the character's comic alter ego Copycat, as the writers wanted to focus on Deadpool.[10] Makeup designer Bill Corso, however, included some references to Copycat's blue appearance in the comics.[11][12]\n- Ed Skrein as Francis Freeman / Ajax:\nThe artificially mutated leader of the program that creates Deadpool.[13] He is immune to pain and has enhanced strength and reflexes.[4] Director Tim Miller praised Skrein's dedication to the role, saying, \"he worked really, really hard\" for the fight sequences and completed around 80% of his own stunts in the film.[7] Skrein was influenced by Rutger Hauer's Roy Batty from Blade Runner (1982), and serial killer Harold Shipman.[14]\n- T.J. Miller as Weasel:\nWilson's best friend.[15][16] Miller felt he was cast as the character because he \"looks like his superhero power is spilling mustard on his shirt\". Producer Simon Kinberg added that an actor was needed \"who could keep up with\" Reynolds comedically. Miller attempted to give the character a facial tic, but director Tim Miller rejected the idea.[17]\n- Gina Carano as Angel Dust:\nAn artificially mutated member of the program that creates Deadpool.[18] She uses her adrenaline as fuel to increase her strength and durability to superhuman levels.[4] Director Miller personally called Carano and asked her to take the part. Carano felt the character's rage and \"extreme adrenaline issues\" made comparisons to the drug \"angel dust\" fitting.[18] She had wanted to wear yellow contact lenses to match the character's look in the comics, but Corso turned the idea down, comparing it to something from the Twilight films.[11]\n- Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead:\nA teenage X-Men trainee who can generate atomic bursts from her body.[4][19] The filmmakers wanted to use the character based on her name and looked to change her comic abilities from telepathic and precognitive powers to \"a literal warhead\". They required permission from Marvel to do this, which Tim Miller obtained after talking with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige.[7][20] A deal was reached allowing the change in exchange for 20th Century Fox giving Marvel Studios the film rights to the character Ego the Living Planet for use by James Gunn in their film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[21]\n\nStefan Kapičić provides the voice of Colossus, an X-Men who can transform his entire body into organic steel.[4][22] Writer Rhett Reese called him \"a great foil to Deadpool because he's very self-serious and goody-two-shoes\".[10] Director Miller changed the character drastically from his previous film appearances, where he was portrayed by Daniel Cudmore. Miller felt the Cudmore version, which he described as \"[t]hat dude with the shiny skin\" was not Colossus. He wanted the character to be seven and a half feet tall.[7] Andre Tricoteux was the body-double of Colossus on set,[23] and Kapičić was cast to give the character an \"authentic Russian accent\" as he has in the comics.[22]\n\nLeslie Uggams portrays Blind Al, an elderly blind woman and Deadpool's roommate.[24][25] Uggams said that Al has \"been through British Intelligence, she's done all kinds of wild and crazy things ... she's old, but she's feisty.\" Uggams added that Al has a \"love/hate\" relationship with Deadpool.[25] Karan Soni appears as Dopinder, a taxi driver who befriends Deadpool,[26] and Jed Rees portrays a recruiter for Ajax.[7] X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively.[27][28] Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool.[28] The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios. They did not permit him to be used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the Hydra organization are not referenced in the film. He is explained, instead, as a former special-forces operative like Wilson.[29] Hugh Jackman, who portrayed Logan / Wolverine in the X-Men film series, was very supportive of Deadpool and it making fun of himself and his character. He is seen in the film on a People magazine Sexiest Man Alive cover.[10] A scene featuring Nathan Fillion as a bathroom attendant was cut, but was included in the deleted scenes of the home media release.[30] Fillion would later voice Headpool in the 2024 sequel, Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.[31][32]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nArtisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on Marvel Comics' characters, including Deadpool.[33] By February 2004, writer and director David S. Goyer and Ryan Reynolds were working on a Deadpool film at New Line Cinema. They had worked together on the Marvel film Blade: Trinity.[34] Reynolds was interested in the part of Deadpool after learning that in the comics the character refers to his appearance as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar-Pei\".[35] New Line Cinema executive Jeff Katz, who thought Reynolds was the only actor suitable for the role, championed the idea. However, there were rights issues with 20th Century Fox and their X-Men films, and the project did not move forward.[36]\n\nBy March 2005, Reynolds learned that Fox had expressed interest in a film featuring Deadpool.[37] The character was set to make a cameo appearance in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, with Reynolds cast in the part. His role was expanded during the film's production.[38] Katz was an executive at Fox at that point and said that Deadpool was \"nicely set up to be explored in his own way\" in a future film.[36] The film's portrayal deviates from the original comic character, \"imbuing him with several superpowers and sewing his mouth shut\". Deadpool apparently dies in the film, though a post-credits scene showing him still alive was added to the film shortly before its release. After the successful opening weekend of Wolverine, Fox officially began development on Deadpool, with Reynolds attached to star and X-Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner involved. The spinoff was set to ignore the Wolverine version of Deadpool and return to the character's roots with a slapstick tone and a \"propensity to break the fourth wall\".[39]\n\nRhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January 2010.[40] Reynolds, who worked closely with them, said they were chosen because, \"Tonally, they got it. They just [understood Deadpool] right off the bat.\"[41] By that June, Robert Rodriguez had been asked to direct the film.[42] He confirmed this a month later, saying he had been sent a \"really good\" script and was considering taking on the project.[43] By October he was no longer interested in it, and Adam Berg was being looked at to direct the film.[44] In April 2011, Tim Miller was hired after working on the visual effects for some of the X-Men films,[45] in part because of his work creating animated short films. These included the Academy Award-winning Gopher Broke and a DC Universe Online trailer, which was \"epic and cinematic, everything [Fox wanted] their comic book movies to be\".[46][47] Miller would make his directorial debut with the film, while Reynolds closed a deal with Fox to produce the film.[45]\n\nReynolds' Green Lantern superhero film was released later in 2011 and was a disappointment. This tainted the Deadpool project. Fox executives were already concerned about its R-rated content. After several meetings the studio agreed the film could not be reconfigured for a more traditional PG-13 rating, and gave Miller \"a low-six-figure budget\" to produce some test footage.[46] He created the footage using CGI at his animation company Blur Studio in 2012, with Reynolds voicing Deadpool.[48] The footage did not convince Fox to green-light the film.[46] After the successful May release of Marvel Studios's The Avengers, Reese and Wernick thought Deadpool might be approved as an already developed superhero film. Fox was actually even more doubtful about the script, however, and began exploring ways to include Deadpool in an Avengers-esque team-up film.[49] At different times during development, James Cameron and David Fincher, both friends of Miller, read the film's script and championed the project to Fox executives.[50]\n\n\"I would have [leaked the test footage], if I had known it would have caused that! ... Now, we get to make the movie. We don't get to make it with the budget of most superhero movies, but we get to make it the way we want to make it.\"\n\nThe test footage was leaked online in July 2014,[52] and was met with an overwhelmingly enthusiastic response.[46] That September, Fox gave Deadpool a release date of February 12, 2016.[53] Production was set to begin in March 2015, with Simon Kinberg joining as producer.[3] Reynolds attributed Fox's green-lighting of the film entirely to the leak. He, Miller, and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves, and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so. He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox. In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted, Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films.[51]\n\n#### Writing\n\nReese and Wernick wrote a draft of the script every year for six years before completing the film,[10] with around 70 percent of the first draft ending up in the final film.[5] Reese described Reynolds as \"the keeper of the Deadpool flame for many years ... if we ever do something that is off the Deadpool path, or if it doesn't feel like Deadpool, he catches it.\"[54] The writers did not want the film to be an origin story, but Reynolds disagreed. They settled on a \"modern\" Deadpool story as well as the origin story connected by Deadpool's narration and fourth wall breaking. This helped to balance the darker origin story with the cartoon-like Deadpool scenes. It also allowed the opening fight sequence to be extended through the first half of the film (with the origin story told throughout), saving money on additional fight scenes.[10] This fight sequence labeled the \"Twelve Bullets Fight\" reimagines the original test footage.[7] Once the origin story is told, Deadpool uses a \"fast-forward button\" to return the audience to the present day.[10]\n\nIn October 2014, Kinberg confirmed that Deadpool would be set in the same shared universe as the X-Men films, but would \"stand independently\".[55] The writers wanted a traditional X-Man in the film as a foil to Deadpool and felt Colossus was a character who had not been explored much in previous films.[10] Miller wanted \"more superhero stuff\", instead of \"just Deadpool and a lot of guns\". The character Negasonic Teenage Warhead was added as a trainee X-Men mentored by Colossus.[7][10] She was chosen for her name from the list of comic characters available for use by Fox.[7] The characters Garrison Kane, Wyre and Sluggo were included in the script at one point, but ultimately removed for budgetary reasons.[7][50] These villains were replaced by a single character, Angel Dust.[56] Cannonball, Emrys Killebrew, Patch and Tar Baby were also considered.[7][57][14] The Cable character was also set to appear, but was eventually pushed to a potential sequel so this film could \"get Deadpool on his feet\" first.[50]\n\nThe writers worked to keep the script's pop-culture references up-to-date throughout its development.[14] Kinberg confirmed the film would make fun of Deadpool's portrayal in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.[55] It also includes jokes at the expense of Green Lantern.[7] While Miller felt it was okay for audience members not to understand all of the film's jokes, he wanted to avoid anything targeted specifically at comic fans. He was not in favor of any joke the audience \"needs to look up on the internet\" after the movie ends.[7] The film's post-credits scene is a parody of the equivalent scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), where the title character of that film breaks the fourth wall like Deadpool. In the parody scene, Deadpool wears a bath robe and tells the audience to go home.[58] He also confirms that Cable will appear in the sequel.[59] After reading the scene, a Fox executive described the film as a combination of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Natural Born Killers (1994), a description the writers felt was accurate.[58]\n\nCo-writer Rhett Reese said the studio's cuts to the film's budget made the script more efficient[56]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nForty-eight hours before the film received the official green light from Fox, the studio cut its budget by $7–$8 million[56] down to $58 million.[2] This forced a last minute re-write that saw about nine pages cut from the 110-page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase at the end of the Twelve Bullets Fight and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having to shoot a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, \"It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long. That was a function of budget more than anything, but I think it really made the movie pace nicely.\"[56]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nIn January 2015, T.J. Miller and Ed Skrein were in talks to appear in the film, with Miller as \"an additional comic voice\" and Skrein as a villain.[60] A month later, Fox was testing actresses to portray the female lead, including Morena Baccarin, Taylor Schilling, Crystal Reed, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Sarah Greene, and Jessica De Gouw.[61] Gina Carano was cast as Angel Dust, and Miller was confirmed for an unspecified role.[16] Baccarin was cast as Deadpool's love interest before the end of February.[8] Colossus actor Daniel Cudmore said he would not be reprising the role for Deadpool,[62] and declined an offer to provide reference for a CG version of the character to be voiced by another actor.[63]\n\nAn immediate focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit.[64] Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions were hired to create the costume. Shinkle noted that \"comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique\", and he tried to balance that with reality.[65] Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave it a slimmer, \"quintessential Deadpool\" look.[66] Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume.[66][67] Reynolds explained, \"we fought like hell... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That's hard to accomplish and a feat, but we're just so happy with how this came out.\"[67] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind. The mask's eye areas were removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without having to change the whole mask.[65] The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI. Visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed this on the suit's fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to \"get into the gutters and the cracks... [so when] the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt.\"[23] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.[68]\n\nMiller wanted Deadpool's scarred appearance to make him appear \"fucking horrible\" to justify his anger.[7] Makeup designer Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics \"he's everything from a rotten corpse to a guy with a couple of lines on his face\". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as \"disfigured\" but also wanted him to be \"kind of charming and iconic\". He wanted to avoid comparisons with Freddy Krueger and looked to Sin City (2005) for inspiration.[11] The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply.[69] For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply Reynolds' full-body makeup.[7] Corso described the makeup for the rest of the film's characters as \"pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded.\"[11]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 23, 2015, in Vancouver, British Columbia, under the working title Wham!. Filming took place at North Shore Studios and on location around the city.[70] The production hired more than 2,000 locals as actors, extras and crew members.[71] T. J. Miller and Baccarin were revealed to be playing Weasel and Vanessa, respectively.[15][72] Skrein confirmed he was in the film, playing Ajax.[73] Newcomer Brianna Hildebrand was cast as Negasonic Teenage Warhead.[19]\n\nTim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng wanted the film to look \"grittier and less clean and glossy\" than other superhero films. They decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in post-production to give the images texture. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, and Panavision Primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. The film's exterior scenes have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with \"unpredictable\" weather.[74] For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks and shot rain or shine before their permit expired. Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep a consistent look.[70][74] Production designer Sean Haworth, who had specific ideas for the sets, also worked closely with Miller. The production had to be very specific about which elements of each set were constructed to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI. A gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with many digital elements.[75][76] The final sequence was filmed in a naval yard dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.[77]\n\nStunt coordinator Philip J. Silvera in costume as Deadpool on set in Vancouver[78]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen Fox was unwilling to pay Reese and Wernick to be on set every day,[5] Reynolds paid their salaries.[79] The writers had scripted the action very specifically, \"every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot\", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators were free to change this.[5] Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the film's stunt coordinators;[23] Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage.[80] The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors. Skrein worked \"nonstop\" to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds \"has a photographic memory; he'd do something three or four times and remember it very well.\"[81] A lot of the film's jokes were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds.[10] He said the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints.[82] For example, Reese said Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic. Instead Reynolds improvised the line on set, \"It's funny that I only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another X-Men.\" This was based in truth and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos' favorite line.[10] Filming ended on May 29.[83]\n\n### Post-production\n\nLeslie Uggams said that she was in the film in July 2015 playing the role of Blind Al.[24] Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays \"The Recruiter\", and \"did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet\". Miller explained that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film,[7] with Andre Tricoteux cast to provide motion reference on set for the role along with the voice.[22][23] In December, the voice of Colossus was recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.[22]\n\nAs soon as editor Julian Clarke began selecting shots for the film, they were color graded by EFILM's Tim Stipan to ensure they all matched.[74][84] Stipan colored the characters slightly differently. He gave Deadpool a \"dark, modern touch\" and Colossus a \"particular vibrancy and substance\".[85] Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor, choosing between alternate takes of jokes. He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed. He cut down other scenes with fewer jokes, such as Wilson being tortured, as they were \"too much\". It would take the audience \"too long to recover [and] get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie.\" During editing, a linear version of the film was produced. Clarke decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones.[84]\n\nOne sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter. It was removed for pacing reasons and replaced with a short scene of Wilson sitting beside his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis. In its new context the scene implies him re-thinking the recruiter's offer.[86]\n\nBecause of the animation required for Deadpool's mask and Colossus, Reese and Wernick had more freedom than usual to keep adjusting the script during post-production. Reynolds recorded new dialogue using his iPhone, and then re-recorded the lines in an additional dialogue recording session once the film was finalized. Lines added after filming included Reynolds doing an impression of Wolverine star Hugh Jackman's natural Australian accent, and another where Deadpool asks whether the character Professor X is being portrayed by James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart at that point in the X-Men timeline. This became a favorite line in the film for many audience members.[87]\n\n#### Visual effects\n\nDigital Domain (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, Weta Digital, Rodeo FX, and Luma Pictures produced Deadpool's visual effects.[23] Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing a film that looked like others made with bigger budgets.[82] Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed, noting that Miller held off working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots that would not be used.[88] Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots—700 more than originally planned. 800 of them were completed in the last four weeks of production.[89]\n\nTop: Andre Tricoteux (center) on set as Colossus, wearing a gray tracking suit Bottom: Completed shot, with CG Colossus by Digital Domain and environment by Atomic Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nColossus's movements were re-recorded with performer T. J. Storm, as Tricoteux had been unable to move athletically because of the platform shoes he wore on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking \"chromey\", visiting a metal company to look at samples. They settled on cold rolled steel, with the darker hot rolled steel used for his hair. The model also includes ridges which could be moved separately to keep them perfectly straight as in the comic books.[23] DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all the FX vendors. His mask was animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics. This helped balance out the \"chinwag\" coming through the bottom of the mask as Reynolds acted. Fully replacing Deadpool's head was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital warped each shot based on facial references from Reynolds and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes instead. This was called an \"ingenious 2D-ish solution\".[23]\n\nAtomic Fiction created a freeway environment for the Twelve Bullets Fight, with a backdrop based on Detroit, Chicago, and Vancouver. They also created the vehicles used in the sequence.[23] These assets were used by Blur for the opening titles, which move through a frozen moment where Deadpool is fighting thugs inside a crashing car. The amusing titles include \"Directed by an overpaid tool\" and \"Produced by asshats\".[23] Reynolds, Miller, and the writers came up with their own credits hoping to set the tone for the film.[10]\n\nLuma contributed the film's blood and gore using practical footage as well as digital effects for more complex scenes. When Deadpool cuts off his own hand, DD did not want to be \"outdone\" by Luma and had \"buckets of blood pouring out\". Luma created the regrowing hand, inspired by the hand of a fetus.[23] When Deadpool breaks both his hands, DD went through 20 or 30 different versions of what broken fingers could look like.[71] For Deadpool's initial scarring from the warehouse fire, Rodeo FX referenced rotting fruit and maggot-eaten meat. The company added a CGI penis to Reynolds in this sequence, which visual effects supervisor Wayne Brinton said, \"you don't even notice [but] when it wasn't there it looked really weird\". Rodeo also augmented the practical fire in the scene.[23]\n\nThe vendors all collaborated for the final battle sequence, which takes place in the wreckage of a helicarrier. Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax; DD created most of the Colossus effects until he is damaged when Blur Studio took over; DD created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead's abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier's deck; Rodeo contributed matte paintings for the background; and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool.[23][90] Negasonic's abilities were the only \"supernatural effect-sy thing\" in the film, and were based on fuel-air explosives and solar flares to try to ground them in reality.[89] Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller's idea. This helped to expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and the wider Marvel Universe.[91] To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios, the helicarrier for Deadpool was designed to be \"as different as possible from the one in The Avengers\".[90] Additionally a French animation artist with a \"unique style\" created 2D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight.[23]\n\n## Music\n\nTom Holkenborg announced in October 2015 that he would compose the score for Deadpool.[92] Noting that Deadpool only makes pre-1990 musical references,[93] Holkenborg decided to use sounds from the 1980s in the movie's main theme, such as those of an Oberheim and a Synclavier.[94][95] Several songs were written in to Reese and Wernick's script to be used in the film. Some of these ultimately did not work as intended. For example, the sex montage with Wilson and Vanessa was to play along with Frank Sinatra's version of \"It Was a Very Good Year\" in the script, but it was changed to Neil Sedaka's \"Calendar Girl\" during editing.[86] A soundtrack album featuring Holkenborg's score and the songs heard in the film was released digitally on February 12, 2016, and physically on March 4 through Milan Records. The Deadpool rap was also featured, during the \"Finding Francis\" montage. Both the music of George Michael and his pop group Wham! are used throughout, with repeat reference to the Wham! album Make It Big.[96]\n\n## Marketing\n\nDue to the film's limited marketing budget, Reynolds worked closely with Fox's marketing chief Marc Weinstock to use the Internet to their advantage and come up with cheaper, \"Deadpool-based\" ways to market the film.[97][98] This included unique trailers,[99][100] unconventional billboards,[101][102] promotional tie-ins with Super Bowl 50 and Viacom,[103][104] and an extensive social media presence.[101] Reynolds kept one of the Deadpool costumes for himself, and appeared in it throughout the marketing campaign.[64] Visual effects vendor Image Engine animated Deadpool's mask for these appearances, using a process similar to that used by Weta Digital for the film.[23] Emma Grey Ellis at Wired.com described the campaign as \"crazy and unrelenting\" with Deadpool waging a \"marketing siege of every platform you would think of\".[101] Bobby Anhalt at Screen Rant called it possibly \"the best film marketing campaign in the history of cinema\".[102] HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed the campaign's success to Reynolds, and to Fox for embracing the film's R rating.[105]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nDeadpool's world premiere was held at the Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016,[106] before its initial theatrical release in Hong Kong the next day. This was followed by releases in 49 other markets over the next few days, including the United States on February 12.[53][107] The film was released in several formats, including IMAX, DLP, premium large formats, and D-Box.[86]\n\nKinberg explained that unlike the previous X-Men films, Deadpool is \"a hard R. It's graphic. Nothing is taboo. You either commit to a truly outrageous boundary-pushing kind of movie or you don't.\"[108] China forbade the film's release because of this. Though R-rated American films are often \"cleaned up\" for release there, it was decided that doing so was impossible without affecting the plot.[109] It was not released in Uzbekistan after theater owners in the country decided against showing the film because of its age restriction and how it violated the country's societal norms.[110] Deadpool received seven \"general cuts\" to obtain approval for release in India.[111] Despite being blocked in China during this initial release, Deadpool eventually premiered in the country during the 2018 Beijing International Film Festival, which ran over a week from April 15–22. The original version of the film played at the festival without any edits being made specifically for Chinese censors.[112][113]\n\n### Home media\n\nDeadpool was released for digital download on April 26, 2016, moved up from the physical home media release, which came on May 10. The latter release, for Blu-ray and DVD, included behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and two audio commentaries: one by Tim Miller and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld, and another by Reynolds, Reese, and Wernick.[114] On November 7, Fox rereleased the film and its special features on Blu-ray for the holiday season, as Deadpool's Holiday Blu-ray package.[115] The film was re-released again in April 2018 in a Deadpool Two Year Anniversary Edition Blu-ray package, with collectible covers as well as \"stickers, car decals, temporary tattoos and a set of paper dolls\". A 4K UHD Steelbook version was also released exclusively through Best Buy featuring original artwork.[116] Deadpool was made available on Disney+ in most regions excluding the United States on February 23, 2021, as part of the streamer's launch of the new Star hub which focused on adding more mature content.[117] As of July 2022, the film was also made available to stream on Disney+ in the United States, alongside Logan (2017) and Deadpool 2, marking the first R-rated films available on the streaming service in the U.S. region.[118]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nDeadpool grossed $363.1 million in the United States and Canada and $420 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $783.1 million, against a budget of $58 million.[2] It broke many records with its opening weekend gross across the world, and went on to become the highest-grossing X-Men film,[119][120] as well as the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2016.[121] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $322 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the second-most profitable release of 2016 and the second most profitable film of all time behind Joker (2019). When discussing potential reasons for the film's surprise success, the site highlighted its marketing campaign.[122] It also became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, dethroning The Matrix Reloaded until being beaten by Joker in 2019.[123]\n\nAt the end of January 2016, the film was projected to earn $55–60 million over its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.[124] Fox's rivals projected the film to earn closer to $80 million. It ultimately opened at No. 1, making $132.4 million for the weekend, and $152.2 million over the long Presidents' Day weekend.[125] Trying to explain this surprise, Fox's domestic distribution chief, Chris Aronson, said, \"It's hard to comp and predict. You're doing something that's never been done. It's like you throw the rulebook out the window.\" The weekend included $12.7 million from Thursday preview showings on February 11, $47.5 million on its opening day, $42.5 million on February 13, and $42.6 million on February 14, as well as $19.8 million on February 15 to end the long weekend. These were all day-of-the-week records for R-rated films and days in February for Thursday through Monday. $16.8 million of this came from IMAX screens, a record opening weekend for R-rated films and February releases in that format.[126] Deadpool also broke Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith's record for having the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film.[127][128] The film earned an additional $55 million in its second weekend.[129] This kept it at No. 1, and made it the fastest R-rated film to cross $200 million, doing so in nine days.[130][131] It became the highest-grossing X-Men film and R-rated comic book superhero film the next day.[132] It remained in the No. 1 position for its third week,[133] but fell behind Zootopia and London Has Fallen the following week.[134] Deadpool's domestic run ended on June 17, after 126 days, with $363.1 million.[2][135] This was shortly after it became the highest-grossing R-rated film worldwide.[119] The film's U.S. audience, across its whole run, was 59% white, 21% Hispanic, 12% African-American, and 8% Asian. It was also 62% male, and had an average age of 35.[136]\n\nThe film was released in 80 markets around the world, many of them in its first week. This included the United Kingdom, France, and Australia on its first day, February 9, where it was the No. 1 film and broke several records. The film also opened well in Asian countries, notably Taiwan—where Reynolds had traveled for promotion and made the \"central hub\" of South East Asia for the film—and Hong Kong, where the film had the biggest Chinese New Year single day ever.[107] It went on to gross $132.2 million for its international opening weekend, which included $9 million from IMAX showings breaking opening weekend records for February releases and R-rated films in that format in several markets. It was the No. 1 film in all markets where it was released over the weekend, except Poland and Malaysia where it was No. 2 behind local films Planet Single and The Mermaid, respectively.[137] The film broke the record for biggest opening weekend in Russia and Thailand, and set records for biggest R-rated film and February opening weekends in several other markets.[138] It remained No. 1 for the international box office in its second weekend, making an additional $84.7 million from 77 markets. The film made No. 1 debuts in 17 new countries, including Korea, Spain, and Italy, and maintained its No. 1 position in countries like the UK, Germany, and Brazil. Its South East Asia performance was compared favorably to bigger superhero films like Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (both 2014).[139] Deadpool was No. 1 for a third consecutive weekend,[140] before falling to No. 3 behind Ip Man 3 and Zootopia in its fourth.[141] Deadpool opened in its final market, Japan, in June, and was the No. 1 film there, with a $6.5 million opening weekend.[142]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 348 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Fast, funny, and gleefully profane, the fourth-wall-busting Deadpool subverts superhero film formula with wildly entertaining—and decidedly non-family-friendly—results.\"[143] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[144] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. PostTrak reported an average positive score of 97%, with 45% of filmgoers saying the film exceeded their expectations.[126]\n\nMichael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post scored Deadpool three-and-a-half out of four, calling it a \"voraciously self-aware comedy\" and the first R-rated Marvel film \"with real teeth\". He praised the film's attitude and tone, Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character and the film's action scenes.[145] TheWrap's Alonso Duralde said Deadpool \"shouldn't work, but it absolutely does\", feeling that it successfully balanced comedy with superhero action, and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence.[146] Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, saying it was \"smart, sexy, and outrageous\", but that it would not work without Reynolds.[147] The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave the film four out of five calling it \"neurotic and needy—and very entertaining\", comparing it to Kick-Ass (2010) and Kill Bill (2003). He did feel the film's villains were underused.[148] Writing for Uproxx, Drew McWeeny described it as \"the world's most violent and vulgar Bugs Bunny cartoon\", and praised the film's unconventional plot structure, its personal stakes, the difference in tone and storytelling from other superhero films, and the cast.[149] Variety's Justin Chang said the film is \"terribly arch and juvenile [but] also startlingly effective\", praising Reynolds' performance (and the film's willingness to hide his looks under prosthetics), the script, and director Miller for staying \"out of the way of his script and his star\".[150] Todd McCarthy at The Hollywood Reporter felt the film took a while to get going, \"but once it does, Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos\".[151]\n\nRolling Stone's Peter Travers said the film \"goes on too long and repetition dulls its initial cleverness\", but the \"junky feel is part of its charm\". He praised the cast, particularly Reynolds as well as Tim Miller's action sequences.[152] At The Boston Globe, Tom Russo gave the film three stars. He criticized the \"featherweight\" plot, but said that there is enough humor to support it, and that Reynolds was \"born to play\" Deadpool.[153] Chris Nashawaty graded the film a 'B' for Entertainment Weekly, saying it \"doesn't have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story\" but makes up for that with R-rated fun. Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film and is \"a blast of laughing gas in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously\".[154] Tasha Robinson at The Verge felt there was too much juvenile humor. She noted the film did not make homophobic, racist, or sexist jokes, and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material.[155] David Edelstein of Vulture said the film's jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains and noted the \"gratifyingly twisty\" structure.[156] Manohla Dargis at The New York Times was not impressed with the listing of the film's genre cliches in the opening credits before they were used. She highlighted the \"human\" elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did \"more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again\".[157] IndieWire's Kate Erbland gave the film a 'B−', praising its style, and Reynolds' Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold, but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on \"numbing\" violence and un-original swearing and nudity.[158]\n\nWriting for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan said that Deadpool \"gets off to a fun start\" but the character \"eventually wears out his welcome\". He noted that though the film has a complicated narrative, it is masking a conventional Marvel origin story. Turan did highlight the film's romantic element and Baccarin's performance.[159] Jonathon Pile of Empire gave the film three out of five, saying the number of jokes \"will soon numb you to their impact\". He called the film a fun alternative to other superhero films.[160] Robbie Collin at The Daily Telegraph also gave the film three out of five, saying it is not \"the future of superhero movies\", calling it \"an enjoyably obnoxious detour\". He felt some of the film's jokes about superhero cliches were out of date by the time the film was released.[161] The San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle did not appreciate the humor, fourth wall breaking, or violence. He concluded the film is \"bad, borderline garbage, but disturbing, too, in that it's just the kind of fake-clever awfulness that might be cinema's future\".[162]\n\n### Accolades\n\nDeadpool has received many awards and nominations, recognizing the film as a whole, as well as: the cast's performance, particularly Reynolds as Deadpool; several technical areas, including the film's makeup, sound, and visual effects; and the film's unconventional marketing campaign. It was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards,[163] four Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two),[164] a Directors Guild of America Award,[165] five Empire Awards,[166] seven Golden Trailer Awards (winning two),[167] a Hugo Award,[168] two Key Art Awards for marketing (winning both),[169] eight MTV Movie Awards (winning two),[170] a Producers Guild of America Award,[171] four People's Choice Awards (winning two),[172][173] three Saturn Awards (winning one),[174] six Teen Choice Awards (winning two),[175] and a Writers Guild of America Award.[176]\n\nAfter being nominated for awards such as the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, Deadpool was considered a serious contender by commentators for several Academy Awards, despite its content and tone.[177] This included potential nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and after its Producers Guild of America nomination, Best Picture.[178][179] When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been \"snubbed\".[180] Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that while the film \"earned a solid thumbs up from most\", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any \"depth or related subversion of its genre\". He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters have against superhero films; the lack of a targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who did not seem to be expecting any of the film's previous awards either; and the number of other films in contention, as \"2016 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies\".[181] A variant cover for Marvel Comics' X-Men Gold #1, with art by Ron Lim and released in April 2017, references Deadpool's Oscar snub.[182]\n\n### Cinematic impact\n\nBefore Deadpool's success, R-rated, comic-based films considered successful were 300 (2006) and Watchmen (2009), which earned about half the opening weekend gross of successful PG-13 superhero films. Kick-Ass, a film tonally similar to Deadpool, made even less with a $19.8 million opening. Many reasons were given why Deadpool went on to be more successful than these, including the popularity of the Marvel brand and Reynolds' performance.[126] Tom Huddleston Jr. wrote for Fortune that Deadpool was proof to Hollywood that R-rated films can be as successful as PG-13 films, \"particularly when fans see the rating itself as validation that the film is true to its source material\".[183]\n\nA Hollywood executive not involved with the film felt it succeeded because it \"has a self-deprecating tone that's riotous. It's never been done before. It's poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie?\" James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, rejected this saying Deadpool was a success because \"it's original, it's damn good... and it wasn't afraid to take risks\". Gunn hoped studios would learn \"the right lesson\" from the film and not just try to make more films like Deadpool.[184] After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes' Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was \"appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes\", but \"too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work\".[185] Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, \"Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?\"[186]\n\nIn March 2017, a Warner Bros. executive said that an R-rated DC Extended Universe film could \"absolutely\" happen,[187] while Sony Pictures began developing an R-rated adaptation of the character Venom with a smaller budget, inspired by Fox's success with Deadpool and Logan (even though Venom was released under the PG-13 rating).[188] In June, Kevin Feige said in response to the successes that, though Marvel Studios was not planning any R-rated films for its Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"it's not out of the question\".[189] After the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Marvel films like Deadpool, potentially under a \"Marvel-R\" brand, \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\".[190]\n\n## Sequels\n\nA sequel, Deadpool 2, was released in May 2018 to comparable critical and commercial success. Following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the character's film rights were returned to Marvel Studios alongside the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, a third film starring Reynolds and Hugh Jackman and integrating their characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), was released on July 26, 2024, as part of Phase Five of the MCU.\n\n### Deadpool 2\n\nBefore Deadpool's release, Fox green-lit a sequel with Reese and Wernick returning to write the screenplay.[191] The involvement of Reynolds and Tim Miller was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon in April,[192] but Miller left the film at the end of October over \"mutual creative differences\" with Reynolds.[193] The next month, David Leitch signed on to direct the sequel.[194] Leitch first made a short film, No Good Deed, which was written by Reese and Wernick.[195][196] Deadpool 2 was released on May 18, 2018,[197] with Baccarin,[198] T. J. Miller,[199] Uggams,[200] Hildebrand,[201] and Kapičić all returning.[201] Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz joined them as Cable and Domino respectively,[202] who are members of X-Force alongside Deadpool.[203]\n\n### Deadpool &amp; Wolverine\n\nIn March 2017, Reese said that a future film focused on X-Force would be separate from Deadpool 3, \"so I think we'll be able to take two paths. X-Force is where we're launching something bigger, but then Deadpool 3 is where we're contracting and staying personal and small.\"[204] After the acquisition of Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017 and completed in March 2019, Disney's CEO Bob Iger stated that Deadpool and other Marvel properties at Fox would be integrated with the MCU under Marvel Studios.[205] In December 2019, Reynolds confirmed that a third Deadpool film was in development at Marvel Studios;[206] this was reiterated in January 2021 by Kevin Feige, who also confirmed that the film would be set in the MCU.[207]\n\nIn March 2022, Shawn Levy (who previously collaborated with Reynolds on Free Guy and The Adam Project) joined as director, with Reese and Wernick returning to write the screenplay.[208] The film was released on July 26, 2024, with Hugh Jackman reprising his role as Wolverine.[209]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ As would later be depicted in Deadpool 2 (2018).\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Deadpool (15)\".

The first in the Sonic film series, it was directed by Jeff Fowler, written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller, and stars James Marsden and Jim Carrey. Ben Schwartz voices Sonic, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and teams up with small town sheriff Tom Wachowski (Marsden) to stop the mad scientist Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Carrey).\n\nDevelopment for a Sonic film began in the 1990s but did not leave the planning stage until Sony Pictures acquired the film rights in 2013. Fowler was brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in turnaround, Paramount Pictures acquired it in 2017. Most of the cast signed on by August 2018. Principal photography took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer, released in April 2019, Paramount delayed the film by three months to redesign Sonic.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020. It was theatrically released in the United States on February 14 and in Japan on June 26, and received mixed reviews. It set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game film in the United States and Canada and grossed $320 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2020 and the highest-grossing video game film adaptation in North America.\n\nThe film spawned a franchise, consisting of two sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022) and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024), and a Paramount+ miniseries, Knuckles (2024). A fourth film is due to be released on March 19, 2027.\n\n## Plot\n\nSonic, a young anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speed, is unexpectedly ambushex by an echidna tribe on his home. His guardian, an anthropomorphic owl named Longclaw, gives him a bag of golden rings that open portals to distant locations. She uses one to send him to Earth while she stays behind to hold off the echidnas.\n\nTen years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life in a dark cave under the rural town of Green Hills, Montana, but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his wife, Maddie, unaware that the pair plans to relocate to San Francisco as Tom intends to accept a job at the San Francisco Police Department.\n\nOne night, Sonic grows sad over his loneliness while playing baseball alone. While running at unusually high speeds to clear his mind, he accidentally triggers an electromagnetic pulse that causes a massive power outage across the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Department of Defense reluctantly enlists the services of eccentric roboticist and scientific genius Dr. Ivo Robotnik to determine the cause of the outage. Realizing his cover has been blown, Sonic reluctantly plans to leave Earth and live on a different planet that only contains mushrooms.\n\nAs Sonic prepares to leave, Tom discovers him in his shed and accidentally tranquilizes him, causing Sonic to accidentally open a portal to San Francisco and drop his bag of rings through the portal to the Transamerica Pyramid's roof before passing out. After Sonic recovers, Tom hesitantly agrees to help him, and the two flee when confronted by Robotnik, who falsely labels Tom a domestic terrorist. The two bond as they make their way to San Francisco, with Tom relating to Sonic's desire for friends. Sonic creates a bucket list in a western-themed bar where Tom helps him complete several entries, culminating in a bar fight.\n\nMeanwhile, Robotnik discovers that one of Sonic's quills holds a limitless amount of energy, which he plans to harness by capturing him. As he tracks them down, Sonic and Tom manage to fight off mechanized drones sent by Robotnik, but Sonic is injured in the battle. Arriving in San Francisco, Tom brings Sonic to Maddie, who treats him at her sister Rachel's home. Sonic, Tom, and Maddie head to the roof of the Transamerica Pyramid and recover the rings as Robotnik arrives in an advanced hovercraft powered by the quill. Sonic fights off Robotnik's drones, hastily protecting Tom and Maddie by sending them back to Green Hills with one of his rings; however, Robotnik uses the quill's power to match Sonic's speed and pursues him across the world, eventually subduing him in Green Hills. Tom and the townsfolk intervene, and Tom acknowledges Sonic as his friend, causing Sonic to regain consciousness and maximum strength. Sonic defeats Robotnik by destroying his hovercraft and, with help from Tom, sends him through a ring portal to the mushroom planet.\n\nFollowing the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them, treating him as a surrogate son. The government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill and equipment salvaged from the remains of his hovercraft, plans to return to Earth for revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, Tails emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic on Earth for help him on a mission\n\n## Cast\n\n### Voice cast\n\n- Ben Schwartz as Sonic the Hedgehog , an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog with superhuman speed who finds himself on the run from Robotnik and the United States Government .

Fulks as Longclaw, an anthropomorphic brown owl and Sonic's caregiver.[11]\n\nAdditionally, Colleen O'Shaughnessey reprises her role from the games as Miles \"Tails\" Prower, an anthropomorphic yellow-orange two-tailed fox, in the mid-credits scene.[12]\n\n### Live-action cast\n\n- James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, the sheriff of Green Hills who became a father figure to Sonic and aids him in his quest to stop Robotnik.[13]\n- Tika Sumpter as Maddie Wachowski, a veterinarian and Tom's wife, who helps him and Sonic stop Robotnik.[14]\n- Jim Carrey as Dr. Ivo Robotnik, a brilliant robotics expert and mad scientist who works with the American government, covets Sonic's abilities, and plans to exploit them for personal gain, leading him to become Sonic's archenemy.[15] Carrey compared his character to his portrayal of the Riddler in Batman Forever (1995), saying: \"I wouldn't put one against the other. I think they'd be a great team. But you know, it's like Robotnik and every supervillain basically comes from a place of neglect with a feeling of absolute worthlessness that manifests itself in magnificent creations that are designed to control the world, put their brand on everybody, and maybe even get inside your bloodstream with some nanotechnology occasionally.\"[16]\n- Lee Majdoub as Agent Stone, a government agent who works for Ivo.[17]\n- Adam Pally as Wade Whipple, a dimwitted deputy sheriff in Green Hills and Tom's closest loyal friend.[18]\n- Natasha Rothwell as Rachel, Maddie's older sister who dislikes Tom and frequently attempts to encourage Maddie to leave him.[19]\n- Tom Butler as Commander Walters, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who orders Robotnik to investigate the power outage caused by Sonic.[20]\n- Neal McDonough as Major Bennington, a soldier tasked with assisting Robotnik in his efforts to capture Sonic.[18]\n- Frank C.

Michealene Risley, the newly appointed consumer products director who helped license Sonic for Adventures, negotiated with several Hollywood producers. Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske was wary of damaging the brand, citing the commercial and critical failures of the Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter films. Despite Kalinske's concerns, Sega was enthusiastic. In August 1994, Sega struck a development deal with MGM and Trilogy Entertainment Group, with Pen Densham as executive producer.[24]\n\nMGM and Sega hired Richard Jefferies, an associate of Risley from her days at Marvel Comics, to write a film treatment. At the time, Sega was developing the video game Sonic X-treme (which was canceled in late 1996) for its next console, the Sega Saturn, and asked Jefferies to feature the Saturn in the screenplay. Jefferies' treatment, Sonic: Wonders of the World, was submitted in May 1995. While the draft received a positive response among MGM and Sega executives, Sega COO Shinobu Toyoda suggested Kalinske replace Robotnik with a meaner villain. MGM canceled the project after a failed attempt to revive it at DreamWorks. Jefferies suggested that the film was scrapped as both Sega and MGM wanted a higher share of the profits, while Densham said it followed creative differences between Sega and Trilogy.[24]\n\nDuring the late 1990s, Ben Hurst attempted to revive and properly conclude the animated Sonic the Hedgehog television series, in which he worked as a writer. After failing to tell the conclusion in an Archie Sonic Super Special comic,[25] and after being dissuaded from attempting to continue the series as a network show during an interview with Robby London,” a DIC Entertainment executive, he decided to pursue telling the rest of the SatAM story in a feature film. Robby London put Hurst in contact with a Sega executive interested in the idea. Hurst was contacted by Ken Penders, writer of the Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series, who had been alerted of Hurst's plans. Though Hurst told him his strategy and offered to include him in his effort, Penders allegedly told Sega that Hurst was trying to co-opt the franchise, leading Sega to dismiss Hurst and his proposal.[26] Ben would attempt to get the movie made once more from 2005 to 2006, but this ultimately fell through.\n\nIn September 2003, Ken Penders pitched his own concept for a Sonic film, Sonic Armageddon. In Penders' words, the movie would have been an origin story and a series reset, resolving the plot threads which began in the animated Sonic show and continued in Archie's comic series. The project was dropped in 2007 due to a corporate upheaval and the death of Sega licensing manager Robert Leffler, who had supported Penders.[27]\n\n### Development\n\nThe film's logo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the rights to produce and distribute a Sonic film.[28] On June 10, 2014, a live-action animated film was announced as a joint venture between Sony Pictures's Columbia Pictures and Marza Animation Planet, a Japan-based subsidiary of Sega Sammy Holdings which had produced CGI cutscenes for several Sonic games.[29] It would be produced by Neal H. Moritz by his Original Film banner alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara, and written by Evan Susser and Van Robichaux.[29] In February 2016, Sega CEO said the film was scheduled for 2018.[30] Hajime Satomi, Blur Studio's Tim Miller, and Jeff Fowler were hired in 2016 to develop it; Fowler would make his feature directorial debut, and Miller would serve as executive producer. Blur Studio previously produced cutscenes for the games Shadow the Hedgehog (2005), for which Fowler directed cutscenes, and Sonic the Hedgehog (2006).[31] Patrick Casey, Josh Miller, and Oren Uziel were writing the screenplay, while Casey and Miller wrote the story, however, the former two received their writing credit and Uziel went uncredited.[31][32]\n\nOn October 2, 2017, Paramount Pictures announced that they had acquired the rights after Sony put the film in turnaround. Almost all of the production team remained unchanged. Coincidentally, Paramount and Sega had once been sister companies under Gulf and Western Industries; Gulf and Western sold Sega's assets in 1984.[33] In February 2018, it was announced that the film would be released in November 2019.[34][35] During production the film used the working title \"Casino Night\", named after one of the stages in the Sonic games.[36] Early drafts featured Sonic's Super Sonic form from the video games; the ideas were latterly discarded, as Fowler felt that \"it didn't make sense to obviously bring in the Super Sonic thing just yet\" and instead wanted to focus on the origins of Sonic and Robotnik's relationship.[37] Casey and Miller reportedly described the film as not faithful to the game, while producer Toby Ascher favored their buddy comedy approach.[38]\n\n### Casting\n\nIn May 2018, it was reported that Paul Rudd was in talks for a lead role as Tom, \"a cop who befriends Sonic and will likely team up to defeat Dr. Robotnik\"; however, this was later denied by Paramount.[39] A day later, it was announced that James Marsden was cast in an undisclosed role but later revealed to be Tom Wachowski.[13] In June, Tika Sumpter was cast as Tom's wife Maddie, with Jim Carrey cast to play the villain, Dr. Robotnik.[40]\n\nIn August, Ben Schwartz joined the cast to voice Sonic.[41] This marked a rare occasion in which the character would not be voiced by Roger Craig Smith, who voices Sonic in most incarnations since 2010.[42] Schwartz, a fan of the original video games, was chosen for the role after Fowler and Miller cast him for a test reading as they pitched the project to several studios.[43] Having enjoyed his performance, they officially cast Schwartz as the voice of Sonic.[43] Adam Pally and Neal McDonough were added to the cast later that month.[44] Debs Howard and Elfina Luk joined the cast the following November.[45] Riff Raff was cast in an undisclosed role but was cut from the film.[46][47][48]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in mid-September 2018 and ended in Vancouver, Ladysmith, and Vancouver Island on October 16, 2018.[49] Key production scenes were also filmed in Liwa Oasis, United Arab Emirates.[50] During filming, Ben Schwartz was unavailable, so a stand-in performed alongside Marsden.[51]\n\n### Visual effects and design\n\nThe visual effects are provided by Moving Picture Company (MPC), Marza Animation Planet, Blur Studio, Trixter, and Digital Domain.[52] The production team created a live-action version of Sonic using CGI, adding fur, new running sneakers, two separate eyes,[53] and a more human like physique.[54] They used Ted, the living teddy bear from the Ted films, as a reference to insert a CGI character into a real-world setting. Executive producer Miller said: \"It would be weird, and it would feel like he was running around nude if he was some sort of otter-like thing. It was always, for us, fur, and we never considered anything different. It's part of what integrates him into the real world and makes him a real creature.\" According to Miller, Sega was not \"entirely happy\" with the design of Sonic's eyes.[53]\n\nOn May 2, 2019, in response to the criticism, Fowler announced on Twitter that Sonic would be redesigned.[55] The film was delayed from its original release date of November 8, 2019, to February 14, 2020, as a result.[56] Artist Tyson Hesse, who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog media, was brought on to lead the redesign. Sonic was given larger and differently colored eyes, new sneakers, white gloves, and a less humanlike body to better resemble Sonic's video game design.[57] Sonic was redesigned by Marza Animation Planet.[58] The redesign added an estimated $5 million to the production budget,[59] took around five months, and was achieved without overtime.[60]\n\n## Music\n\nIn February 2019, Tom Holkenborg, who previously worked with executive producer Miller on Deadpool, was hired to compose the score.[61] The soundtrack was released alongside the film on February 14, 2020, in both digital and physical formats. Riff Raff, who had a role in the film but was cut due to controversy against him, appears on the soundtrack.[62] An original song, \"Boom\" by X Ambassadors, appears on the soundtrack, the single was released on January 24, 2020, by Atlantic Records. \"Speed Me Up\" by American musicians Wiz Khalifa, Lil Yachty, Ty Dolla Sign, and Sueco the Child received 15 million streams, along with 1.8 billion views for the \"Speed Me Up\" TikTok challenge.[63] \"Friends\" by Hyper Potions, which previously appeared as the opening theme of Sonic Mania, also appears, along with arrangements of tracks from Masato Nakamura's score for the original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991).[64] Holkenborg attempted to capture the feel of Nakamura's soundtracks for the Sonic and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992) games, using Yamaha digital FM synthesizers (such as the DX7) similar to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console's Yamaha YM2612 sound chip.[65][66]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nJim Carrey (right) at the premiere of the film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSonic the Hedgehog was scheduled for 2018 by Sony Pictures Releasing.[30] In February 2018, shortly after taking over the rights, Paramount Pictures rescheduled the film to November 15, 2019.[67] It was later moved up to a week earlier on November 8.[68] Following the announcement of Sonic's redesign in May 2019, the film was delayed for the final time by three months, to February 14, 2020; this was to provide enough time for the redesign to be completed.[69] Playing with Fire took the original release date.[70][71] The world premiere took place at the Paramount Pictures studio lot in Los Angeles on January 25, 2020.[72] The film was released theatrically in the United States in 4DX and Dolby Cinema formats.[73][74] The film was originally going to be released in Japan on March 27, 2020, but had to be delayed to June 26, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[75]\n\n### Marketing\n\nTest footage was screened at the Comic Con Experience in Brazil on December 9, 2018.[76] It was followed by a teaser poster released on December 9, 2018, revealing the silhouette design of Sonic, with the tagline \"A Whole New Speed of Hero\".[53] It received a negative response from critics and fans,[77] and was compared unfavorably to another 2019 video game film adaptation, Detective Pikachu, which added fur and skin textures to the Pokémon characters.[54] Sonic's humanoid appearance was described as evoking an uncanny valley response.[78] Former members of Sonic Team, who created the Sonic the Hedgehog games, also expressed surprise.[79] A second poster was leaked online shortly after. Fans complained of a lack of resemblance to the games and criticized the positioning of Sonic's legs, spawning an Internet meme in which users recreated the position.[80][81] The film's official Twitter account posted an image of Sonic behind a sign reading: \"Can't a guy work out?\"[82] Images of the Sonic design were leaked in March 2019 to more fan criticism. Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka was \"shocked\" by the design and felt the ratio of Sonic's head and abdomen was imbalanced.[83]\n\nThe film was delayed to re-design Sonic after the original design (pictured) was heavily criticized.[55]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe first trailer premiered on April 4, 2019, at CinemaCon in Las Vegas,[84] and was released online on April 30. It received near-unanimous criticism,[85][86][87] with Gita Jackson of Kotaku calling it \"horrific\" and \"a blight upon this weary earth\".[85] Sonic's design was heavily criticized by fans for its humanoid appearance,[85][87] while some found the use of Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" jarring.[88][89] Conversely, CNET's Sean Keane praised the humor and references to the games.[90] Within two days, the trailer was viewed more than 20 million times on YouTube, and had received hundreds of thousands of dislikes, drastically outnumbering its likes.[91]\n\nA second trailer revealing the redesigned Sonic was released on November 12, 2019.[92] The trailer received far more positive responses, with many praising Sonic's new design. The tone and the humor also received positive reviews, as did the choice of song, J. J. Fad's \"Supersonic\" and Ramones' \"Blitzkrieg Bop\".[93] Naka said he felt the new design was \"much more Sonic-like\".[94] The second trailer received thousands of likes and the highest like-to-dislike ratio of any trailer on Google in the last three years.[95] The trailers have garnered a total of more than 500 million views worldwide.[63] As a promotional tie-in, the version of Sonic seen in the film was added as a playable character to the mobile games Sonic Dash and Sonic Forces.[96] Since Sonic the Hedgehog, other films and television series based on video game series have made it a production priority to assure characters and the details of the film are true to the works they are based on to appeal better to viewers that are fans of the games.[97]\n\nA modified version of the original design, named \"Ugly Sonic\", appears as a supporting character in the 2022 film Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers, playing off the Internet's reaction to the first trailer. According to that film's director Akiva Schaffer, they had also used Moving Picture Company for their animation studio, and MPC was able to provide the original Sonic model for the film.[98] The character was voiced in the film by comedian Tim Robinson.[99]\n\n### Home media\n\nOn March 20, 2020, Paramount announced that Sonic the Hedgehog would be released to home media in the United States and Canada before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run, as many film studios took the decision to release films earlier due to movie theaters closures in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.[100] The digital version was released on March 31, 2020,[100] and was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray by Paramount Home Entertainment on May 19, 2020. All home media releases include an original short film, Around the World in 80 Seconds.[101][102]\n\nThe film topped the American Blu-ray and DVD charts for several weeks upon release.[3] It was the sixth top-selling home video title of 2020 in the United States.[103] The DVD and Blu-ray releases crossed 2 million units sold in the United States by January 2021 and earned about $50 million in US sales revenue as of 16 April 2022[update].[3]\n\nThe movie then made its move to streaming service Hulu on February 18, 2021, and on Amazon Prime Video the next day on February 19, 2021.[104]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nSonic the Hedgehog grossed $149 million in the United States and Canada, and $170.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $320 million.[8] It was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2020, and the highest-grossing superhero film of the year, ending Marvel Studios' decade-long run of having the highest-grossing film of the genre (from 2010 to 2019).[105][106] The film's budget was estimated at being between $85 million[8] and $90 million.[107][108][3]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Fantasy Island, The Photograph, and Downhill, and was initially projected to gross $40–50 million from 4,130 theaters in its four-day President's Day opening weekend.[109][110] After making $21 million on its first day (including $3 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were raised to $64 million.[111] It went on to top the box office with a $58 million debut over the three-day weekend, and $70 million over the four, breaking Detective Pikachu's record for the biggest opening weekend by a video game-based film. It was also the fourth-best President's Day holiday weekend and Jim Carrey's second biggest opening weekend, behind Bruce Almighty (2003).[63] The success was attributed in part to the redesign of Sonic and the publicity it created, and the delayed release date, which meant it opened with less competition from other family films.[112] Opening day audiences were 56% male and 44% female, with 70% under 25 years.[63] In its second weekend, Sonic the Hedgehog made $26.2 million and retained the top spot at the box office, bringing its ten-day domestic gross to $106.6 million.[113][114] Sonic the Hedgehog made $16.3 million in its third weekend and was dethroned by newcomer The Invisible Man.[115] On March 14, 2020, it became the highest-grossing film based on a video game in US box office history, surpassing Detective Pikachu.[116]\n\nSonic the Hedgehog was released in 40 countries during its three-day opening weekend, topping the international box office with $43 million. Its strongest international regions were Latin America and Europe, with its largest openings being $6.7 million in Mexico, $6.2 million in the United Kingdom, $4.3 million in France, $3.3 million in Germany, and $3 million in Brazil. Worldwide, it made $101 million over the three-day weekend and $113 million over the four days.[117][118] In its second weekend the film again topped the international box office with $38.3 million from 56 countries for a ten-day overseas gross of $96.5 million, and topped the global box office again with $64.6 million for a ten-day worldwide gross of $203.1 million. Its largest international markets in its first ten days were the United Kingdom ($19.1 million), Mexico ($12.3 million), and France ($9.1 million), retaining the top spot in these markets. The film opened in 16 new markets, led by a number-one debut in Russia ($6.3 million).[119] The film was released in Japan on June 26, 2020, after being postponed from a previous March release due to the COVID-19 pandemic  and debuted at No. 6 that weekend.[120][121] In China, the release was also postponed due to the pandemic,[122] eventually receiving a July 31 date and underperforming at the Chinese box office due to new pandemic-related theatre policies there.[123][124]\n\nIn terms of box office admissions, the film sold 15,876,790 tickets in the United States and Canada (annual rank #3), 6,811,679 tickets in Mexico (annual #1), 893,634 tickets in Peru (annual #2), 468,697 tickets in Ecuador (annual #1), 67,230 tickets in the Dominican Republic (annual #2),[125] 12,454,206 tickets in Europe (annual #3),[126][127] 3,001,403 tickets in Brazil (annual #3),[128] 698,500 tickets in China,[129] 687,740 tickets in Argentina (annual #3),[130] and 118,725 tickets in South Korea,[131] for a combined 41,078,604 tickets sold in these territories.\n\n### Critical response\n\nSonic the Hedgehog received mixed reviews, with critics praising Sonic's redesign, humor and cast performances, but criticizing its product placements and unoriginal story.[132][133][134][135][136] On Rotten Tomatoes, 64% of 252 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Fittingly fleet and frequently fun, Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game-inspired adventure the whole family can enjoy -- and a fine excuse for Jim Carrey to tap into the manic energy that launched his career.\"[137] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[138] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 4 out of 5 stars, with 66% of viewers they surveyed saying they would definitely recommend it.[63]\n\nAkeem Lawanson of IGN gave the film a score of 7 out of 10, praising the performances and the nostalgia, stating, \"While this family-friendly action-comedy suffers from a simplistic story and leans too heavily on tired visual clichés, Sonic the Hedgehog is nevertheless boosted by solid performances from Ben Schwartz as Sonic and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Their ongoing cat-and-mouse game is entertaining, and passionate fans of the Sega franchise should appreciate all the nods to Sonic's history.\"[139] Dami Lee of The Verge gave the film a positive review, praising the nostalgic elements seen in the film, writing that it \"shines when it remembers it's based on a video game, and there's some genuinely fun stuff—like when Sonic uses his time-stopping powers or Robotnik's elaborate 'evil-plotting' montage that makes you wonder why more movies don't feature bad guys with choreographed dance sequences. Carrey plays up Robotnik as the cartoon villain he is, and it's a true delight to watch him in his element.\"[140] Corey Plante of Inverse called it a \"road trip superhero movie\" and \"the best superhero movie of 2020\" so far.[141] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter, gave the film a positive review, saying: \"Flesh-and-blood actors help keep this game derived kids' flick afloat.\"[142]\n\nGene Park of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying it was \"the furthest thing from Cats, despite the early comparisons. Wary fans expecting the usual easy target to mock will instead find something to fervently celebrate for years.\"[143] Amon Warrman of Empire gave the film two out of five stars, writing, \"An on-form Jim Carrey can't stop Sonic's live-action debut from feeling like a missed opportunity. If the teased sequels do materialize, here's hoping the storytelling levels up.\"[144] Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave the film a negative review and wrote, \"Sonic now resembles a cartoon hedgehog instead of a spray-painted marmot. But if anything was done to de-genericize the script, it hasn't helped. Not that the Sega games—in which the fleet-footed hero zips around doing flips and collecting gold coins (which here encircle the Paramount Mountain) gave the director, Jeff Fowler, much to work with.\"[145]\n\nVariety's Owen Gleiberman criticized the tone: \"For all the borderline tedium I felt at Sonic the Hedgehog, I do realize that this is a picture made for 8-year-olds. And they'll probably like it just fine. Yet I would also call the overly kiddified tone of the movie a mistake.\"[146] Writing for The Guardian, Steve Rose gave the film two out of five, saying elements were \"clearly indebted\" to other films, such as Quicksilver's powers in the X-Men movies, and finding the message of friendship \"trite and familiar\".[147] Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film one out of four, writing, \"Sonic the Hedgehog is only as successful as the amount of time you want to spend watching its animated protagonist go on instantly forgettable adventures, and boy, is that unfortunate.\"[148] Tim Grierson of Screen Daily also gave the film a negative review, writing, \"The film projects enough benign cheerfulness that the experience is never unpleasant, but one can't help but feel the filmmakers' strain in crafting a sly action-comedy for audiences expecting over-the-top spectacle and nonstop quips. Sadly, Sonic isn't swift enough to deliver.\"[149]\n\n### Accolades\n\n|   Year  | Award                                | Category                         | Recipients                  | Result    | Ref.       |\n|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|------------|\n|   2020  | SXSW Film Festival                   | Excellence in Title Design       | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [150][151] |\n|   2020  | People's Choice Awards               | The Family Movie of 2020         | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [152]      |\n|   2021  | Critics' Choice Super Awards         | Best Superhero Movie             | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [153][154] |\n|   2021  | Critics' Choice Super Awards         | Best Villain in a Movie          | Jim Carrey                  | Won       | [153][154] |\n|   2021  | Critics' Choice Super Awards         | Best Actor in a Superhero Movie  | Ben Schwartz and Jim Carrey | Nominated | [153][154] |\n|   2021  | Hollywood Critics Association Awards | Best Animated or VFX Performance | Ben Schwartz                | Won       | [155]      |\n|   2021  | Hollywood Critics Association Awards | Best Blockbuster                 | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [155]      |\n|   2021  | Hollywood Critics Association Awards | Best Visual Effects              | Ged Wright                  | Nominated | [155]      |\n|   2021  | Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards      | Favorite Movie                   | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [156]      |\n|   2021  | Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards      | Favorite Movie Actor             | Jim Carrey                  | Nominated | [156]      |\n|   2021  | Ursa Major Awards                    | Best Motion Picture              | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [157][158] |\n|   2021  | Saturn Awards                        | Best Fantasy Film Release        | Sonic the Hedgehog          | Nominated | [159]      |\n\n## Sequels and other media\n\nA novel based on the film, Sonic the Hedgehog: The Official Movie Novelization, written by Kiel Phegley and published by Penguin Books, was released alongside the film on February 14, 2020.[160] Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in 2022, followed by Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in 2024.[161][162] In April 2024, a spin-off miniseries, Knuckles, starring Idris Elba as Knuckles the Echidna, was released on Paramount+.[163] In December 2024, a fourth film was announced[164] and is set to release in theatres on March 19, 2027.[165]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films based on video games\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Sonic Team, published by Sega, directed and programmed by Yuji Naka, designed by Hirokazu Yasuhara, and illustrated by Naoto Ohshima.[1][2]\n- ^ Known in Japan as Sonic the Movie (Japanese: ソニック・ザ・ムービー, Hepburn: Sonikku za Mūbī)\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The bizarre evolution of Sonic the Hedgehog\".

It stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. It also stars Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis, and features Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and William Atherton in supporting roles.\n\nBased on his fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project starring himself and John Belushi, in which they would venture through time and space battling supernatural threats. Following Belushi's death in 1982, and with Aykroyd's concept deemed financially impractical, Ramis was hired to help rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. It was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects, and Columbia Pictures, concerned about its relatively high $25–30 million budget, had little faith in its box office potential. Filming took place from October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles. Due to competition for special effects studios among various films in development at the time, Richard Edlund used part of the budget to found Boss Film Studios, which employed a combination of practical effects, miniatures, and puppets to deliver the ghoulish visuals.\n\nGhostbusters was released on June 8, 1984, to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon. It was praised for its blend of comedy, action, and horror, and Murray's performance was often singled out for praise. It earned at least $282 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1984 in the United States and Canada, and the then-highest-grossing comedy ever. It was the number-one film in US theaters for seven consecutive weeks and one of only four films to gross more than $100 million that year. Further theatrical releases have increased the worldwide total gross to around $370 million, making it one of the most successful comedy films of the 1980s. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Its theme song, \"Ghostbusters\" by Ray Parker Jr., was also a number-one hit.\n\nWith its effect on popular culture, and a dedicated fan following, the success of Ghostbusters launched a multi-billion dollar multimedia franchise. This included the popular animated television series The Real Ghostbusters (1986), its follow-up Extreme Ghostbusters (1997), video games, board games, comic books, clothing, music, and haunted attractions. Ghostbusters was followed in 1989 by Ghostbusters II, which fared less well financially and critically, and attempts to develop a second sequel paused in 2014 following Ramis's death. After a 2016 reboot received mixed reviews and underperformed financially, a second sequel to the 1984 film, Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), was released, followed by Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024).\n\n## Plot\n\nAfter Columbia University parapsychology professors Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler experience their first encounter with a ghost at the New York Public Library, the university dean dismisses the credibility of their paranormal-focused research and fires them. The trio responds by establishing \"Ghostbusters\", a paranormal investigation and elimination service operating out of a disused firehouse. They develop high-tech nuclear-powered equipment to capture and contain ghosts, although business is initially slow.\n\nFollowing a paranormal encounter in her apartment, cellist Dana Barrett visits the Ghostbusters. She recounts witnessing a demonic dog-like creature in her refrigerator utter a single word: \"Zuul\". Ray and Egon research Zuul and details of Dana's building while Peter inspects her apartment and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her. The Ghostbusters are hired to remove a gluttonous ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel. Having failed to properly test their equipment, Egon warns the group that crossing the energy streams of their proton pack weapons could cause a catastrophic explosion. They capture the ghost and deposit it in an ecto-containment unit under the firehouse. Supernatural activity rapidly increases across the city and the Ghostbusters become famous; they hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore, to cope with the growing demand.\n\nSuspicious of the Ghostbusters, Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck asks to evaluate their equipment, but Peter rebuffs him. Egon warns that the containment unit is nearing capacity and supernatural energy is surging across the city. Peter meets with Dana and informs her Zuul was a demigod worshipped as a servant to \"Gozer the Gozerian\", a shapeshifting god of destruction. Upon returning home, she is possessed by Zuul; a similar entity possesses her neighbor, Louis Tully. Peter arrives and finds the possessed Dana/Zuul claiming to be \"the Gatekeeper\". Louis is brought to Egon by police officers and claims he is \"Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster\". The Ghostbusters agree they must keep the pair separated.\n\nPeck returns with law enforcement and city workers to have the Ghostbusters arrested and their containment unit deactivated, causing an explosion that releases the captured ghosts. Louis/Vinz escapes in the confusion and makes his way to the apartment building to join Dana/Zuul. In jail, Ray and Egon reveal that Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult in the early 20th century, designed Dana's building to function as an antenna to attract and concentrate spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about the apocalypse. Faced with supernatural chaos across the city, the Ghostbusters convince the mayor to release them.\n\nThe Ghostbusters travel to a hidden temple located on top of the building as Dana/Zuul and Louis/Vinz open the gate between dimensions and transform into demonic dogs. Gozer appears as a woman and attacks the Ghostbusters, then disappears when they attempt to retaliate. Her disembodied voice demands the Ghostbusters \"choose the form of the destructor\". Ray inadvertently recalls a beloved corporate mascot from his childhood, and Gozer reappears as a gigantic Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that begins destroying the city. Against his earlier advice, Egon instructs the team to cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional gate. The resulting explosion destroys Gozer's avatar, banishing it back to its dimension, and closes the gateway. The Ghostbusters rescue Dana and Louis from the wreckage and are welcomed on the street as heroes.\n\n## Cast\n\nStars of the film include (l-r) Bill Murray (pictured in 1989), Dan Aykroyd (1982), Sigourney Weaver (1989), Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson (both 2009), and Annie Potts (1989)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Bill Murray as Peter Venkman\n- Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz\n- Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett\n- Harold Ramis as Egon Spengler\n- Rick Moranis as Louis Tully\n- Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz\n- William Atherton as Walter Peck\n- Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore\n\nIn addition to the main cast, Ghostbusters features David Margulies as Lenny Clotch, Mayor of New York, Michael Ensign as the Sedgewick Hotel manager, and Slavitza Jovan as Gozer (voiced by Paddi Edwards). It also features astrologist Ruth Hale Oliver as the Library Ghost,[3] Alice Drummond as the Librarian,[4] Jennifer Runyon and Steven Tash as Peter's psychological test subjects,[5][6] Timothy Carhart as a violinist,[6] and Reginald VelJohnson as a corrections officer.[7] Playboy Playmate Kymberly Herrin appears as a seductive ghost in Ray's dreams.[3]\n\nRoger Grimsby, Larry King, Joe Franklin, and Casey Kasem make cameo appearances as themselves; Kasem in a voice-only role. In addition, Kasem's wife, Jean, appears as the tall guest at Louis' party; along with Debbie Gibson and porn star Ron Jeremy.[5] Director Ivan Reitman provided the voice to Slimer and other miscellaneous ghost voices.[7]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman (pictured in 1984) contributed ideas to the Ghostbusters script and helped secure its funding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGhostbusters was inspired by Dan Aykroyd's fascination with and belief in the paranormal,[1][8] which he inherited from his father, who later wrote the book A History of Ghosts;[9] his mother, who claimed to have seen ghosts; his grandfather, who experimented with radios to contact the dead; and his great-grandfather, a renowned spiritualist. In 1981, Aykroyd read an article on quantum physics and parapsychology in The Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research, which gave him the idea of trapping ghosts. He was also drawn to the idea of modernizing the comedic ghost films of the mid-20th century by comics such as Abbott and Costello (Hold That Ghost, 1941), Bob Hope (The Ghost Breakers, 1940) and the Bowery Boys (Ghost Chasers, 1951).[8][10]\n\nAykroyd wrote the script, intending to star alongside Eddie Murphy and his close friend and fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) alumnus John Belushi, before Belushi's accidental death in March 1982.[1][8] Aykroyd recalled writing one of Belushi's lines when producer and talent agent Bernie Brillstein called to inform him of Belushi's death.[8] He turned to another former SNL castmate, Bill Murray, who agreed to join without an explicit agreement, which is how he often worked.[8] Aykroyd pitched his concept to Brillstein as three men who chase ghosts and included a sketch of the Marshmallow Man character he had imagined. He likened the Ghostbusters to pest-control workers, saying that \"calling a Ghostbuster was just like getting rats removed\".[10] Aykroyd believed Ivan Reitman was the logical choice to direct, based on his successes with films such as Animal House (1978) and Stripes (1981).[8] Reitman was aware of the film's outline while Belushi was still a prospective cast member; this version took place in the future with many groups of intergalactic ghostbusters, and felt it \"would have cost something like $200 million to make\".[10][b] Aykroyd's original 70- to 80-page script treatment was more serious in tone and intended to be scary.[8][10]\n\nReitman met with Aykroyd at Art's Delicatessen in Studio City, Los Angeles, and explained that his concept would be impossible to make. He suggested that setting it entirely on Earth would make the extraordinary elements funnier, and that focusing on realism from the beginning would make the Marshmallow Man more believable by the end. He also wanted to portray the Ghostbusters' origins before starting their business: \"This was beginning of the 1980s—everyone was going into business\".[8][10] After the meeting, they met Harold Ramis at Burbank Studios. Reitman had worked with Ramis on previous films and believed he could better execute the tone he intended for the script than Aykroyd.[10] He also felt Ramis should play a Ghostbuster. After reading the script, Ramis joined the project immediately.[8]\n\nAlthough the script required considerable changes, Reitman pitched the film to Columbia Pictures executive Frank Price in March 1983. Price found the concept funny, but was unsure of the project, as comedies were seen to have limited profitability. He said the film would take a big budget due to its special effects and popular cast.[8][10] Reitman reportedly said they could work with $25–30 million;[c] varying figures have been cited. Price agreed, as long as the film could be released by June 1984.[8][9] Reitman later admitted he made up the figure, basing it on three times the budget for Stripes, which seemed \"reasonable\".[8] This left 13 months to complete the film, with no finished script, effects studio, or filming start date.[9] Reitman hired his previous collaborators Joe Medjuck and Michael C. Gross as associate producers.[11] Columbia's CEO Fay Vincent sent his lawyer Dick Gallop to Los Angeles to convince Price not to pursue the film, but Price disagreed. Gallop returned to the head office to report that Price was \"out of control\".[8][10]\n\nAs the title \"Ghostbusters\" was legally restricted by the 1970s children's show The Ghost Busters, owned by Universal Studios, several alternative titles were considered, including \"Ghoststoppers\", \"Ghostbreakers\", and \"Ghostsmashers\".[8][12][13] Price parted ways with Columbia early in Ghostbusters' production and became head of Universal Pictures, at which point he sold Columbia the title for $500,000 plus 1% of the film's profits. Given Hollywood's accounting practices—used by studios to artificially inflate a film's production costs to limit royalty or tax payouts—the film technically never made a profit for Universal to be owed a payment.[10][12][14]\n\n### Writing\n\nAykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman began reworking the script, first at Reitman's office, then sequestering themselves and their families on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Aykroyd had a home there, and they worked day and night in his basement for about two weeks.[9] Aykroyd was willing to rework his script; he considered himself a \"kitchen sink\" writer who created the funny situations and paranormal jargon, while Ramis refined the jokes and dialogue. They wrote separately, then rewrote each other's drafts. Many scenes had to be cut, including an asylum haunted by celebrities, and an illegal ghost-storage facility in a New Jersey gas station.[8] Their initial draft was completed when they left the Vineyard in mid-July 1983, and a third and near-final draft was ready by early August.[8][9][15] When Murray flew to New York after filming The Razor's Edge (1984) to meet Aykroyd and Ramis, he offered little input on the script or his character. Having written for Murray multiple times, Ramis said he knew \"how to handle his character's voice\".[8]\n\nIt was decided early on that Ramis's character would be the brains of the Ghostbusters, Aykroyd's the heart, and Murray's the mouth.[10] Aykroyd drew inspiration from fiction archetypes: \"Put Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler together, and you have the Scarecrow, the Lion, and the Tin Man\".[8] His concept called for the Ghostbusters to have a boss and to be directed into situations, but Ramis preferred they be in control \"of their own destiny\" and make their own choices. This led to the development of more distinct identities for the characters: Peter as the cool, modern salesman; Ray as the honest, enthusiastic technician; and Egon as the factual, stoic intellectual.[11]\n\nReitman thought the most difficult parts of the writing were determining the story's goal, who the villain was and their goal, why ghosts were manifesting, and how a towering Marshmallow Man would appear. The creature was one of many elaborate supernatural entities in Aykroyd's initial treatment, originally intended to emerge from the East River only 20 minutes into the film. It stood out to Reitman but concerned him because of the relatively realistic tone they were taking. Meanwhile, Reitman searched for a special effects studio, eventually recruiting Richard Edlund in the same two-week span.[9][16]\n\n### Cast and characters\n\nWilliam Atherton (in 2009) portrays Environmental Protection Agency inspector Walter Peck.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMurray was considered essential to Ghostbusters' potential success, but he was known for not committing to projects until late. Price agreed to fund Murray's passion project The Razor's Edge, believing if it failed it would lose little money, and hoping the gesture would secure Murray's commitment to Ghostbusters.[8] Michael Keaton, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Steve Guttenberg, and Richard Pryor were also considered for the role.[1][17][18] Christopher Walken, John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum, and Keaton were considered to portray Egon.[18][19] Ramis was inspired by the cover of a journal on abstract architecture for Egon's appearance, featuring a man wearing a three-piece tweed suit and wire-rim glasses, his hair standing straight up. He took the character's first name from a Hungarian refugee with whom he attended school, and the surname from German historian Oswald Spengler.[10] Apart from the three main stars, Medjuck was largely responsible for casting the roles.[20]\n\nHudson auditioned five times for the role of Winston Zeddemore.[8] According to him, an earlier version of the script gave Winston a larger role as an Air Force demolitions expert with an elaborate backstory. Excited by the part, he agreed to the job for half his usual salary. The night before shooting began, he received a new script with a greatly reduced role; Reitman told him the studio wanted to expand Murray's part.[21] Aykroyd said Winston was the role intended for Eddie Murphy, although Reitman denied this.[3][22] Gregory Hines and Reginald VelJohnson were also considered for the part.[23][24]\n\nDaryl Hannah, Denise Crosby, Julia Roberts, and Kelly LeBrock auditioned for the role of Dana Barrett, but Sigourney Weaver attracted the filmmakers' attention. There was resistance to casting her because of the generally serious roles she had played in Alien (1979) and The Year of Living Dangerously (1982). She revealed her comedic background, developed at the Yale School of Drama, and began walking on all fours and howling like a dog during her audition.[d] It was her suggestion for Dana to become possessed by Zuul; Reitman said this solved problems with the last act by giving the characters personal stakes in the events.[9] Weaver also changed Dana's occupation from a model to a musician, saying that Dana can be somewhat strict, but has a soul because she plays the cello.[8]\n\nJohn Candy was offered the role of Louis Tully. He told Reitman he did not understand the character and suggested portraying Tully with a German accent and multiple German Shepherds, but the filmmakers felt there were already enough dogs in the film. Candy chose not to pursue the role. Reitman had previously worked with Rick Moranis and sent him the script; he accepted the role an hour later.[9][10][15] Moranis developed many aspects of his character, including making him an accountant, and ad-libbed the lengthy speech at Tully's party.[15] Sandra Bernhard turned down the role of the Ghostbusters' secretary Janine Melnitz, which went to Annie Potts. When she arrived for her first day of filming, Reitman rushed Potts into the current scene. She quickly changed out of her street clothes and borrowed a pair of glasses worn by the set dresser which her character subsequently wore throughout the film.[27][10]\n\nWilliam Atherton was chosen for the role of Walter Peck after he had appeared in the Broadway play Broadway. Peck was described as akin to Margaret Dumont's role as a comedic foil to the Marx Brothers. Atherton said: \"It can't be funny, and I don't find [the Ghostbusters] in the least bit charming. I have to be outraged.\"[28] The role of the Sumerian god Gozer the Gozerian, envisioned as a business-suited architect, was originally intended for Paul Reubens. When he passed on the idea, Yugoslavian actress Slavitza Jovan was cast and the character changed to one inspired by the androgynous looks of Grace Jones and David Bowie.[27][29][30] Paddi Edwards was uncredited as the voice of Gozer, dubbing over Jovan's strong Slavic accent.[1][31] Reitman's wife and their children, Jason and Catherine, filmed a cameo appearance as a family fleeing Dana's building, but the scene was cut because Jason was too scared by the setup to perform a second take.[32]\n\n### Filming\n\n55 Central Park West (in 2007), which served as the setting for the climactic battle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography began in New York City on October 28, 1983.[1][8][33] On the first day, Reitman brought Murray to the set, still unsure if he had read the script.[8] Filming in New York lasted for approximately six weeks, finishing just before Christmas.[9] Reitman was conscious they had to complete the New York phase before they encountered inhospitable December weather.[34] At the time, choosing to shoot in New York City was considered risky. In the early 1980s, many saw the city as synonymous with fiscal disaster and violence, and Los Angeles was seen as the center of the entertainment industry. In a 2014 interview, Reitman said he chose New York because \"I wanted the film to be ... my New York movie\".[8] As Reitman was working with comedians, he encouraged improvisation, adapting multiple takes and keeping the cast creations that worked, but directing them back to the script.[15]\n\nSome guerrilla filmmaking took place, capturing spontaneous scenes at iconic locations around the city, including one shot at Rockefeller Center where the actors were chased off by a real security guard.[8] A scene was shot on Central Park West with extras chanting \"Ghostbusters\" before the name had been cleared. Medjuck contacted the studio, urging them to secure permission to use the word as the title.[10]\n\nThe building at 55 Central Park West served as the home of Weaver's character and the setting of the Ghostbusters' climactic battle with Gozer. The art department added extra floors and embellishments using matte paintings, models, and digital effects to create the focal point of ghostly activity.[7][35][36] During shooting of the final scene at the building, city officials allowed the closure of the adjacent streets during rush hour, affecting traffic across a large swath of the city. Gross commented that, from the top of the building, they could see traffic queuing all the way to Brooklyn. At various points, a police officer drew his gun on a taxi driver who refused orders; in a similar incident, another officer pulled a driver through his limo window. When angry citizens asked Medjuck what was being filmed, he blamed Francis Ford Coppola filming The Cotton Club (1984). Aykroyd encountered science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, a man he admired, who complained, \"You guys are inconveniencing this building, it's just awful; I don't know how they got away with this!\"[10] Directly next to 55 Central Park West is the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, which is stepped on by the Marshmallow Man.[36]\n\nFirehouse, Hook &amp; Ladder Company 8 (in 2020), the New York City firehouse used for the exterior of the Ghostbusters headquarters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther locations included New York City Hall,[36] the New York Public Library main branch,[1] the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts,[37] Columbus Circle, the Irving Trust Bank on Fifth Avenue,[38] and Tavern on the Green. Firehouse, Hook &amp; Ladder Company 8 in the Tribeca neighborhood was used as the Ghostbusters' headquarters.[1][3][39] Columbia University allowed its Havemeyer Hall to stand in for the fictional Weaver Hall, on the condition the university not be identified by name.[39]\n\nFilming moved to Los Angeles, resuming between Christmas and the New Year.[9] Due to the film's use of practical effects, skilled technicians were needed who resided mainly in the city and soundstages that were non-existent in New York.[34] Despite its setting, most of Ghostbusters was filmed on location in Los Angeles or on sets at Burbank Studios. Location scouts searched for buildings that could replicate the interiors of buildings being filmed in New York.[1][34] Reitman tried using the interior of Hook &amp; Ladder 8, but was unable to take it over long enough because it was an active fire station. Interior firehouse shots were taken instead at the decommissioned Fire House No. 23 in downtown Los Angeles. The building design, while common in New York, was a rarity in Los Angeles. An archival photograph of an active crew in Fire House No. 23 from 1915 was hung in the background of the Ghostbusters' office.[34]\n\nFilming in the main reading room of the New York Public Library was only allowed in the early morning and had to be concluded by 10:00 am.[16] The basement library stacks were represented by the Los Angeles Central Library as Reitman said they were interchangeable.[34] The Millennium Biltmore Hotel stood in for the scenes set at the fictional Sedgewick Hotel.[40] Principal photography concluded at the end of January 1984, after between 55 and 62 days of filming.[9][41]\n\n### Post-production\n\nThe short production schedule and looming release date meant Reitman edited the film while it was being shot. There was often only time for a few takes.[9][16] Reitman sometimes found making an effects-laden movie frustrating, as the special effects had to be storyboarded and filmed in advance; there was no option to go back and produce new scenes. As Gross described it: \"[Y]ou storyboard in advance, that's like editing in advance. You've got a scene, they're going to approve that scene, and we're going to spend nine months doing that cut. There's no second takes, no outtakes, there's no coverage. You can cut stuff, but you can't add stuff. It made [Reitman] so confined that it really bothered him\".[41]\n\nA deleted scene involved a segment at \"Fort Detmerring\" where Ray has a sexual encounter with a female ghost. The scene was intended to introduce a love interest for Aykroyd. Ramis believed it was extraneous to the fast-moving plot, however, so Reitman used the footage as a dream sequence during the mid-film montage instead.[42] Editor Sheldon Kahn sent Reitman black-and-white reels of sequences during filming. They not only allowed him to make changes, but he considered they also helped him understand how to better pace the film. Kahn completed the first full cut three weeks after filming concluded.[9] The final cut runs for 105 minutes.[1]\n\n### Music\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Ghostbusters score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the 72-person Hollywood Studio Symphony orchestra at The Village in West Los Angeles, California. It was orchestrated by David Spear and Bernstein's son Peter.[43][44] Elmer Bernstein had previously scored several of Reitman's films and joined the project early on, before all the cast had been signed.[43] Reitman wanted a grounded, realistic score and did not want the music to tell the audience when something was funny.[41] Bernstein used the ondes Martenot (effectively a keyboard equivalent of a theremin) to produce the \"eerie\" effect. Bernstein had to bring a musician from England to play the instrument because there were so few trained ondists. He also used three Yamaha DX7 synthesizers.[43][44] In a 1985 interview Bernstein described Ghostbusters as the most difficult score he had written, finding it challenging to balance the varying comedic and serious tones. He created an \"antic\" theme for the Ghostbusters he described as \"cute, without being really way out\". He found the latter parts of the film easier to score, aiming to make it sound \"awesome and mystical\".[43]\n\nEarly on Reitman and Bernstein discussed the idea that Ghostbusters would feature popular music at specific points to complement Bernstein's original score. This includes \"Magic\" by Mick Smiley, which plays during the scene when the ghosts are released from the Ghostbusters headquarters. Bernstein's main theme for the Ghostbusters was later replaced by Ray Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\".[43][44] Bernstein personally disliked the use of these songs, particularly \"Magic\", but said, \"it's very hard to argue with something like [\"Ghostbusters\"], when it is up in the top ten on the charts\".[43]\n\nMusic was required for a montage in the middle of the film, and \"I Want a New Drug\" by Huey Lewis and the News was used as a temporary placeholder because of its appropriate tempo. Reitman was later introduced to Parker Jr. who developed \"Ghostbusters\" with a similar riff to match the montage.[10] There were approximately 50 to 60 different theme songs developed for Ghostbusters by different artists before Parker Jr.'s involvement, though none was deemed suitable.[45][46] Huey Lewis was approached to compose the film's theme, but was already committed to work on Back to the Future (1985).[1]\n\n## Design\n\nDuring the thirteen-month production, all the major special effects studios were working on other films. Those that remained were too small to work on the approximately 630 individual effects shots needed for Ghostbusters. At the same time, special effects cinematographer Richard Edlund planned to leave Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and start his own business. Reitman convinced Columbia to collaborate with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which also needed an effects studio, to advance Edlund $5 million to establish his own company, Boss Film Studios.[8][9] According to Edlund, lawyers used much of the setup time finalizing the contract, leaving only ten months remaining to build the effects studio, shoot the scenes, and composite the images.[8] The Boss Film Studios' team was split to complete work on Ghostbusters and MGM's science-fiction film 2010: The Year We Make Contact.[1] The $5 million effects came in at $700,000 over budget.[16] The strict filming schedule meant most of the effects shots were captured in one take.[41] Gross oversaw both the creation of Boss Film Studios, and the hiring of many conceptual designers including comic book artists Tanino Liberatore (whose work went unused) and Bernie Wrightson (who helped conceive several ghost designs), and storyboarder Thom Enriquez, whose designs contributed to the \"Onion Head ghost\".[20]\n\n### Creature effects\n\nSteve Johnson created the final design for the \"Onion Head ghost\", later named \"Slimer\".\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEdlund's previous work on the supernatural horror film Poltergeist (1982) served as a reference for the ghost designs in Ghostbusters. Gross said it was difficult to balance making the ghosts a genuine threat while fitting the film's more comedic tone.[47][48] Special effects artist Steve Johnson sculpted the gluttonous, slimy, green ghost then known as the \"Onion Head ghost\" on set due to the puppet's unpleasant smell.[13][49] The creature was given the name \"Slimer\" in the 1986 animated television series The Real Ghostbusters.[1] The Slimer design took six months and cost approximately $300,000. After struggling to complete a design due to executive interference, Johnson took at least three grams of cocaine and completed the final design in one night, based in part on Aykroyd's and Ramis's wish for the creature to homage Belushi.[e] The full-size foam rubber puppet was worn by Mark Wilson and filmed against a black background. Puppeteers manipulated the model's movements with cables.[1][50][51]\n\nAykroyd tasked his friend, referred to as the Viking, with designing the Marshmallow Man, asking for a combination of the Michelin Man and the Pillsbury Doughboy in a sailor hat.[10] The Marshmallow Man outfit was built and portrayed by actor and special effects artist Bill Bryan, who modeled his walk on Godzilla. There were eighteen foam suits, each costing between $25,000 and $30,000; seventeen of them, worn by stuntman Tommy Cesar, were burned as part of filming.[16][52] Bryan used a separate air supply due to the foam's toxicity. There were three different heads for the suit, built from foam and fiberglass, with different expressions and movements controlled by cable mechanisms. The costume was filmed against scale models to finish the effect. The effects team was able to find only one model of a police car at the correct scale and bought several, modifying them to represent different vehicles. The water from a burst hydrant hit by a remote-controlled car was actually sand as the water did not scale down.[16][53][54] The \"marshmallow\" raining down on the crowd after it is destroyed was shaving cream. After seeing the intended 150 pounds (68 kg) of shaving cream to be used, Atherton insisted on testing it. The weight knocked a stuntman down, and they ended up using only 75 pounds (34 kg). The cream acted as a skin irritant after hours of filming, giving some of the cast rashes.[10]\n\nJohnson also sculpted the Zombie Cab Driver puppet.[55] It was the only puppet shot on location in New York City. Johnson based it on a reanimated corpse puppet he had made for An American Werewolf in London (1981).[55] Johnson and Wilson collaborated on the Library Ghost, creating a puppet operated by up to 20 cables running through the torso that controlled aspects such as moving the head, arms, and pulling rubber skin away from the torso to transform it from a humanoid into a monstrous ghoul.[56] The original Library Ghost puppet was considered too scary for younger audiences and was repurposed for use in Fright Night (1985).[5] The library catalog scene was accomplished live in three takes, with the crew blowing air through copper pipes to force the cards into the air. These had to be collected and reassembled for each take. Reitman used a multi-camera setup to focus on the librarian and the cards flying around her and a wider overall shot.[9][16] The floating books were hung on strings.[16]\n\nRandy Cook was responsible for creating the quarter-scale stop-motion puppets of Gozer's minions Zuul and Vinz, the Terror Dogs, when in motion. The model was heavy and unwieldy, and it took nearly thirty hours to film it moving across a 30-foot (9.1 m) stage for the scene where it pursues Louis Tully across a street.[56] For the scene where Dana is pinned to her chair by demonic hands before a doorway beaming with light, Reitman said he was influenced by Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). A rubber door was used to allow distortion as if something was trying to come through it, while grips concealed in a trapdoor beneath the chair, burst through it while wearing demonic dog-leg gloves.[16] Made before the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI), any non-puppet ghosts had to be animated. It took up to three weeks to create one second of footage.[16] For Gozer, Slavitza Jovan wore red contact lenses that caused her a great deal of pain, and she wore a harness to move around the set.[7]\n\n### Technology and equipment\n\nHardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for designing most of the Ghostbusters' iconic equipment, including the \"proton packs\" used to wrangle ghosts, ghost traps, and their vehicle, the Ectomobile. The equipment had to be designed and built in the six weeks before filming began in September 1983.[33][57] Inspired by a military issue flamethrower, the \"proton packs\" consisted of a handheld proton stream firing \"neutrino wand\" connected by a hose to a backpack said to contain a nuclear accelerator.[12][58] Dane said he \"went home and got foam pieces and just threw a bunch of stuff together to get the look. It was highly machined, but it had to look off-the-shelf and military surplus\".[59]\n\nFollowing Reitman's tweaks to the design, on-screen models of the \"proton packs\" were made from a fiberglass shell with an aluminum backplate bolted to a United States Army backpack frame.[58] Each pack weighed approximately 30 pounds (14 kg) with the batteries for lighting installed, and strained the actors' backs during the long shoots.[16][59] Two lighter versions were made; a hollow one with surface details for wide shots, and a foam rubber version for action scenes.[16][58] The fiberglass props were created by special effects supervisor Chuck Gaspar, based on Dane's design. Gaspar used rubber molds to create identical fiberglass shells.[59] The \"neutrino wand\" had a flashbulb at the tip, giving animators an origin point for the proton streams.[16] Fake walls laced with pyrotechnics were used to practically create the damage of the proton streams.[34] The \"Psychokinetic Energy meter\" (\"PKE meter\") prop was built using an Iona SP-1 handheld shoe polisher as a base, to which lights and electronics were affixed.[60] The PKE meter prop was designed and built by John Zabrucky of Modern Props in partnership with an outside fabricator.[61] The technology was designed to not be overly fancy or sleek, emphasizing the characters' scientific backgrounds combined with the homemade nature of their equipment.[34]\n\nThe Ectomobile was in the first draft of Aykroyd's script, and he and John Daveikis developed some early concepts for the car. Dane developed fully detailed drawings for the interior and exterior and supervised the transformation of the 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor ambulance conversion into the Ectomobile.[62] According to Aykroyd, the actual vehicle was \"an ambulance that we converted to a hearse and then converted to an ambulance\".[63] Early concepts featured a black car with purple and white strobe lights giving it a supernatural glow, but this idea was scrapped after cinematographer László Kovács noted that dark paint would not film well at night. The concept also had fantastic features such as the ability to dematerialize and travel inter-dimensionally. Two vehicles were purchased, one for the pre-modification scenes.[62] Dane designed its high-tech roof array with objects including a directional antenna, an air-conditioning unit, storage boxes and a radome.[64] Because of its size, the roof rack was shipped to Manhattan on an airplane, while the car was transported to the East Coast by train.[33] Sound designer Richard Beggs created the siren from a recording of a leopard snarl, cut and played backward.[64]\n\n### Logo and sets\n\nThe alternative \"correct\" design of the \"no ghosts\" logo features a diagonal bar that runs top-left to bottom-right.[65]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the script, Aykroyd described the Ghostbusters clothing and vehicle as bearing a no symbol with a ghost trapped in it, crediting the Viking with the original concept.[65][66] The final design fell to Gross, who had volunteered to serve as art director. As the logo would be required for props and sets, it needed to be finalized quickly, and Gross worked with Boss Film artist and creature design consultant Brent Boates who drew the final concept, and R/GA animated the logo for the film's opening. According to Gross, two versions of the logo exist, with one having \"ghostbusters\" written across the diagonal part of the sign. Gross did not like how it looked and flipped the diagonal bar to read top left to bottom right instead, but they later removed the wording. According to Gross, this is the correct version of the sign that was used throughout Europe. The bottom left to top right version was used in the United States as that was the design of the No symbol there.[65]\n\nMedjuck also hired John DeCuir as production designer.[15] The script did not specify where Gozer would appear, and DeCuir painted the top of Dana's building with large, crystal doors that opened as written in the script.[15] The fictional rooftop of 55 Central Park West was constructed at Stage 12 on the Burbank Studios lot. It was one of the largest constructed sets in film history and was surrounded by a 360-degree cyclorama painting. The lighting used throughout the painting consumed so much power that the rest of the studio had to be shut down, and an additional four generators added, when it was in use.[9][34][67] Small models such as planes were hung on string to animate the backdrop.[9] The set was built three stories off the ground to allow for filming from low angles.[16]\n\nThe first three floors and street-front of Dana's building were recreated as sets for filming, including the climactic earthquake scene where hydraulics were used to raise broken parts of the street.[7][68] Broken pieces of pavement and the road were positioned outside the real location to create a seamless transition between the two shots.[34] DeCuir said: \"They had one night to dress the street. When people went home early in the evening everything was normal, and when the little old ladies came out to walk their dogs in the morning, the whole street had erupted. Apparently, people complained to the New York Police Department and their switchboard lit up.\"[69] For the scene where Dana's apartment explodes outwards, Weaver stood on set as the stunt happened.[16] Similarly, the scene of Weaver rotating in the air was performed on set using a body-cast and mechanical arm concealed in the curtains, a trick Reitman learned working with magician Doug Henning.[7]\n\n## Release\n\n### Test screening and marketing\n\nGhostbusters was screened for test audiences on February 3, 1984, with unfinished effects shots to determine if the comedy worked. Reitman was still concerned audiences would not react well to the Marshmallow Man because of its deviation from the realism of the rest of the film.[15] Reitman recalled that approximately 200 people were recruited off the streets to view the film in a theater on the Burbank lot. It was during the opening library scene Reitman knew the film worked. Audiences reacted with fear, laughs, and applause as the Librarian Ghost transformed into a monster.[15] The fateful Marshmallow scene was met with a similar reaction, and Reitman knew he would not have to perform any re-shoots.[9][15] The screening for fellow industry members fared less well. Price recalled laughing as the rest of the audience sat deadpan; he rationalized an industry audience wants failure. Murray and Aykroyd's agent Michael Ovitz recalled an executive telling him, \"Don't worry: we all make mistakes\", while Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Columbia's parent, The Coca-Cola Company, said: \"Gee, we're going to lose our shirts\".[8][70]\n\n| External videos                                                          | External videos                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ghostbusters promotional film for Showest 1984 Bill Murray &amp; Dan Aykroyd | Ghostbusters promotional film for Showest 1984 Bill Murray &amp; Dan Aykroyd |\n\nIn the months before its debut, a teaser trailer focused on the \"No ghosts\" logo, helping it become recognizable far in advance, and generating interest in the film without mentioning its title or its stars.[1][71] A separate theatrical trailer contained a toll-free telephone number with a message by Murray and Aykroyd waiting for the 1,000 callers per hour it received over a six-week period.[13] They also appeared in a video for ShoWest, a theater-owner convention, to promote the film.[72] Columbia spent approximately $10 million on marketing, including $2.25 million on prints, $1 million on promotional materials, and $7 million on advertising and miscellaneous costs including a $150,000 premiere for a hospital and the hotel costs for the press.[73] Including the budget and marketing costs, it was estimated the film would have to make at least $80 million to turn a profit.[47]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe premiere of Ghostbusters took place on June 7, 1984, at the Avco Cinema in Westwood, Los Angeles, before its wide release the following day across 1,339 theaters in the United States (U.S.) and Canada.[1][74] During its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, the film earned $13.6 million—an average of $10,040 per theater.[f] It finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of premiering horror-comedy Gremlins ($12.5 million), and the adventure film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ($12 million), in its third week of release.[74][75] The gross increased to $23.1 million during its first week,[g] becoming the first major success for the studio since Tootsie (1982).[h] The film remained number one for seven consecutive weeks, grossing $146.5 million, before being ousted by Purple Rain in early August.[78][79][80]\n\nGhostbusters regained the number one spot the following week before spending the next five weeks at number two, behind the action film Red Dawn and then the thriller Tightrope.[81][82][83] Ghostbusters remained among the top-three grossing films for sixteen straight weeks before beginning a gradual decline and falling from the top-ten by late October. It left cinemas in early January 1985, after thirty weeks.[76][84] Ghostbusters had quickly become a hit, surpassing Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as the top-grossing film of the summer, and earning $229 million,[i] making it the second highest-grossing film of 1984, approximately $5 million behind Eddie Murphy's action-comedy Beverly Hills Cop ($234.8 million) which was released in mid-December.[15][85] Ghostbusters surpassed Animal House as the highest-grossing comedy film ever, until Beverly Hills Cop surpassed it six months later.[9][84][85]\n\nColumbia had negotiated 50% of the box-office revenues or 90% of gross after expenses, depending on whichever was higher. Since the latter was the case, the studio received a 73% share of the box office profit, an estimated $128 million.[73][j] The main cast members each received percentages of the gross profits or net participation.[1] A 1987 report estimated Murray alone had earned between $20–30 million from his share.[86][k] 1984 saw the release of several films that would later be considered iconic of the era, including: Gremlins, The Karate Kid, The Terminator, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Romancing the Stone, and The NeverEnding Story. It was also the first year in box office history in which four films, including Ghostbusters, grossed over $100 million.[87]\n\nGhostbusters was re-released in the U.S. and Canada in August 1985, grossing a further $9.4 million over five weeks, raising its theatrical gross to $238.6 million[88][89] and surpassing Beverly Hills Cop as the most successful comedy of the 1980s.[85] By the end of 1999, Ghostbusters had grossed $126 million internationally for a worldwide total of $364.6 million.[90] A restored and remastered version was released in August 2014, at 700 theaters across the U.S. and Canada to celebrate its 30th anniversary. It grossed an additional $3.5 million, bringing the theatrical total to $242.2 million.[91][92] The film has also received limited rereleases for special events and anniversaries.[93][94] Including all reissues since 2000, the film has grossed an estimated $370 million worldwide.[90] Adjusted for inflation, the North American box office is equivalent to $667.9 million in 2020, making it the thirty-seventh highest-grossing film ever.[95]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nBill Murray in 2018. Critics were consistent in their praise of his comedic deadpan performance as the main highlight of Ghostbusters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGhostbusters opened to generally positive reviews.[1][96] Roger Ebert gave it three and a half out of four, citing it as a rare example of successfully combining a special effects-driven blockbuster with \"sly\" dialogue. Ebert noted the effects existed to serve the actors' performances and not the reverse, saying it is \"an exception to the general rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy\". He also cited Ghostbusters as a rare mainstream film with many quotable lines.[97] Writing for Newsday, Joseph Gelmis described the Ghostbusters as an adolescent fantasy, comparing their firehouse base to the Batcave with a fireman's pole and an Ectomobile on the ground floor.[98]\n\nDeseret News' Christopher Hicks praised Reitman's improved directing skills, and the crew for avoiding the vulgarity found in their previous films, Caddyshack and Stripes. He felt they reached for more creative humor and genuine thrills instead. He complained about the finale, claiming it lost its sense of fun and was \"overblown\", but found the film compensated for this since it \"has ghosts like you've never seen\".[99] Janet Maslin agreed that the apocalyptic finale was out of hand, saying Ghostbusters worked best during the smaller ghost-catching scenes.[100] Dave Kehr wrote that Reitman is adept at improvisational comedy, but lost control of the film as the special effects gradually escalated.[101]\n\nArthur Knight appreciated the relaxed style of comedy saying while the plot is \"primitive\", it has \"far more style and finesse\" than would be expected of the creative team behind Meatballs and Animal House. He singled out editors Sheldon Kahn and David Blewitt for creating a sustained pace of comedy and action.[102] Despite \"bathroom humor and tacky sight gags\", Peter Travers described Ghostbusters favorably as \"irresistible nonsense\", comparing it to the supernatural horror film The Exorcist, but with the comedy duo Abbott and Costello starring.[103] Time's Richard Schickel described the special effects as somewhat \"tacky\" but believed this was a deliberate commentary on other ghost films. Ultimately, he believed praise was due to all involved for \"thinking on a grandly comic scale\".[104][105] Newsweek's David Ansen enjoyed the film, describing it as a teamwork project where everyone works \"toward the same goal of relaxed insanity\"; he called it \"wonderful summer nonsense\".[106] Variety's review described it as a \"lavishly produced\" film that is only periodically impressive.[107]\n\nReviewers were consistent in their praise for Murray's performance.[l] Gene Siskel wrote that Murray's comedic sensibilities compensated for the \"boring special effects\".[108] Variety singled out Murray for his \"endearing\" physical comedy and ad-libbing.[107] Hicks similarly praised Murray, saying he \"has never been better than he is here\".[99] Schickel considered Murray's character a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop fully his patented comic character\".[104][105] Gelmis appreciated Murray's dismissal of the serious situations to keep them comedic.[98]\n\nThe interactions between Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis, were also generally well received.[103][108] Schickel praised Aykroyd and Ramis for their \"grace\" in allowing Murray to outshine them.[104][105] Travers and Gelmis said the three main actors worked well as a collaborative force,[98][103] and Hicks described Murray, Ramis, and Aykroyd as wanting \"to be like the Marx Brothers of the 80s\".[99] Conversely, Kehr believed the pair were \"curiously underutilized\", but appreciated Murray's deadpan line readings.[101] The New Yorker's Pauline Kael had problems with the chemistry among the three leads. She praised Murray, but felt other actors did not have much material to contribute to the story; she concluded, \"Murray's lines fall on dead air\".[109] Maslin believed Murray's talents were in service to a film lacking wit or coherence. She noted that many of the characters had little to do, leaving their stories unresolved as the plot began to give way to servicing the special effects instead. However, she did praise Weaver's performance as an \"excellent foil\" for Murray.[100] Variety described it as a mistake to cast top comedians but often have them working alone.[107] Siskel enjoyed the characters interacting with each other, but was critical of Hudson's late addition to the plot and his lack of development, believing it made \"him appear as only a token box office lure\".[108]\n\n### Accolades\n\nGhostbusters was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1985: Best Original Song for \"Ghostbusters\" by Ray Parker Jr. (losing to Stevie Wonder's \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" from The Woman in Red), and Best Visual Effects for John Bruno, Richard Edlund, Chuck Gaspar and Mark Vargo (losing to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).[12][110] That year, it was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy (losing to Romancing the Stone),[111] Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Murray (losing to Dudley Moore in Micki &amp; Maude),[112] and Best Original Song for Parker Jr., (losing again to \"I Just Called to Say I Love You\").[113] \"Ghostbusters\" went on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Original Song, and Edlund was nominated for Special Visual Effects (losing again to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).[114] It won Best Fantasy Film at the 12th Saturn Awards.[115]\n\n## Post-release\n\n### Aftermath\n\nRay Parker Jr. in 1984\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRay Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1984 and 21 weeks on the charts altogether.[45][116] The song is estimated to have added $20 million to the film's box office.[117] Reitman directed the successful \"Ghostbusters\" music video that included several celebrity cameos.[1][45][46] Shortly after the film's release, Huey Lewis sued Parker Jr., for plagiarizing his 1983 song \"I Want a New Drug\";[1][46] the case was settled out of court in 1985.[10][46] Parker Jr. later sued Lewis for breaching a confidentiality agreement about the case.[46] In 1984, the filmmakers were also sued by Harvey Cartoons, the owner of Casper the Friendly Ghost for $50 million and the destruction of all copies of the film. Harvey alleged the Ghostbusters logo was based on their character Fatso. The case was decided in Columbia's favor.[118][119]\n\nMurray left acting for four years following the release of Ghostbusters. He described the success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and, compounded by the failure of his personal project The Razor's Edge, he felt \"radioactive\". Murray avoided central roles in films until the 1988 Christmas comedy film Scrooged,[120][121] which used the tagline that Murray was \"back among the ghosts\".[66][122] In a 1989 interview, Reitman said he was upset at the \"little respect\" he felt Ghostbusters received and his work was not taken seriously, believing many dismissed it as just \"another action-comedy\".[121]\n\nHudson held mixed feelings about Ghostbusters. He regretted the marginalization of his character from the original script and felt Ghostbusters did not improve his career as he had hoped, or been promised. In a 2014 interview, he said: \"I love the character and he's got some great lines, but I felt the guy was just kind of there ... I'm very thankful that fans appreciate the Winston character. But it's always been very frustrating—kind of a love/hate thing, I guess.\"[21] Atherton said fans would call him \"dickless\" on the streets into the 1990s, to his ire.[7][27]\n\n### Home media\n\nGhostbusters was released on VHS in October 1985. Paramount Pictures had scheduled the equally popular Beverly Hills Cop to release the day before Ghostbusters, forcing Columbia to release it a week earlier to avoid direct competition. Priced at $79.95, Ghostbusters was predicted to sell well but be outperformed by Beverly Hills Cop because of its lower $29.95 price.[m] The release was supported by a $1 million advertising campaign. The film was the tenth best-selling videocassette during its launch week. Columbia earned approximately $20 million selling the video manufacturing and distribution rights.[123][124][125] A record 410,000 cassettes were ordered (exceeded a few months later by Rambo: First Blood Part II's 425,000 unit order). By February 1986, it was estimated to have sold 400,000 copies and earned $32 million in revenue, making it the third best-selling VHS of 1985, after Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (425,000 units, $12.7 million) and Beverly Hills Cop (1.4 million units sold, $41.9 million).[126][127]\n\nGhostbusters was released in 1989 on LaserDisc, a format then experiencing a resurgence in popularity. The release offered a one-disc version, and a two-disc special edition version featuring deleted scenes, a split-screen demonstration of the film's effects, the screenplay, and other special features. In a 1999 interview for the DVD release, Reitman admitted he was not involved in the LaserDisc versions and had been embarrassed by the visual changes that \"pumped up the light level so much you saw all the matte lines\", highlighting flaws in the special effects.[128][129][130] Ghostbusters was also the first full-length film to be released on a USB flash drive when PNY Technologies did so in 2008.[131]\n\nBlu-ray disc editions were released for the film's 25th, 30th, and 35th anniversaries in 2009, 2014 and 2019. They featured remastered 4K resolution video quality, deleted scenes, alternate takes, fan interviews, and commentaries by crew members and actors including Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Medjuck. The 35th-anniversary version came in a limited edition steel book cover and contained unseen footage including the deleted \"Fort Detmerring\" scene.[132][133][134] The film was released as part of the 8-disc Ghostbusters: Ultimate Collection Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray boxset in February 2022, also containing its sequels Ghostbusters II (1989) and Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), and the 2016 reboot Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. Presented in a ghost trap-shaped box, the release features a 114-minute preview cut of Ghostbusters including deleted scenes, an edited-for-TV version, recorded auditions for Dana, and a 90-minute documentary, \"Ghostbusters: Behind Closed Doors\" about the film's production.[26][135] Parker Jr.'s \"Ghostbusters\" received special edition vinyl record releases, one as a glow in the dark record—the other a white record presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket.[136][137] A remaster of Bernstein's score was also released in June 2019, on compact disc, digital, and vinyl formats. It includes four unreleased tracks, and commentary by Bernstein's son Peter.[138]\n\n### Merchandise\n\nDeveloping merchandise for a film was still a relatively new practice at the time of Ghostbusters' release, and it was only following the success of Star Wars merchandise that other studios attempted to duplicate the idea.[139] The unexpected success of Ghostbusters meant Columbia did not have a comprehensive merchandising plan in place to fully capitalize on the film at the peak of its popularity.[140] They were able to generate additional revenue, however, by applying the popular \"no ghosts\" logo to a variety of products.[141] Much of the merchandising success came from licensing the rights to other companies based on the success of the 1986 animated spin-off The Real Ghostbusters.[140] Merchandise based directly on the film did not initially sell well until The Real Ghostbusters, which on its own helped generate up to $200 million in revenue in 1988, the same year the Ghostbusters proton pack was the most popular toy in the United Kingdom.[142][139] A successful Ghostbusters video game was released alongside the film.[143] The film also received two novelizations, Ghostbusters by Larry Milne (released with the film), and Ghostbusters: The Supernatural Spectacular by Richard Mueller (released in 1985).[5] \"Making Ghostbusters\", an annotated script by Ramis, was released in 1985.[8]\n\nIn the years since its release, Ghostbusters merchandise has included: soundtrack albums, action figures, books, Halloween costumes, various Lego and Playmobil sets including the Ectomobile and Firehouse,[144][145] board games,[146][147] slot machines,[148] pinball machines,[149] bobbleheads, statues, prop replicas, neon signs, ice cube trays, Minimates, coin banks,[140] Funko Pop figures,[150] footwear,[151] lunch boxes, and breakfast cereals.[84] A Slimer-inspired limited-edition citrus-flavored Hi-C Ecto Cooler drink first released in 1987, was one of the more popular items, and did not cease production until 2001.[144] The Slimer character became iconic and popular, appearing in video games, toys, cartoons, sequels, toothpaste, and juice boxes.[49] There have also been crossover products including comic books and toys that combine the Ghostbusters with existing properties like Men in Black,[152] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[153][144] Transformers,[154] and World Wrestling Entertainment.[155]\n\n## Thematic analysis\n\n### Capitalism and private industry\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan addressing the nation in 1981 on tax reduction. Ghostbusters has been analyzed as promoting Reagan's political policies, espousing limited regulation and a pro-business agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs described by academic Christine Alice Corcos, Ghostbusters is \"a satire on academia, intellectuals, city government, yuppies, tax professionals, and apathetic New Yorkers\".[156] It has also been analyzed as an era-appropriate example of Republican, libertarian, or neo-liberal ideology, in particular, Reagan-era economics popularized by United States President Ronald Reagan.[n] Reaganomics focused on limited government spending and deregulation in favor of a free market provided by the private sector of entrepreneurship, profit motives, and individual initiative.[158][159][160] Analysts point to the premise of a small private business obstructed by an arrogant, incompetent bureaucrat (Walter Peck) from a government agency. Peck's interference compromises the Ghostbusters' ghost containment unit, unleashing spirits upon the city and ushering in Gozer's arrival.[158][159] When Peck arrives to shutter the Ghostbusters, Egon affirms \"this is private property\".[160] In this sense, it is Peck, not Gozer, who represents the true villain.[159][160] Others note that after losing their university jobs, Aykroyd's character is upset because their public sector funding required little of them. He had worked in the private sector where \"they expect results\".[160] Reitman considered himself a \"conservative-slash-libertarian\".[160][161]\n\nThe Washington Examiner wrote that the private sector arrives to combat the supernatural activity in New York, for a fee, while the government is incapable of doing anything.[160][162] As Vox notes, the mayor, a government representative, is motivated to release the Ghostbusters after being reminded that their success will save the lives of \"millions of registered voters\", a cynical view of an official who is motivated by what allows him to retain his position.[158] The mayor's choice is ideological: the privatized free market of the Ghostbusters or the government agency Peck represents.[163] Even the police are forced to take Louis/Vinz to the Ghostbusters because they are incapable of dealing with him.[162] Author Ralph Clare highlights that the Ghostbusters reside in a disused firehouse and drive an old ambulance, each sold off as public services fail.[164] Corcos suggests the Ghostbusters are an example of the American free-thinker, representing vigilantes fighting against government overreach that is worsening the issue.[165]\n\nClare wrote that Ghostbusters embraces the free market in the aftermath of American financial despair in the 1970s, particularly in New York City that led to films set in a gritty, collapsing, crime-ridden, and failed New York, such as Taxi Driver (1976), The Warriors (1979), and Escape from New York (1981).[166] Ghostbusters was created at the beginning of an economic recovery that Clare described as \"pure capitalism\", focused on the privatization and deregulation to allow the private sector to supplant the government.[157] The necessity of the mayor outsourcing the ghost problem mirrors the real New York government ceding vast areas of real estate to corporations to stimulate renewal.[167] The use of capitalism can be further seen in how Ray, tasked to empty his mind, is incapable of recalling anything but a consumerist mascot; in another example, Dana's refrigerator, which stores consumerist icons, is where she witnesses Zuul.[168]\n\n### Inequality, immigrants, and pollution\n\nThe ghosts in Ghostbusters have been interpreted as analogs for crime, homelessness, pollution, and faltering infrastructure and public services.[165][169] Corcos discussed Ghostbusters's negative take on government and environmental regulation.[170] She wrote that the ghosts represent pollutants, remnants of environmental damage, and a reflection of real-life governments refusing to acknowledge environmental problems that affect humanity.[171] The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explicitly does not believe in the ghosts or \"waste\" the Ghostbusters are collecting and, in turn, the Ghostbusters do not believe the EPA deserves obedience or compliance because of its ignorance.[172] Even though the Ghostbusters have condensed a widespread problem into a small area, they have constructed a dangerous containment unit in a heavily populated area while possessing the unique knowledge to understand how much danger it poses.[173] However, Peck's rigid adherence to government regulation results in him turning off the unit and creating a more dangerous situation.[174]\n\nClare identified the ghosts as representative of New York's issues with the homeless and ethnic minorities. The ghosts, which were once human, are not acknowledged as such and are treated as a nuisance that the Ghostbusters transport to less desirable areas, similar to real-world gentrification. The Ghostbusters charge a substantial fee for their services and so generally serve the affluent such as the Sedgewick hotel and Dana Barrett, while poorer Chinese citizens pay for their services in meat.[169][175] In this way, Clare argues, Ghostbusters promotes the regeneration of New York City but ignores the cost to the poor and disenfranchised to achieve it.[176] Author Zoila Clark noted that concept art of an unused Chinatown ghost bore similarities to a stereotypical Chinese immigrant including long, braided hair and a triangular agricultural hat.[175]\n\n### Immaturity\n\nAuthor Nicole Matthews argued the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.[177] Critic Vincent Canby said a film's profitability was dependent on addressing children who \"can identify with a 40-year-old-man with a mid-life crisis and 40-year-old-men in midlife crises who long to fight pirates with cardboard cutlasses\".[178] Ghostbusters presents Venkman's immature comedic sarcasm as a means of disarming situations and furthering the narrative. Author Jim Whalley wrote that this presents a clear tonal shift in the sequel; in Ghostbusters, the characters are hired workers just doing their job, whereas in Ghostbusters II they are noble heroes saving the city. In doing so, Ghostbusters II reimagines Venkman's persona as comedic relief instead of a practical tool.[179] The primarily male audience also results in female characters that are either absent or not important to the overall story.[180] Author Jane Crisp wrote that Dana encountering Zuul in her fridge presents a stereotypical view of women being associated with the home and kitchen.[181]\n\n## Legacy\n\nGhostbusters is considered one of the first blockbusters and is credited with refining the term to effectively create a new genre that mixed comedy, science fiction, horror, and thrills. Ghostbusters also confirmed the merchandising success of Star Wars (1977) was not a fluke. A successful, recognizable brand could be used to launch spin-offs, helping establish a business model in the film industry that has since become the status quo. Once Ghostbusters' popularity was clear, the studio aggressively cultivated its profile, translating it into merchandising and other media such as television, extending its profitable lifetime long after the film had left theaters.[141]\n\nEntertainment industry observers credit Ghostbusters and Saturday Night Live with reversing the negative perception of New York City in the early 1980s.[8][182] Weaver said: \"I think it was a love letter to New York and New Yorkers ... the doorman saying, 'Someone brought a cougar to a party'—that's so New York. When we come down covered with marshmallow, and there are these crowds of New Yorkers of all types and descriptions cheering for us ... it was one of the most moving things I can remember\".[69][71] It is similarly credited with helping diminish the divide between television and film actors. Talent agent Michael Ovitz said that before Ghostbusters, television actors were only considered for minor roles in film.[8][182] Describing Ghostbusters' enduring popularity, Reitman said \"kids are all worried about death and... ghost-like things. By watching Ghostbusters, there's a sense that you can control this, that you can mitigate it somehow and it doesn't have to be that frightening. It became this movie that parents liked to bring their kids to—they could appreciate it on different levels but still watch it together\".[15]\n\n### Cultural influence\n\nGhostbusters was considered a phenomenon and highly influential.[o] The Ghostbusters' theme song was a hit, and Halloween of 1984 was dominated by children dressed as the titular protagonists.[8][141][184] It had a significant effect on popular culture and is credited with inventing the special-effects driven comedy.[p] Its basic premise of a particular genre mixed with comedy, and a team combating an otherworldly threat has been replicated with varying degrees of success in films like Men in Black (1997), Evolution (2001), The Watch (2012), R.I.P.D. (2013), and Pixels (2015).[66][185][186] In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected Ghostbusters for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Reitman responded: \"It's an honor to know that a movie that begins with a ghost in a library now has a spot on the shelves of the Library of Congress\".[187]\n\nIn 1984, the Ghostbusters phenomenon was referred to across dozens of advertisements for everything from airlines to dentistry and real estate. The \"-busters\" suffix became a common term used at both local and national stages, being applied to topics like the United States national budget (\"budgetbusters\"), agriculture (\"cropbusters\"), B-52s (\"nukebusters\"), sanitation (\"litterbusters\"), or Pan American Airlines (\"pricebusters\"). Similarly, the \"no ghosts\" logo was modified to protest political candidates like Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale to Mickey Mouse by striking Disney workers.[188] Other contributions to the cultural lexicon included \"Who ya gonna call?\" from Parker Jr's \"Ghostbusters\",[46] and Murray's adlib of \"this chick is toast\" against Gozer to imply she was finished or doomed over the scripted line of \"I'm gonna turn this guy into toast\". This is thought to be the first historic usage of \"toast\" as a slang term.[189]\n\nGhostbusters quickly developed a dedicated fan following that has continued to thrive in the years since.[144] Despite its mainstream success, it is considered an example of a cult blockbuster—a popular film with a dedicated fanbase.[63][190][191] It is popular globally, inspiring fan clubs, fan-made films,[192] art,[193] and conventions.[194] Fans dressed as Ghostbusters occasionally burst into the main reading room of the New York Public Library.[8] The 2016 crowdfunded documentary Ghostheads follows various fans of the series and details the effect it has had on their lives, interspersed with interviews from crew, including Aykroyd, Reitman, and Weaver.[195][196] A separate 2019 documentary, Cleanin' Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters, details the film production.[197] Memorabilia from the film is popular, with a screen-used proton pack selling for $169,000 at a 2012 auction.[198] In 2017, a newly discovered ankylosaur fossil was named Zuul crurivastator after Gozer's minion.[199][200]\n\nGhostbusters was turned into a special-effects laden stage show at Universal Studios Florida, which ran from 1990 to 1996, based mainly on the final battle with Gozer. The 2019 Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida hosted a haunted maze attraction featuring locations, characters, and ghosts from the film.[201][183] The film has also been homaged or explicitly referred to across a variety of media including film,[q] television,[205] and video games.[206][207] Aykroyd reprised his Ghostbuster character for a cameo in Casper (1995),[202] and the celebratory parade at the film's denouement inspired the ending of the 2012 superhero film The Avengers, showing the world celebrating the eponymous team's victory.[208]\n\n### Critical reassessment\n\nGhostbusters's positive reception has lasted well beyond its release, and it is considered one of the most important comedy films ever made.[144][209] It is listed in the 2013 film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.[210] On its 30th anniversary in 2014, The Hollywood Reporter's entertainment industry-voted ranking named it the seventy-seventh best film of all time.[211] That year, Time Out rated Ghostbusters five out of five, describing it as a \"cavalcade of pure joy\".[212] Empire's reader-voted list of the 100 Greatest Movies placed the film as number 68.[213] In 2014, Rolling Stone readers voted Ghostbusters the ninth-greatest film of the 1980s.[214] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 95% approval rating from 79 critics, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus reads: \"An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, with Bill Murray's hilarious deadpan performance leading a cast of great comic turns\".[215] The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on eight critical reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[216]\n\nIn 2001, the American Film Institute ranked Ghostbusters number 28 on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list recognizing the best comedy films.[217] In 2009, National Review ranked Ghostbusters number 10 on its list of the 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years, noting the \"regulation-happy\" Environmental Protection Agency is portrayed as the villain and it is the private sector that saves the day.[218] In November 2015, the screenplay was listed number 14 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Funniest Screenplays.[219] In 2017, the BBC polled 253 critics (118 female, 135 male) from across 52 countries on the funniest film made. Ghostbusters came ninety-fifth.[220]\n\nGhostbusters is considered one of the best films of the 1980s, appearing on several lists based on this metric, including: number two by Film.com,[221] number five by Time Out,[222] number six by ShortList,[223] number 15 by Complex,[224] number 31 by Empire,[225] and it appears on Filmsite's non-ranked list.[226] It also appeared on several media outlets' best comedy film lists—ranked number one by Entertainment Weekly,[227] number four by IGN,[228] number 10 by Empire,[229] number 25 by The Daily Telegraph,[230] and number 45 by Rotten Tomatoes,[231] which also listed the film number 71 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch.[232] Others have named it one of the best science-fiction films,[233] best science-fiction comedies,[234] and best summer blockbusters.[84][235] Murray's Peter Venkman appeared at number 44 on Empire's 2006 list of its \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\".[236]\n\n## Sequels and adaptations\n\nFollowing Harold Ramis's death in 2014, a potential third Ghostbusters film was replaced with a reboot. Fans commemorated Ramis by leaving tributes outside Hook &amp; Ladder 8.[144]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film's success spawned the Ghostbusters franchise, comprising animated television shows, film sequels, and reboot.[237] Ghostbusters was followed by the 1986 animated television series The Real Ghostbusters. It ran for 140 episodes over seven seasons across six years, and itself spawned a spin-off Slimer-centric sub-series, comic books, and merchandise. It was followed by a sequel series, 1997's Extreme Ghostbusters.[237][238] A film sequel, Ghostbusters II, was released in 1989. Despite breaking box office records and attracting an estimated two million more people to its opening than Ghostbusters, the sequel earned less than the original and received a less enthusiastic response.[239][240] Even so, the popularity of the actors and characters led to discussion of a third film.[240] The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate. In a 2009 interview, he said:\n\nWe did [Ghostbusters II] and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was ... the real thing. And the sequel ... They’d written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed] ... so there's never been an interest in a third Ghostbusters, because the second one was disappointing ... for me, anyway.[241]\n\nAykroyd pursued a sequel through to the early 2010s.[240] Ghostbusters: The Video Game was released in 2009, featuring narrative contributions from Ramis and Aykroyd, and voice acting by Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton. Set two years after Ghostbusters II, the story follows the Ghostbusters training a recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd has referred to the game as being \"essentially the third movie\".[240][242] Ghostbusters: The Return (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher went out of business. Several Ghostbusters comic books have continued the original group's adventures across the globe and other dimensions.[144][243]\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman determined the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal to sell the rights to Columbia; he spent two weeks convincing Murray. Reitman refused to detail the deal but said \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children's lives\". He and Aykroyd founded Ghost Corps, a production company dedicated to expanding the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot Ghostbusters (later retitled Ghostbusters: Answer the Call).[r] Before its release, the reboot was beset by controversies. After its release, it was considered a box-office bomb with mixed reviews.[s] The franchise returned to the original two films with the sequels, Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), directed by Reitman's son Jason, and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024).[252][253]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Columbia-Delphi Productions and Dan Aykroyd's Black Rhino are credited as the production companies behind Ghostbusters.[1][2]\n- ^ The estimated $200 million required to realize Dan Aykroyd's original vision for Ghostbusters is equivalent to $631 million in 2024.\n- ^ The 1984 budget of $25–30 million is equivalent to $78.9 million–$94.7 million in 2024.\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[9][10][25][26]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[8][10][49][50]\n- ^ The opening weekend gross of $13.6 million is equivalent to $41.2 million in 2024.\n- ^ The opening week gross of $23.1 million is equivalent to $69.9 million in 2024.\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[1][70][76][77]\n- ^ The United States and Canada theatrical gross of $229 million is equivalent to $693 million in 2024.\n- ^ The estimated $128 million profit is equivalent to $387 million in 2024.\n- ^ The estimated $20–$30 million earned by Bill Murray is equivalent to $60.5 million–$90.8 million in 2024.\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[99][104][105][108][109]\n- ^ The $79.95 and $29.95 cost of a VHS cassette in 1985 is equivalent to $234.00 and $88.00, respectively, in 2024.\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[157][158][159][160]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[8][71][141][183]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[8][71][141][183]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[46][202][203][204]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[244][245][246][247]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[248][249][250][251]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u \"Ghostbusters (1984)\".

It stars <MainCharacters>Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis</MainCharacters> as Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler, three eccentric parapsychologists who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. It also stars <MainCharacters>Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis</MainCharacters>, and features Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and William Atherton in supporting roles.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n            Based on his fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project starring himself and John Belushi, in which they would venture through time and space battling supernatural threats. Following Belushi's death in 1982, and with Aykroyd's concept deemed financially impractical, Ramis was hired to help rewrite the script to set it in New York City and make it more realistic. It was the first comedy film to employ expensive special effects, and Columbia Pictures, concerned about its relatively high <Budget>$25–30 million</Budget> budget, had little faith in its box office potential. Filming took place from October 1983 to January 1984, in New York City and Los Angeles.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n            Ghostbusters was released on <ReleaseYear>June 8, 1984</ReleaseYear>, to critical acclaim and became a cultural phenomenon. It was praised for its blend of comedy, action, and horror, and Murray's performance was often singled out for praise. It earned at least <BoxOffice>$282 million</BoxOffice> worldwide during its initial theatrical run and was the second-highest-grossing film of 1984 in the United States and Canada, and the then-highest-grossing comedy ever. \n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n            With its effect on popular culture, and a dedicated fan following, the success of Ghostbusters launched a multi-billion dollar multimedia franchise. This included the popular animated television series The Real Ghostbusters (1986), its follow-up Extreme Ghostbusters (1997), video games, board games, comic books, clothing, music, and haunted attractions. Ghostbusters was followed in 1989 by Ghostbusters II, which fared less well financially and critically, and attempts to develop a second sequel paused in 2014 following Ramis's death. After a 2016 reboot received mixed reviews and underperformed financially, a second sequel to the 1984 film, Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), was released, followed by Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024).\n        </Paragraph>\n    </Content>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\n### Summary\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes of the `MovieRecommendation` class.

(...) Don't tell anyone. It's my secret spot. My secret spot in Asteroid City. It's kind of a hidden gem.\"\n\n- GoofsThe newspaper shows a photo of the alien with a shadow, as if taken with a flashbulb, but Augie did not use a flash.\n\n- QuotesAugie Steenbeck: I still don't understand the play.Schubert Green: Doesn't matter. Just keep telling the story.\n\n- Crazy creditsAt the very end of the end credits, over a black screen a voice whispers, \"Wicked.\"\n\n- Alternate versionsTheatrically, the film is presented entirely within a 2.39:1 frame; the corresponding academy ratio 1.37:1 scenes are windowboxed within that frame. The Blu-Ray, DVD, and streaming version presents everything within a 1.78:1 framing, letterboxing the 2.39:1 segments and pillarboxing the 1.37:1 segments. The opening Focus Features and Indian Paintbrush logos are presented in full 1.78:1.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Amanda the Jedi Show: Never Trust the Standing Ovations | CANNES 2023 Indiana Jones, Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)\n\n- SoundtracksLast Train to San Fernando\nWritten by Sylvester DeVere, Randolph Padmore, Kenneth St. Bernard\nPerformed by Johnny Duncan and the Blue Grass Boys\nCourtesy of Columbia Records Nashville\nBy arrangement with Sony Music Entertainment\n\n### User reviews712\n\nFeatured review\n\n### A Wes Anderson overdose in the desert: More of a stiff stage play than a \"real\" movie\n\nLet me start off by saying: I have seen all of Wes Anderson's movies (including his ad work and his short movies), some of them even multiple times.\n\nI can therefore certainly appreciate his quirky and unique style that made him a favorite at various film schools and among art-house movie lovers.\n\nAsteroid City feels like a very concentrated version of his latest movies in a bland desert setting:\n\nThe black-and-white scenes in old TV formatting as well as the theatre-like setups reminded me of the \"The French Dispatch\" (2021) in particular. The newest movie doubles down on these \"theatre/stage play\" concepts, the sum of all parts unfortunately feels like a Wes Anderson overdose at times:\n\nToo many actors (the usual staple of big-name actors is larger than ever in this one, only Bill Murray seems to be missing), yet with no real lead role present and very little character development.\n\nThe overall plot appears to be going nowhere until the credits roll - while the 1950's SF sub-\"plot\" also feels wasted when the Alien in his bright green UFO has a screen appearance about as short as the mythical 'Jaguar shark' in Wes' classic \"The Life Aquatic\" (2004).\n\nAsteroid City looks like Wes jumped the shark on his own ideas and prior body of work.\n\nOverall, the movie unfortunately feels too dry, stiff and boring to me (I would never write this about a prior Wes Anderson movie), even with its relatively short running time.\n\nSummary: Asteroid City will most likely only please and appeal to his most hardcore fans. Another IMDB reviewer summed it up perfectly with this headline: \"Nothing happens in the middle of nowhere\".\n\n4/10 , maybe rounded up to 5/10 for the (as always) beautiful decor and the immaculate attention to detail.\n\nI hope Wes returns to \"real\" film-making one day. I wanted to see a \"real\" movie by Wes Anderson, not a \"Wes Anderson doing Wes Anderson\" stage play in the desert.\n\nPS: (Edit). I have since found two professional reviews that almost perfectly match my impressions (quoted via Wikipedia):\n\n\"A review in the Alton Telegraph entitled, \"'Asteroid City' script lacks direction and plot,\" said, \"'Asteroid City' made no sense. The script was mind-numbing. I saw several people nod off because they were bored.\" Time Magazine's review was titled \"Asteroid City Is Too Stiff and Stylized-Even for a Wes Anderson Movie, \" saying \"Wes Anderson's Asteroid City is what happens when a filmmaker's world of wonder and whimsy becomes a prison.\"\n\nYes, indeed. Asteroid City is what happens when a filmmaker's quirky world becomes a prison.\n\n- helloamazon\n- Jun 19, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n## 24 Frames From Wes Anderson Films\n\n## 24 Frames From Wes Anderson Films\n\nExplore the memorable career of Wes Anderson through 24 stills from his movies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is Asteroid City?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - June 22, 2023 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Астероїд-Сіті\n- Filming locations\n    - Chinchón, Madrid, Spain\n- Production companies\n    - Focus Features\n    - Indian Paintbrush\n    - American Empirical Pictures\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $25,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $28,153,025\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $853,382\n    - Jun 18, 2023\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $53,857,743\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 45 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n    - Black and White\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - 12-Track Digital Sound\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n    - Auro 11.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Asteroid City (2023) in India?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Burmese Freedom Fighters have even adopted dialogue from the movie as battle cries, most notably \"Live for nothing, or die for something.\" Sylvester Stallone said \"That, to me, is one of the proudest moments I've ever had in film.\"\n\n- GoofsThe large bomb found in the jungle is not a Tallboy as previously suggested, but a \"Grand Slam\", the successor to the Tallboy bomb. The key indicator is the overall size of the larger 22,000 pound bomb, and the aerofoil shape of the stabilizing fins, versus the relatively flat fins of the tallboy.\nIt's perfectly plausible that such a bomb could sympathetically detonate after 60 years in the jungle. The explosive filler is a cast RDX/TNT based explosive (torpex) which is more or less impervious to the elements. While it's entirely possible, and quite likely that the secondary booster explosives would have deteriorated, and indeed the very fact that the bomb did not explode when dropped would suggest that the fuses were damaged or misused, it's entirely possible that a very large container of torpex could be sympathetically detonated with a C4-based claymore. The implausible aspect of the bomb is that, indeed, they were only used in Germany, were extremely rare and expensive, and could only be dropped from a fairly specialized Lancaster bomber.\n\n- QuotesJohn Rambo: [while aiming an arrow at Lewis' eye] Any of you boys want to shoot, now's the time. There isn't one of us that doesn't want to be someplace else. But this is what we do, who we are. Live for nothing, or die for something. Your call.\n\n- Crazy creditsSandwich Makers - Permpoon Penjan and Parichat U-Tama\n\n- Alternate versionsTo secure a \"Not under 18\" rating from the FSK, the German theatrical version was cut by ca. 1 minute. To achieve this rating for the DVD, one additional minute was cut. For the German sell-through version (rated \"Not under 16\"), almost every violent bit was removed. The uncut version was released with a SPIO/JK certificate. 15 years later, the movie was eventually removed from the index list and shortly afterwards the FSK finally granted the uncensored version a \"Not under 18\" rating.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Rambo: Deleted Scenes (2008)\n\n- SoundtracksRambo: First Blood Theme\nWritten by Jerry Goldsmith (BMI)\nPublished by Universal Music Publishing o/b/o El Cajo Music Company (BMI)\n\n### User reviews843\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Just look at the tagline: \"Heroes never die........they just reload.\"\n\nJust watch it, words don't justify it! People didn't believe Sly still had it, but they were so wrong. After the the great performance at Rocky Balboa I expected another great performance for him. But this was even better than I imagined. You don't have to be an Stallone fan to enjoy this movie. If you like action movies, this one is for you. A word of caution though, this isn't for the light hearted, there are some serious violence in this movie. I am gonna say this is one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. But you don't have to take my word for it, just watch it. It's better than the previous Rambo films. Expcept for about 15 minutes in the middle, the whole film is action packed. You can't possibly be bored. If you hate action movie or if you have something against violence, this isn't for you. But if you are not, than sit back and enjoy the legend that is Rambo for one last time.\n\n- rhapsody-zaman\n- Jan 24, 2008\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n## Sylvester Stallone's Most Iconic Roles\n\n## Sylvester Stallone's Most Iconic Roles\n\nWe're celebrating the iconic  with a look back at some of his most indelible film performances, from Rocky and Rambo, to Joe in the new superhero movie .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### FAQ30\n\n- How long is Rambo?Powered by Alexa\n- The leading missionary claims that he has gone into Burma five times.

This was one of the first films I ever analyzed using a Storyclock. It introduced me to the idea of symmetry in storytelling, and how well-told stories with great structure and pacing have rhythm and rhyme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI watched the movie and wrote down everything important that happened and the timecode for when it happened. Then I transferred it all to a clock, and started tracing story threads.\n\nWhen I visualized the film this way, I started to notice key story beats scattered symmetrically throughout the story. This led me down the path of reverse engineering this process of story analysis into a process for story development, leading to the eventual creation of the Storyclock Notebook!\n\n#### Let's Break It Down\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Opening Image: The entire opening scene serves as an \"opening image,\" establishing the character, the world, the tone, and the potential in all of it, in a mind-boggingly efficient and effective way.\n- Normalcy: After getting a taste of Indy's weekends as a globe-trotting archaeologist/universally acceptable grave robber, we get a taste of his weekdays as a dreamy professor and teacher of \"FACT, not TRUTH.\"\n- Normalcy Disrupted: Indy is approached by government men seeking information about the Ark of the Covenant.\n- Herald/Refusal/etc: It doesn't take a lot to get Indy onboard for this thing. He's basically on a plane already before the government men can finish saying \"ark of the covenant,\" but if you were to insist on running it through the monomyth machine, one could argue that the \"call\" Indy \"refuses\" is the magical/spiritual aspect of the Ark, with his \"acceptance of the call\" found through his devotion to history, facts, and wearing jackets in 90 degree weather.\n- Acceptance: Brody stops by Indy's house that night to remind him of the film's stakes and ensure that Marion is sufficiently foreshadowed. Indy responds by laughing in his face and hurling a weapon across the room to demonstrate his understanding of both the film's stakes and the visual language of scene transition in film.\n- Break Into Act 2: Indy and Dennis Muren board the plane to Nepal.\n- B Story Begins: Indy travels to Nepal, where we meet Marion Ravenwood, who has the headpiece Indy needs to find the location of the Ark. We establish their complicated (and deeply problematic if you do the math) history, kicking it off with a punch to the face and an argument.\n- Trailer Moments: Bar fight! Street fight! Swords! Guns! Baskets! Map room! Spiritual laser beam! Spielberg manages to craft compelling drama out of a guy placing a stick in the floor and standing there.\n- Midpoint/Arrival at Solution: Indy finds the location of the Well of Souls, where the Ark is to be found. He has the locals start digging while he takes some sweet sillhouette shots for his profile (I'm sorry for this joke).\n- Things Get Worse: Turns out the Well of Souls is full of snakes. Also turns out Belloch found out what they're doing. He takes the Ark and throws Marion down there with Indy and seals it up. But Indy's smart enough to know that all ancient tombs have back doors that are far easier to open than whatever complicated and trap-laden way they came in. More often than not, these back doors will open up to populated areas, and will merely require the moving of a stone to exfiltrate the premises. You may wonder why people are always going to elaborate lengths to find and infiltrate these tombs the way they do, rather than just using these back doors. It's a valid question. One I fear we may never get an answer to.\n- Hero's Last Resort: Indy finds out the Ark is on a truck, chases it down, and blows it up.\n- Game Over: He's got the ark. He's got Marion. They're on a ship. How is this the low point of the story? That's one of my many genius things about this movie. The low point is low not because the hero failed, it's low because the hero succeeded and yet we just don't feel like the movie is over, yet. We're not fulfilled. This can't be the end, right?\n- Breakthrough and Rebirth/Break Into Act 3: Thankfully, the nazis are back (the only appropriate time to ever say that sentence). They steal Marion and the Ark. Now Indy's got something to do again. And that something is: ride a submarine across the Aegean Sea and not drown to death.\n- Hero Gains Upper Hand: Indy finds himself a rocket launcher and threatens to blow up the Ark.\n- Shadow's Final Push: Belloch convinces Indy not to do it, appealing to his history nerd side. Also if he did it, he'd blow Marion up, too, which wouldn't be great. Belloch and the nazis open the Ark and...\n- Ultimate Breakthrough: ...surprise! God's inside, and He's not crazy about nazis. Melty face. Implosion face. Explosion face.\n- New Normalcy: Indy can't get the government men to tell him where the Ark is. But he's got Marion by his side. Perhaps she was the real prize all along.\n- Final Image: The Ark is wheeled into a massive warehouse, never to be seen again. Until it's seen again.\n- Symmetrical Beats: The Ark is first mentioned and we see a picture of it being opened + Indy finds the location of the Ark + Indy finds the ark + the Ark is opened.\n- Symmetrical Beats: Marion punches Indy + Marion kisses Indy.\n- Symmetrical Beats: Belloch takes the idol + Belloch takes Marion + Belloch takes the Ark + the Ark takes Belloch.\n\n#### Stuff That Stood Out To Me\n\n- It's fascinating that this movie is so perfect when you consider that the film was actually an experiment in imperfection for Spielberg. Having become known in Hollywood as a perfectionist who often came in over budget and behind schedule, he and George Lucas agreed to shoot the film as efficiently as possible, even if it meant settling for less-than-perfect takes. I preach all the time that perfection is a myth and a hinderance for filmmakers, and that your success is often determined by how you choose to settle.\n- The opening is like a proof of concept short for the rest of the film. It's so good that, supposedly, Spielberg was worried that he'd made the opening too good, and that the rest of the film would never live up to it.\n- Marion appears to stone cold die before we even reach the midpoint. An insanely bold move to make in a fun adventure movie like this, but an even more insanely bold move to make so soon after you've introduced the character!\n- The nazis are brought up in conversation quite a lot, but we don't actually see a nazi uniform for most of the first half of the film. The first time we see a swastika is on the flag in the map room. Another lessons in how keeping your villainous force in the shadows as long as possible will make their eventual arrival more impactful.\n\nHow cool is it that on one side of the clock we have Indy showing us a history book illustration of the Ark being opened, and directly opposite that we have the Ark actually being opened?\n\nBut here's the thing, and this is important: none of this means that Lawrence Kasdan wrote RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK with a storyclock.\n\nWhat it does mean: well-told stories have rhythm and rhyme. Great structure and pacing are what create this kind of symmetry.\n\nIt also means we can reverse engineer this whole crazy concept of story symmetry to help us in developing our own story ideas.

It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. Believing computer hacker Neo to be \"the One\" prophesied to defeat them, Morpheus recruits him into a rebellion against the machines.\n\nFollowing the success of Bound (1996), Warner Bros. gave the go-ahead for The Matrix after the Wachowskis sent an edit of the film's opening minutes. Action scenes were influenced by anime and martial arts films, (particularly fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema). Other influences include Plato's cave and 1990s Telnet hacker communities. The film popularized terms such as the red pill, and popularised a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which a character's heightened perception is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.\n\nThe Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value.[6][7] The film was a box office success, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of that year. The film received nominations at the 72nd Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing, winning all four categories. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, including Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects at the 53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awarded Best Director and Best Science Fiction Film at the 26th Saturn Awards. The Matrix is considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time,[8][9][10] and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\".[11]\n\nThe film's success led to two sequels by the Wachowskis, both released in 2003, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and an animated anthology film, The Animatrix, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titled The Matrix Resurrections, directed solely by Lana Wachowski was released in 2021.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1999, in an unnamed city, Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer known as \"Neo\" in hacking circles, delves into the mystery of the \"Matrix\". His search brings him to the attention of hacker Trinity, who discloses that the enigmatic Morpheus can answer Neo's questions. At his workplace, Neo is pursued by police and Agents led by Agent Smith. Morpheus guides Neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements, but Neo ultimately surrenders rather than risk a hazardous getaway.\n\nThe Agents interrogate Neo about Morpheus but he refuses to cooperate. In response, Neo's mouth suddenly seals shut and the Agents implant a robotic device in his abdomen. Neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare until Trinity and her allies arrive, extract the implanted tracker, and bring Neo to Morpheus, their leader. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. Opting for the red pill, Neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. Neo witnesses countless inert humans similarly encased and tended to by machines before he is ejected from the facility and rescued by Morpheus aboard the hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nMorpheus reveals that the year is approximately 2199. In the 21st century, humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the Earth a devastated ruin. As a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bioelectric energy. The Matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. The remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as Zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources. Morpheus and his rebel crew hack into the Matrix to free others and recruit them, manipulating the rules of the simulation to gain superhuman physical abilities. Even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful Agents—sentient programs protecting the Matrix—and dying in the Matrix causes death in the real world. Morpheus liberated Neo because he believes him to be \"the One\", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the Matrix and liberate humanity.\n\nThe crew enter the Matrix to seek guidance from the Oracle, the prophetic figure who foretold the existence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns him of an imminent choice between his life and Morpheus's. The crew are ambushed by Agents after being betrayed by Cypher, a resentful crew member who wants to be reinserted into the Matrix to enjoy its comforts. Convinced of Neo's importance, Morpheus sacrifices himself to confront Smith, only to be overpowered and captured. Meanwhile, Cypher exits the Matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank, a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills Cypher, and safely extracts the survivors.\n\nSmith interrogates Morpheus to obtain access codes for Zion's mainframe, which will allow them to end the human resistance. Determined to rescue Morpheus, Neo re-enters the Matrix with Trinity. They successfully free Morpheus, who escapes the Matrix with Trinity, but Smith intercepts Neo. Gaining confidence in his abilities, Neo fights Smith, demonstrating comparable power and eventually killing him. However, Smith resurrects in a new body and kills Neo.\n\nIn the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar. Standing by Neo's real body, Trinity confesses her love for him and that the Oracle prophesied she would fall in love with the One. In the Matrix, Neo revives with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly destroys Smith and exits the Matrix just as the Nebuchadnezzar's electromagnetic pulse disables the ship's power and the Sentinels. Sometime later, within the Matrix, Neo communicates with the system, promising to show the enslaved humans a world of limitless possibilities, before flying away.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop to bottom: , , and  star in the film as ,  and  respectively.\n\n- Keanu Reeves as Neo: A computer programmer, born Thomas A. Anderson, who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo. Reeves described his character as someone who felt that something was wrong, and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break free.[12] Will Smith turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West, because of skepticism over the film's ambitious bullet time special effects.[13] He later stated he was \"not mature enough as an actor\" at that time,[13] and that if given the role, he \"would have messed it up\".[14][15] Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal.[16] Nicolas Cage also turned down the part because of \"family obligations\".[17] Warner Bros. sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer for the role.[18] When both declined, Leonardo DiCaprio initially accepted the role, but ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly after Titanic.[19] The studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role over Johnny Depp, the Wachowskis' first choice.[18] Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that the screenplay was also sent to Sandra Bullock, with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female.[19]\n- Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus: A human freed from the Matrix and captain of the Nebuchadnezzar. Fishburne stated that once he read the script, he did not understand why other people found it confusing. However, he doubted if the movie would ever be made, because it was \"so smart\".[12] The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the character Morpheus in Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics.[20] Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer were also considered for the part.[18]\n- Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity: A human freed by Morpheus, a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, and later Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them.[12] Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently.[21] The role made Moss, who later said, \"I had no career before. None.\"[22] Janet Jackson was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it.[23][24] In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the 'Intro' and 'Outro' interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline.[25] Sandra Bullock, who was previously approached for the role of Neo, was also offered the role of Trinity, but she turned it down.[26] Rosie Perez, Salma Hayek and Jada Pinkett Smith (who would later play Niobe in the sequels) auditioned for the role.[27][28][29]\n- Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith: A sentient \"Agent\" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other Agents, he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that he found the character amusing and enjoyable to play. He developed a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that the Wachowskis' voices had influenced his voice in the film. When filming began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him.[30] Jean Reno was offered the role, but declined, unwilling to move to Australia for the production.[31]\n- Joe Pantoliano as Cypher: Another human freed by Morpheus, and a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, but one who regrets taking the red pill and seeks to be returned to the Matrix, later betraying the rebels to Agent Smith. Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing in The Matrix, starring in their 1996 film Bound.\n- Marcus Chong as Tank: The \"operator\" of the Nebuchadnezzar and Dozer's brother; they are both \"natural\" (as opposed to bred) humans, born outside of the Matrix.\n- Matt Doran as Mouse: A freed human and a programmer on the Nebuchadnezzar.\n- Rowan Witt as The Spoon Boy, a young prophet who has learnt how to manipulate the world of the Matrix. Seemingly wise beyond his years, he teaches Neo how to develop his powers and provides him with wisdom and motivation across the films and graphic novels.\n- Gloria Foster as The Oracle: A prophet who still resides in the Matrix, helping the freed humans with her foresight and wisdom.\n- Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer: Pilot of the Nebuchadnezzar. He is Tank's brother, and like him was born outside of the Matrix.\n- Julian Arahanga as Apoc: A freed human and a crew member on the Nebuchadnezzar.\n- Belinda McClory as Switch: A human freed by Morpheus, and a crew member of the Nebuchadnezzar.\n- Paul Goddard as Agent Brown: One of two sentient \"Agent\" programs in the Matrix, who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system.\n- Robert Taylor as Agent Jones: One of two sentient \"Agent\" programs in the Matrix who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system.\n- Ada Nicodemou as DuJour: A reference to the White Rabbit in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nIn 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film Assassins to Warner Bros. Pictures. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, Bound and The Matrix, in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed, Bound, then became a critical success. Using this momentum, they later asked to direct The Matrix.[32] Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a \"different sex than the Zion reality\" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version.[33]\n\nIn 1996, the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo to Will Smith. Smith explained on his YouTube channel that the idea was for him to be Neo, while Morpheus was to be played by Val Kilmer. He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead film Wild Wild West.[34]\n\nProducer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters, including Silver and Di Bonaventura, to influence the company, The Matrix was still a huge investment for Warner Bros., which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with prominent actors and difficult special effects.[32] The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film.[35][36][37] The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget.[32] Soon, The Matrix became a co-production of Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures.[38] According to editor Zach Staenberg on the DVD audio commentary track, the production team sent an edit of the film's first minutes (featuring Trinity's encounter with police and Agents) to Warner executives, and secured Warner's \"total support of the movie\" from then on.[39]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nThe cast were required to be able to understand and explain The Matrix.[32] French philosopher Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew.[40] In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves and Moss read Simulacra and Simulation, Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology even before they opened up the script.[12] Eventually, Reeves was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved.[32] Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.[12]\n\nThe directors had long been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema, so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu, the actors had to train hard for several months.[32] The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training, beginning in October 1997.[41] Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.[21]\n\nYuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves's diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision and Moss's feminine grace.[21] Yuen designed Moss's moves to suit her deftness and lightness.[42] Prior to the pre-production, Reeves underwent a two-level fusion of his cervical (neck) spine due to spinal cord compression from a herniated disc (\"I was falling over in the shower in the morning\").[43] He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film.[21][44] Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process.[32]\n\n### Filming\n\nCampbell Street train bridge at the intersection of Elizabeth Street was one of the filming locations in the city of Sydney.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center.[45][46] Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days.[47] Some filming also occurred at Culver Studios.[48]\n\nDue to Reeves's neck injury (see above), some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion,[49][50] such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room,[30] or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle.[51] Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, halfway between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself.[52] During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. The bullet-time fight scene was filmed on the roof of Symantec Corporation building in Kent Street, opposite Sussex Street.[53]\n\nMoss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself.[42] The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films.[54] During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.[55]\n\nFishburne later said that while being in Sydney to shoot the film, he experienced a racist vibe and that it felt like America in the 1950s.[56]\n\nThe dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to filming meant he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.[57]\n\nThe filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station, but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves's stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot in which Neo was slammed into a booth.[58] The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale, light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had a real minigun side-mounted to it, which was set to cycle at half its regular (3,000 rounds per minute) firing rate.[59]\n\nTo prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds (7 kg) and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography.[47] According to The Art of the Matrix, at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film.[60]\n\n### Sound effects and music\n\nDane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together.[61]\n\nThe film's score, The Matrix: Original Motion Picture Score, was composed by Don Davis.[62][63] He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.[64]\nIn addition to Davis' score, The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Lunatic Calm, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto and Marilyn Manson.[65][66][67]\n\n### Production design\n\nIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters.[68] This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley,[38] which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals.[69] In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\".[70] \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors\".[71] Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall.[38] The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, Ghost in the Shell, which had a strong influence on the Matrix series. It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game The Matrix: Path of Neo, and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the Matrix series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.[38]\n\nThe Matrix's production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the \"real world\" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the \"real world\". In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the \"real world\", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.[69]\n\nThe Nebuchadnezzar was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on productions such as Star Trek. The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as \"a marriage between Man and Machine\".[72] For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.[47]\n\nKym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume.[73] For example, Reeves's office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled and out of place.[49] Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses.[73] For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character.[42] For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film JFK and classic men in black.[30]\n\nThe sunglasses, a staple of the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglasses maker Blinde Design.[74]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe \"bullet time\" effect was created for the film. A scene would be computer-modeled to decide the positioning of the physical cameras. The actor then provided their performance in a chroma key setup, while the cameras were fired in rapid succession, with fractions of a second delay between each shot. The result was combined with CGI backgrounds to create the final effect at (0:33).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would credit Otomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directed Akira, which definitely blew me away, along with director Michel Gondry. His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around—rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves.\n\nThe film is known for popularizing a visual effect[76] known as \"bullet time\", which allows a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.[77][78] Bullet time has been described as \"a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix\",[79] and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space.[80] The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Mass.Illusion to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor.[81][82]\n\nThe method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera captures a still picture, contributing one frame to the video sequence, which creates the effect of \"virtual camera movement\"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.[77]\n\nThe bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion.[75][81] The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect.[77] When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film.[32] Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side.[77] To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.[citation needed]\n\nThe photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene,[81] and algorithms based on optical flow were used to interpolate between the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion;[83][84] the computer-generated \"lead in\" and \"lead out\" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene.[85] Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film's visual effects.[86][87]\n\nManex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.[88]\n\nThe photogrammetric and image-based computer-generated background approaches in The Matrix's bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.[81]\n\n## Release\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Matrix was released on DVD and Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 on September 21, 1999, in the US from Warner Home Video as well as in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in Hong Kong from ERA Home Entertainment. It was also released on VHS in both full screen and widescreen formats on December 7, 1999.[5] After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US.[89] By 2000, the film went on to become the first to sell more than three million copies in the US.[32] At that point, it became the top-selling DVD release of all time, holding this record for a few months before being surpassed by Gladiator.[90] By November 10, 2003, one month after The Matrix Reloaded DVD was released, the sales of The Matrix DVD had exceeded 30 million copies.[91] It then debuted on both VHS and DVD formats in the UK on November 29, 1999. The Matrix sold more than 107,000 DVD copies in just two weeks, breaking Armageddon's record for being the country's best-selling DVD title.[92] The Ultimate Matrix Collection was released on HD DVD on May 22, 2007,[89] and on Blu-ray on October 14, 2008.[93][94] The film was also released standalone in a 10th-anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format on March 31, 2009, ten years to the day after the film was released theatrically.[95] In 2010, the film had another DVD release along with the two sequels as The Complete Matrix Trilogy. It was also released on 4K HDR Blu-ray on May 22, 2018.[96] The film as part of The Matrix Trilogy was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 30, 2018.[97]\n\n### Other media\n\nThe franchise also contains four video games: Enter the Matrix (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during The Matrix Reloaded;[98] The Matrix Online (2004), an MMORPG which continued the story beyond The Matrix Revolutions;[99][100] The Matrix: Path of Neo (2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films;[101] and The Matrix Awakens (2021), an interactive technology demonstration developed by Epic Games using Unreal Engine 5.[102]\n\nThe franchise also includes The Matrix Comics, a series of comics and short stories set in the world of The Matrix, written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the official Matrix website;[103] they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes, called The Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2.[104]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Matrix grossed $27.8 million during its opening weekend, as well as earning $37.4 million in its first five days.[105] It surpassed Lost in Space and Indecent Proposal simultaneously having the biggest April and Easter opening weekends.[105] The film also had the second-highest opening weekend for a spring starter film, trailing behind Liar Liar.[105] Three years later in 2002, The Matrix's records for having the largest April and Easter opening weekends would be taken by The Scorpion King and Panic Room respectively.[106][107] Upon its opening, it had the highest opening weekend of any 1999 film, easily topping Payback.[105] Additionally, this was the biggest opening weekend for a Keanu Reeves film since Speed in 1994.[108] It would go on to rank number one at the box office during its first weekend, beating out Forces of Nature, 10 Things I Hate About You, The Out-of-Towners, Analyze This and EDtv.[105] The film would remain at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was overtaken by Life.[109] During its fourth weekend, The Matrix briefly returned to the number one spot.[110][111] The following week, the film would be displaced by Entrapment.[112]\n\nIn the UK, The Matrix earned $4.9 million in its first three days, ranking it as the third-highest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film, behind Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin, while also delivering the third-highest opening weekend of the year, after A Bug's Life and Notting Hill.[113]\n\nIn its original run, the film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in the United States and Canada and $292,037,453 (63.0%) in other countries, for a worldwide total of $463,517,383.[5] In North America, it went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film of 1999 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of that year. Worldwide, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year, after Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, The Sixth Sense and Toy Story 2.[5] The Matrix became the second-highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time, behind Twister.[114] Overall, it was the third-highest-grossing R-rated film at the time, just after Saving Private Ryan and Terminator 2: Judgment Day.[114] Following re-releases, the worldwide gross of the film is $466,621,824.[5] In 2012, it was placed 122nd on the list of highest-grossing films of all time, and the second-highest-grossing film in the Matrix franchise after The Matrix Reloaded ($742.1 million).[5]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Matrix was praised by many critics, as well as filmmakers, and authors of science fiction,[7] especially for its \"spectacular action\" scenes and its \"groundbreaking special effects\". Some have described The Matrix as one of the best science fiction films of all time;[8][9] Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix \"the most influential action movie of the generation\".[22] There have also been those, including philosopher William Irwin, who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 210 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\".[6] At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[7] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[115] It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound polls of the greatest films ever made.[116]\n\nPhilip Strick commented in Sight &amp; Sound, if the Wachowskis \"claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,\" praising the film's details and its \"broadside of astonishing images\".[117] Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four: he praised the film's visuals and premise, but disliked the third act's focus on action.[118] Similarly, Time Out praised the \"entertainingly ingenious\" switches between different realities, Hugo Weaving's \"engagingly odd\" performance, and the film's cinematography and production design, but concluded, \"the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic ... yet another slice of overlong, high-concept hokum.\"[119]\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as \"simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.\"[120]\n\nIan Nathan of Empire described Carrie-Anne Moss as \"a major find\", praised the \"surreal visual highs\" enabled by the bullet time (or \"flo-mo\") effect, and described the film as \"technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool\". Nathan remarked that although the film's \"looney plot\" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because \"The Matrix is about pure experience\".[121] Maitland McDonagh said in her review for TV Guide, the Wachowskis' \"through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits.\"[122]\n\nSalon's reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that although The Matrix is in his view a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (\"It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the over-ramped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside\"), he concluded, \"as in Bound, there's an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for movies—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep.\"[123]\n\nFilmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of The Matrix. William Gibson, a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film \"an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time\", and stated, \"Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.\"[124] Joss Whedon called the film \"my number one\" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, \"It works on whatever level you want to bring to it\".[125] Darren Aronofsky commented, \"I walked out of The Matrix ... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured.\"[126] M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for the Wachowskis, stating, \"Whatever you think of The Matrix, every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!\".[127] Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided \"the excitement and satisfaction that The Phantom Menace failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen.\"[128] Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favorite movies from 1992 to 2009.[129] James Cameron called it \"one of the most profoundly fresh science fiction films ever made\".[130] Christopher Nolan described it as \"an incredibly palpable mainstream phenomenon that made people think, Hey, what if this isn't real?\"[131]\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe Matrix received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound.[132][133] The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, like Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, yet they won all four of their nominations.[134][135] The Matrix also received BAFTA awards for Best Sound and Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in the cinematography, production design and editing categories.[136] In 1999, it won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction.[137] In February 2022, the film was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, for the \"bullet time\" scene, finishing in fifth place.[138][139]\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\n| Award                       | Category                    | Name                                                                | Outcome    |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Academy Awards              | Best Film Editing           | Zach Staenberg                                                      | Won        |\n| Academy Awards              | Best Sound                  | John Reitz, Gregg Rudloff, David Campbell, David Lee                | Won        |\n| Academy Awards              | Best Sound Effects Editing  | Dane A.

C. Escher.[142] A resemblance to the eerie worlds of Swiss artist H.R. Giger was also recognized.[143][144] The pods can be seen in Welcome to Paradox Episode 4 \"News from D Street\" from a 1986 short story[145] of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998, on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept. In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by \"the code man\" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making The Matrix.[146][147][148] Rainer Werner Fassbinders German TV Miniseries World on a Wire from 1973, an adaption of the novel Simulacron-3, served as inspirational source for some details of The Matrix, such as the transfer between the real world and the Matrix-simulation via telephone / phonebooth.[citation needed] Reviewers have also commented on similarities between The Matrix and other late-1990s films such as Strange Days, Dark City and The Truman Show.[118][149][150][151][152] The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.[153] The action scenes of The Matrix were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo.[154] The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.[155][156]\n\nThe Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as Ninja Scroll and Akira.[157] Director Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film Ghost in the Shell was a particularly strong influence;[157] producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for The Matrix by showing him that anime and saying, \"We wanna do that for real\".[158][159] Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced Ghost in the Shell, noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, \"... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that The Matrix is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios\". He stated that since Ghost in the Shell had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a \"promotional tool\".[160]\n\n### Literary works\n\nThe film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[123] Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as \"(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen\".[161] Comparisons have also been made between The Matrix and the books of Carlos Castaneda.[162]\n\nThe Matrix belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel Neuromancer by William Gibson.[140] For example, the film's use of the term \"Matrix\" is adopted from Gibson's novel,[163] though L. P. Davies had already used the term \"Matrix\" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novel The White Room (\"It had been tried in the States some years earlier, but their 'matrix' as they called it hadn't been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place\").[164] After watching The Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was \"exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing;[140] however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer, and believed that The Matrix was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick, particularly Dick's speculative Exegesis.[140] Other writers have also commented on the similarities between The Matrix and Dick's work;[154][165][166] one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick's 1977 conference, in which he stated: \"We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs\".[167][168][169][170]\n\n### Philosophy\n\nIn The Matrix, a copy of Jean Baudrillard's philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as \"the book used to conceal disks\",[171][40] and Morpheus quotes the phrase \"desert of the real\" from it.[172] \"The book was required reading\"[171] for the actors prior to filming.[40][173] However, Baudrillard himself said that The Matrix misunderstands and distorts his work.[172][174] Some interpreters of The Matrix mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim \"that the [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries\".[171] The influence of The Matrixial Gaze, the philosophical-psychoanalytical concept of Bracha L. Ettinger on the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra,[175][176][177] \"was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel\".[178][171] In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans's ideas on evolutionary psychology.[12]\n\nPhilosopher William Irwin suggests that the idea of the \"Matrix\" – a generated reality invented by malicious machines – is an allusion to Descartes' \"First Meditation\", and his idea of an evil demon. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.[179] The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s.[179] A connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.[32]\n\nThe philosophy of Immanuel Kant has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his Critique of Pure Reason that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.[180]\n\n### Religion and mythology\n\nAndrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ, including Neo's \"virgin birth\", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many other Christian references.[32] Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity's doctrine of the Trinity.[181] It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, \"Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?\"[182]\n\nMatrixism is a fan-based possibly satirical religion created as \"the matrix religion\".\n\n### Transgender themes\n\nYears after the release of The Matrix, both of the Wachowskis came out as transgender women.[183] The red pill has been compared with red estrogen pills.[184] Morpheus's description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, \"like a splinter in your mind\", has been compared to gender dysphoria.[184] In the original script, Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was removed.[185]\n\nIn a 2016 GLAAD Media Awards speech, Lilly Wachowski said: \"There's a critical eye being cast back on Lana and I's  [sic] work through the lens of our transness. This is a cool thing because it's an excellent reminder that art is never static.\"[186] In 2020, Lilly said The Matrix was intended as an allegory for gender transition, but that \"the corporate world wasn't ready\".[187] She said it was \"all about the desire for transformation but it was all coming from a closeted point of view\", but that she did not know \"how present my transness was in the background of my brain\" when the Wachowskis were writing it.[187] In an interview with Variety in 2020, Reeves said the idea that the Matrix was an allegory for transgender identity \"wasn't introduced to me when we started for production on the films.\"[188]\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nFollowing The Matrix, films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them.[76] The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including Max Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\".[189][190] It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels. The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times,[22] in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999),[191] Scary Movie (2000),[192] Shrek (2001),[189] Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002),[193] Lastikman (2003); Marx Reloaded in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky;[194]  and in video games such as Conker's Bad Fur Day.[195] It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air;[22] these included Charlie's Angels (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; Equilibrium (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo;[189] Night Watch (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by The Matrix and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made Wanted (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and Inception (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people's dreams by \"wiring in\". The original Tron (1982) paved the way for The Matrix, and The Matrix, in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a Tron sequel, Tron: Legacy (2010).[196] Also, the film's lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedy Awara Paagal Deewana.[197]\n\n### Choreographers and actors\n\nThe Matrix had a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by some subsequent Hollywood action films,[198] moving them towards more Eastern approaches.[32] The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in X-Men (2000)[198] and Charlie's Angels (2000),[196] and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-yan was choreographer on Daredevil (2003).[199] The Matrix's Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.[189]\n\nChad Stahelski, who had been a stunt double on The Matrix prior to directing Reeves in the John Wick series, acknowledged the film's strong influence on the Wick films,[200] and commented, \"The Matrix literally changed the industry. The influx of martial-arts choreographers and fight coordinators now make more, and are more prevalent and powerful in the industry, than stunt coordinators. The Matrix revolutionized that. Today, action movies want their big sequences designed around the fights.\"[201]\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss asserted that prior to being cast in The Matrix, she had \"no career\". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a New York Daily News interview, she stated, \"The Matrix gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much\".[202] The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since Star Wars.[22] The combined success of the Matrix trilogy, the Lord of the Rings films and the Star Wars prequels made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies.[32] Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that The Matrix's success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.[189]\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nThe Matrix was also influential for its impact on superhero films. John Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television called the film a \"revolutionary\" reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to \"make comic-book superheroes hip\" and effectively demonstrating the concept of \"faster than a speeding bullet\" with its bullet time effect.[203] Adam Sternbergh of Vulture.com credits The Matrix with reinventing and setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters, and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.[204]\n\n### Modern reception\n\nIn 2001, The Matrix placed 66th in the American Film Institute's \"100 Years...100 Thrills\" list.[205] In 2007, Entertainment Weekly called The Matrix the best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years.[10] In 2009, the film was ranked 39th on Empire's reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".[206] The Matrix was voted as the fourth best science fiction film in the 2011 list Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, based on a poll conducted by ABC and People. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"[11]\n\n### Red pill and blue pill\n\nThe premise of The Matrix has been repurposed for multiple conspiracy theories and alt-right fringe groups. For example, some online men's rights groups use the term \"redpill\" to mean men realizing that they are supposedly being subjugated by feminism.[207][208] The term has been used in discussion forums for right-wing topics such as Gamergate, white supremacy, incel subculture and QAnon.[209] As of 2021, the verb \"pill\" and suffix \"-pilled\" had entered more mainstream use and had come to mean developing a sudden interest in something.[209]\n\n### Sequels and adaptations\n\nThe film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, both directed by the Wachowskis. These were filmed back-to-back in one shoot and released on separate dates in 2003.[210] The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army.[211][212]  The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.[212][213]\n\nAlso released was The Animatrix, a collection of nine animated short films, many of which were created in the same Japanese animation style[214] that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy. The Animatrix was overseen and approved by the Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them; much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime.[214]\n\nIn March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to The Hollywood Reporter neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis.[215] On August 20, 2019, Warner Bros.

The Matrix is exactly what they pitched, but they were designing those cameras to get those freeze-frames, and I was like, \"If that doesn't work, the movie looks ridiculous.\" I didn't feel comfortable with the level of importance placed on that effect working properly. ... That's probably the only one that I turned down that I shouldn't have, but when you see somebody do it like Keanu you think, \"Thank God.\" I don't think I was mature enough as an actor at that point to get out of the way and just let it be and allow the directors to make the movie. I would have been trying to make jokes. Now I would have loved to take a shot and see what I would have done with it and I know now I could absolutely have been mature enough to get out the way.

Warner Bros. was going for this thing where they didn't want Johnny Depp, they wanted Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer. They told Larry and Andy if Brad Pitt would do the picture, they'd green light it right then. After Kilmer and Brad Pitt said no, Warner Bros. was willing to consider Johnny Depp, so it sort of came down to between Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves, who Warner Bros. was pushing. Keanu was always really tuned in to the concept and that made a big difference for Larry and Andy. I think it was a brilliant choice. Gary Oldman was considered as Morpheus at one point, and Samuel Jackson as well. For Trinity, I think they were generally looking at lesser known names for that character.\n- ^ a b Williams, Trey (March 26, 2019). \"'The Matrix' Wanted Sandra Bullock as Neo Before Keanu Reeves Took the Role\".

In fact, while we’re on the subject, another thing that really gets on my cinematic tits are movies featuring impassive-faced heroes pulling off ludicrous gymnastics that choked up the blockbuster scene in the wake of The Matrix.\nSo you can imagine how stoked I must have been when trying to stir up enthusiasm to make it through Æon Flux, a relentlessly awful adaptation of the MTV animated series of the same name that spends the entirety of its runtime doing everything in its power to make you hate it with the fire of a thousand suns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2011, 99% of the world’s population bit the big one after a lethal pathogen ravaged the earth and after the survivors regrouped, they tried to rebuild civilisation as they knew it.\nBy 2415, humans, numbering a mere five million, havecall gathered to live within the walled city-state known as Bregna which is run by a Congress of scientist and although the place is kind of nice for a dystopian city located on an inhospitable earth, there are numerous reports of mysterious disappearances and the population is plagued by nightmares. Talk about clouds and silver linings, eh?\nBecause this is a future dystopian movie and future dystopian movies always have a underground resistance, we meet Æon Flux, a cat-suited warrior for the rebel organisation known as the Monicans, whose successful mission to take out a surveillance station is marred by the fact that her beloved sister was mistakenly murdered while under suspicion of being an agent for the resistance.\nConsumed with vengeance, Æon takes a mission to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild, but like every movie similar to this thats ever been made, not only is there a mystery villain out there pulling everybody’s strings (it’s Johnny Lee Miller, the movie doesn’t even try to hide it), but Æon has a hidden past that’s linked directly into the growing mental issues the people of Bregna are suffering from.\nGoing against the Monicans in order to unravel this mystery, Æon teams up with Goodchild in order to discover the secrets the ruling body is trying so desperately to hide.\nWhat it all actually amounts to, is a bunch of annoyingly smug fight sequences, a lot of breathy yearning between Flux and Goodchild and contrived reveal that throws clones, immortality and Pete Postlethwaite wearing something that looks like a giant paper bag, into an already irritating mix. But with the impressive amount of utter shite this movie pushes out, would not a more accurate title have been Anal Flex?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFirstly, before we get into the meat of things, I’d like you to know how impressed you all should be that I managed to jot down such an in-depth synopsis, because god knows Æon Flux certainly puts you through your paces when trying to follow its rambling plot. It’s not because its overly hard to follow (although some impressively shoddy storytelling certainly doesn’t help), but is actually so mind-numbingly fucking boring it’s virtually impossible to make it through the whole thing without feeling the mercifully urge to go for your phone, pick up a book, or emigrate to an island where no copies of Æon Flux are allowed to exist.\nI actually used to watch the animated series when in was still in it’s short film, incarnation when it was part of MTV’s Liquid Televison show back in 1991 and found it quite fun in a bizarre, avant-garde sort of way (Æon actually dies at the end of almost every episode), so when news broke of a movie, I would have slammed down a years worth of wages to bet that it was going to suck harder than experiencing explosive decompression while using the toilet on the NASA space station.\nThe movie’s first mistake (as is the norm for most Anime adaptations) is that the filmmakers try to actually cram the aesthetics of the animation into real life, meaning were stuck with emotionless lead characters who effortless slaughter scores of faceless bad guys without breaking a sweat. Firstly, do you realise how ridiculous it is to hire someone like Charlize Theron to play someone with no charisma? That’s like hiring Arnold Schwarzenegger to play a 90-pound weakling with a phobia of Austrian accents and it’s frankly frustrating to see an Oscar winner attempt the type of role Milla Jovovich and Kate Beckinsale have been coasting by in for years – but at least they managed to drag out franchises out of over-edited fight scenes and endless posing. Still, at least Theron finally nailed the female dystopian action with Mad Max: Fury Road, eh?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEven the visual style of the movie seems carefully genetically modified to get on your tits, with the movie going overboard with miraculous tech and elaborate costumes that aim for beguilingly beautiful and lands squarely on utterly ridiculous instead. While were trying not to openly smirk at Frances Mcdormand’s Handler character that has her sporting the ginger locks of Merdia from Brave and has her backlit like she’s the Virgin Mary, we’re also supposed to think that the sight of Sophie Okonedo with hands for feet isn’t the stupidest fucking thing you’ve ever seen. Add to that a bunch of weird, trippy technology like killer grass, dart shooting hornet nests and a telepathy inducing pill that you activate by swallowing it (bit awkward if you mistake it for a suppository, I suppose) and you have a visual farce that feels like the only aspect of the film that wasn’t overthought was the script.\nOnce again, we have yet another Anime adaptation that misses the point by a country mile thanks to filmmakers not realising that live action and animated sci-fi is sometimes utterly incompatible and the visual flare that comes across as so stunning in one form can be unintentionally hilarious in the other. One the other hand, it does nail the bit in the cartoon where she catches a fly with her eyelashes – although in reality it would probably give her pink eye…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver-produced, under-written, horribly directed (by Girlfight helmer Karyn Kusama no less) and sketchily performed by a cast who plainly have no idea what’s going on, I don’t know whether this movie is a victim of studio tampering or simply incompetence – but one thing I do know? Æon sucks.\n\n🌟\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Nextdoor (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n- Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n## Post navigation\n\n### Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nΔ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Trending Now\n\n- The Electric State (2025) - Review\n- The Shrouds - Official Trailer\n- Fight Or Flight (2024) - Review\n- The Life Of Chuck - Official Teaser Trailer\n- Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) - Review\n- Creepshow - Season 1, Episode 3: All Hallows Eve/The Man In The Suitcase (2019) - Review\n- Daredevil - Season 2, Episode 8: Guilty As Sin (2016) - Review\n- Daredevil - Season 2, Episode 9: Seven Minutes In Heaven (2016) - Review\n- Fallout - Season 1, Episode 8: The Beginning (2024) - Review\n- Agatha All Along - Season 1, Episode 9: Maiden Mother Crone (2024) - Review\n\n### Join the fun on facebook\n\n- Home\n- News\n- Trailers\n- Film Reviews\n- Television Reviews\n- Top 5\n- Rankings\n- Contact Us\n- Donate\n\n.\n\n- Comment\n- Subscribe Subscribed\n    - We Have Issues\n    - Join 313 other subscribers\n    - Already have a WordPress.com account?

such an original movie, that it has its own time-period, its own, unique noir environment, and its own depressed, violent, hard-boiled characters.  The movie moves through its events like flipping through a tabloid, and I have no doubt that Frank Miller earned his director screen-credit because his work is essentially the film’s storyboard.  The visual style of the movie inspires and catches the eye, but also horrifies us with its dark, rated-R secrets.  We will see Thursday the 21st if A Dame to Kill For (2014) can match the high-bar of style set by Sin City.\n\nThe world of Sin City is completely unique, because there is no place on Earth quite like it.  I mean, it reminds me of New York or Chicago, but there are places and things in the movie out of the 30s or 40s.  There are also Ferraris on the road, so I’m not sure what time period they were going for, if any.  In some ways, the city embodies the people in it: sad and depressed.  And if the characters aren’t sad and depressed, they are violent and depressed.  There’s more hard-boiled moodiness in this movie than all the Humphrey Bogart movies put together.\n\nMuch like other serials, Sin City the comic spanned many pages, so there was a lot of source material to draw from for this movie.  The sequel to this movie is A Dame To Kill For (2014), which is based on the same Sin City limited series.  However, it has other material added to the movie, and is structured in an episodic way like the original Sin City.  It should be interesting to compare the two.\n\nI have no explanation how Bruce Willis will appear in the sequel to Sin City, but it will no doubt be in a flashback or as a hallucination.  He was the best actor in the first film and that was a good choice by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller.\n\nMickey Rourke plays Marv and I barely recognize him in Sin City.  His acting is brilliant.  The pace helps hide his acting weaknesses, and Rourke’s face is full of blood by the thirty

The movie moves through its events like flipping through a tabloid, and I have no doubt that Frank Miller earned his director screen-credit because his work is essentially the film’s storyboard. The visual style of the movie inspires and catches the eye, but also horrifies us with its dark, rated-R secrets. We will see Thursday the 21st if A Dame to Kill For (2014) can match the high-bar of style set by Sin City.</paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>The world of Sin City is completely unique, because there is no place on Earth quite like it. I mean, it reminds me of New York or Chicago, but there are places and things in the movie out of the 30s or 40s. There are also Ferraris on the road, so I’m not sure what time period they were going for, if any. In some ways, the city embodies the people in it: sad and depressed. And if the characters aren’t sad and depressed, they are violent and depressed. There’s more hard-boiled moodiness in this movie than all the Humphrey Bogart movies put together.</paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>Much like other serials, Sin City the comic spanned many pages, so there was a lot of source material to draw from for this movie. The sequel to this movie is A Dame To Kill For (2014), which is based on the same Sin City limited series. However, it has other material added to the movie, and is structured in an episodic way like the original Sin City. It should be interesting to compare the two.</paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>I have no explanation how Bruce Willis will appear in the sequel to Sin City, but it will no doubt be in a flashback or as a hallucination. He was the best actor in the first film and that was a good choice by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller.</paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>Mickey Rourke plays Marv and I barely recognize him in Sin City. His acting is brilliant. The pace helps hide his acting weaknesses, and Rourke’s face is full of blood by the thirty minute mark. He protects women with violence and kicks in everyone’s face with honest redemption, but it is his face that always turns out for the worst. It is an amazing character drama to follow, like watching a show on HBO, but with the boring parts cut out.</paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>Clive Owen as Dwight tries his best Marv impression and it works.

On the surface, Sucker Punch is a film about women trying to break free from the structural oppression of their circumstances. What’s fascinating about Zack Snyder’s film, however, is that these women are not successful. One escapes, while three die, and the fifth is lobotomized. The fantasy action sequences that Snyder utilizes as a metaphor for the degradation of these women’s bodies through the male gaze feel futile in their cruelty. We watch a young woman visualize the sexualization of her body through these elaborate action set pieces that allow her to feel in charge of her own body, yet they all end where they started through a transition shot that can’t help but remind us of the cage she has been placed in.\n\nSnyder has described the film as his critique of geek culture, dominated by a male perspective that can only view women through the prism of its own titillation. Women hold no value if they are not performing specifically for the men that dominate these spaces. A decade later, after witnessing GamerGate and the discourse that surrounded films like Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters, Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey, and Captain Marvel that angered fanboys because the women weren’t interested in performing specifically for them, Snyder was on to something. What Snyder attempted with Sucker Punch was to tap into that very specific aspect of geek culture, and explore the toxicity of this kind of entitlement; — in essence, inviting young men to the movie by promoting it as an anime-inspired action spectacle from the director of 300, then pull the rug underneath them. Instead, they are given a film about the prison they cast upon women through the fetishization of their gaze, and how they have managed to build the structures of this geek space around their own inherent misogyny. Snyder uses this very specific lens to create parallels between the geek space and the real world, and how they mirror one another.\n\nSucker Punch opens up on a literal stage, with the Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures logos imposed upon these red curtains, that slowly open to reveal a young woman sitting on a bed facing away from us. The camera slowly churns forward, past the auditorium seats, and we find ourselves on the stage — thus the tale begins. The film, from its opening frame, makes the audience complicit in its storytelling, and the characters we are introduced to will fight tooth and nail to break free from the oppressiveness of our expectations of them, to no avail. We are introduced to Babydoll (Emily Browning) sitting on the bed with porcelain skin and a name that matches her aesthetic as she receives the news that her mother is dead. Through an exquisitely designed five-minute opening sequence, we watch Babydoll deal with the aftermath of her mother’s death as she attempts to protect her little sister from an abusive stepfather. This entire sequence is wordless, save for the voice-over from Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), and a haunting rendition of “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These),” sung by Browning herself. The music slowly overtakes the picture as the action on-screen advances, culminating in a moment where Babydoll accidentally kills her sister with a stray bullet she shot through her stepfather’s arm. She is brought to a mental institution, where she is to be lobotomized in five days, thanks to a forged signature from an orderly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is what I refer to as the first layer of the film, or the real world. Once at the institution we enter a second layer of reality, which is a brothel that helps Babydoll visualize her circumstances in a way that she can process. But more importantly, it visualizes her circumstances more succinctly for us, the audience. It is important to remember that what we are watching is taking place on a stage, and everything we see is specifically for us. While Babydoll introduces us to this brothel, where she meets up with four other women to hatch an escape plan, where she visualizes the lobotomist as a high roller buying her virginity, and where she visualizes an orderly as the man who runs the brothel; this is all for us. It is Snyder making a conscious choice to make us complicit in the dehumanization of these women, and their failure to escape lands squarely on our shoulders. We are holding them prisoner.\n\nWe are introduced to the brothel level through a transition shot from the perspective of the hammer and nail used in lobotomies. We are closed in on Babydoll’s face with the nail pointed and hammer pulled back, and then as the camera pulls back, we transition to the brothel, where Sweet Pea is on a stage, with Amber (Jaime Chung) holding the needle, imitating a doctor, and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) as her assistant. It is a clever way to switch from one reality to another, but it also allows Snyder to switch the focus of the story. Snyder draws these parallel images between Babydoll and Sweet Pea that feel purposeful, and it will all come full circle at the end. Jena Malone’s Rocket, Sweet Pea’s sister, gives Babydoll a tour of the brothel, where she explains how every girl does a dance for patrons, enticing them to spend money, while Blue (Oscar Isaac) runs the brothel. Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) is their instructor, who is in charge of putting on these shows.\n\nThe third and final layer is the fantasy action spectacle, the layer where we get to watch these women take control of their bodies and fight back against their patriarchal oppressors. We transition to this layer through the eyes of Babydoll, as she begins her titillating dance. Instead of watching her physical performance, we transition to exquisitely designed battlefields defined by a specific mission.\n\nThere are four main action set pieces. The first is Babydoll entering a dojo and being met by a character who is referred to as the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). The Wise Man provides Babydoll with a Katana before giving her a list of five items to collect: a map, fire, a knife, and a key, with the fifth item is a mysterious sacrifice. During the first action sequence, where Babydoll is given the instructions to her quest by the Wise Man, she is tasked with fighting these giant samurai warriors who bleed light when you cut them. The next action set piece is set in World War II, this time with Babydoll fighting alongside Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, and Blondie. This is where they fight steampunk zombies as they trek behind enemy lines to retrieve a map. Back in the brothel, Sweet Pea sneaks into Blue’s office to steal a map of the facilities while he is distracted by Babydoll.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe next action set-piece takes place in a fantasy world where the women are dropped into the middle of waging war as they are tasked with slicing open a baby dragon’s neck and retrieving two crystals that create the most beautiful fire imaginable. Back in the brothel, while the mayor is distracted by Babydoll’s dance on stage, Amber retrieves a lighter from his breast pocket while she is sitting on his lap. The next, and final, action set-piece takes place on a futuristic train, where these women fight through a horde of futuristic robots as they try to disarm a bomb before it reaches a major city. Back in the brothel, Sweet Pea is tasked with stealing a knife from the chef while he is distracted. This is where their mission fails. The radio that they were using to play music short circuits which pulls Babydoll out of the dance and pulls the chef out of his daze. He then grabs the knife they were stealing and lunges towards Sweet Pea, leading to Rocket diving in front of her sister and taking the knife right through the gut.\n\nThese action set pieces are where Snyder’s reputation as a visual stylist catches up with him as he attempts to frame the action through a metaphorical lens. Snyder creates a direct link between Babydoll’s dance for the patrons in the brothel and the way action functions as an extension of that dance, putting the audience into the position of the men who are objectifying Babydoll’s body. However, Snyder himself has a very masculine gaze as seen in his Watchmen adaptation and 300, filming action with a hyper-stylized visual aesthetic. The human body is a sculpture to Snyder, and he positions his actors within the frame as if he is creating his own Renaissance art piece.\n\nThe difference between Sucker Punch and some of his other work is the way in which he minimizes his gaze in Sucker Punch. If you look at 300, there is an eroticism to the action and every decision Snyder makes heightens that eroticism. With Sucker Punch, that eroticism is gone, and Snyder is no longer interested in the architecture of the human body. Instead, he dresses the women up in anime-like outfits and invites the audience in to impart their own gaze upon them. While Snyder is not directly sexualizing the women through his filmmaking, he is giving the audience the opportunity to do the work for him, hoping that they can connect the metaphorical dots.\n\nHowever, because he still uses slow-motion to accentuate the physicality in the performers while creating immense battle sequences that feel so elaborately draped in his specific style, the metaphor gets lost in the grandiosity of its presentation. The critical reception to the film speaks to the dissonance between intent and reception. At the beginning and end of each action set piece, Snyder brings everything full circle by reminding us of the metaphor, but in between those two points we get lost in an action spectacle to the point where it is easy to push the metaphorical significance to the back of our mind. We should not be enjoying the action, because Snyder is making it a point to show us how the action itself is a prison, and yet it is still impossible not to enjoy it because of how well-staged it is. Personally, I find his approach to be effective specifically because every time we return to the brothel after an action set piece, Snyder always reminds us not only of the danger we’ve returned to, but he also reminds us of the gaze from which we’ve been viewing these women. He is, in essence, sucker-punching us into getting lost in the action before reminding us of the dance, which reminds us of the male perspective from which we entered the action in the first place. Snyder walks a fine line in creating immersive action while never failing to remind us of the context from which the action sprouts from.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI describe the film as an anti-empowerment fantasy in the opening paragraph, which primarily has to do with the futility in the action scenes mixed with the metaphor of the audience, using us as stand-ins for those who objectify Babydoll with their gazel. The action itself is impeccably designed and crafted. And yet, there is a futility to the spectacle because Snyder always returns us to the same place: a brothel, trapped in the gaze of a male oppressor. When we watch action sequences where we are meant to root for a given character’s success, their triumph becomes our triumph. Our emotional investment in them feels like it has earned the payoff once we arrive at the conclusion. There is inherent excitement built into the genre because we do not yet know the outcome. With Sucker Punch, however, every action scene begins and ends the same way, back in the brothel. While yes, maybe Sweet Pea was able to retrieve the map from Blue’s office, or maybe Amber was able to retrieve a lighter from the mayor’s pocket while he was distracted by Babydoll, but at the end of the day, we are still stuck within this brothel with a dangerous presence lurking. The fantasy action spectacle is just that: fantasy. During the final action set piece Rocket sacrifices herself for her sister, and we cut back to the brothel to watch the slob of a chef stab Rocket as she jumps in front of Sweet Pea, it feels inevitable. Snyder was not interested in making a movie that simply gave us the instant gratification of an empowerment narrative that dissipates the second we left the theater. Sucker Punch is more of a conversation piece, drenched in a dreary atmosphere with a guttural sadness radiating from its pores. Our problems are so deeply entrenched that a simple pop culture entertainer doesn’t really matter for our collective psyche.\n\nNow the ending, which is a fascinating beast in and of itself because of the behind-the-scenes drama that forced Snyder to remove a pivotal scene in order to adhere to a PG-13 rating from the MPAA. By forcing the removal of this scene, the MPAA was the catalyst for the recontextualization of the film and the way in which our society views any form of female sexuality. The scene I am referring to is one with the Highroller (Jon Hamm) in the brothel level of the film, only available in the extended cut on home video. At this point in the film, three of the women have died and Babydoll has been captured after helping Sweet Pea escape. Babydoll’s “sacrifice” that the wise man alluded to was herself. In the theatrical version of the film, when Babydoll is captured, Snyder cuts back to the mental institution and we watch Babydoll’s lobotomy. The extended cut however has a pivotal scene with the Highroller, the man who paid a small fortune for Babydoll’s “body” —essentially her virginity. During this moment in the film, the Highroller doesn’t want to take Babydoll forcefully; he offers her a trade. He will offer Babydoll freedom, and in return he wants Babydoll to willingly give him her body. And as they begin to kiss, we cut back to the mental institution and watch Babydoll’s lobotomy.\n\nThe Highroller himself and his purpose within the larger narrative speaks on the value we put on a woman’s virginity and the purity of a woman’s body. This specific scene shows us the way in which Babydoll is contextualizing her lobotomy. To her, this will help her be free. It is in many ways a tragedy because to a woman who has been abused in the way that Babydoll has, the fact that she has to twist her lobotomy into a form of freedom is imbued with despair.\n\nThe scene and its behind-the-scenes drama also helps recontextualize the rest of the film and the way Snyder uses violence as a stand-in for the objectification of Babydoll’s body. This Highroller scene is not explicit in its sexuality. There is no vulgar language, no nudity, and no real sexual content. There is however the implication of sex, and this scene is also the only time in the film where Babydoll has control over her own sexuality, yet the scene was cut because the MPAA thought it was too suggestive. If we look at the film, and how Snyder used the action sequences as the dance for the audience, we get the feeling that if he didn’t cut to an action scene, the film would have been slapped with an R rating because the MPAA doesn’t know what to do with a woman’s sexuality. So instead of a dance, we are treated to elaborate action set pieces that include knifing through giant samurai, gunning down steampunk zombies, slitting a dragon’s throat, and fighting futuristic robots.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce we deal with the Highroller and cut back to the institution where Babydoll is lobotomized, Snyder attempts to recontextualize the entire narrative by switching protagonists. Up until this point, even though the entire film has been framed through Babydoll’s eyes, Snyder has purposefully been drawing parallels between Sweet Pea and Babydoll. The film might open with Babydoll on a stage, but it is Sweet Pea’s voice that overlays the visuals, speaking about guardian angels. When we enter the brothel, it is through the eyes of Babydoll as she is about to be lobotomized, but when the camera pulls back into the brothel it is through Sweet Pea’s eyes that we are introduced to this new world. Sweet Pea is a protective older sister who left home when her sister Rocket ran away, but she couldn’t save Rocket from the reality of the brothel, paralleling Babydoll’s own failure to protect her sister.\n\nWhen Babydoll was captured by the Highroller, she purposefully sacrificed herself, acting as a distraction for Sweet Pea’s escape. The ending, once we return to the mental institution, is where this escape comes back into play. After her lobotomy Babydoll is led through the corridors of the institution by Blue, who is just an orderly here. As she is guided by the shoulders we come to the understanding that what happened in the brothel level also happened in the institution level. We walk past a corridor that was clearly lit on fire, mirroring Babydoll lighting a fire to set off the alarms in the brothel. The chef is missing a knife as Babydoll walks past, just like she stole the knife after Rocket was killed in the brothel. We also hear Madame Gorski, who in the institution is a psychiatrist, tell the lobotomist that Babydoll helped another girl escape, alluding to Sweet Pea.\n\nThis is where we travel down two diverging roads. On one hand, we have a lobotomized Babydoll in a mental institution who is taken to a private room by Blue so he could sexually assault her. Except, because her mind has escaped and her eyes have this glossy sheen that shows how she isn’t there anymore, he gets upset and he can’t do what he wanted to do. To a man like Blue, the gratification of sexual objectification and assault comes in the form of the women struggling against the imposition of his power. To men like Blue, it’s not about sexual attraction. It’s about imposing themselves onto another being who is struggling against them and feeling the gratification that comes with wielding that power.\n\nThe second road we travel down is that of Sweet Pea who we see escape the brothel and board a bus as her voice-over asks us to reconsider who’s story this truly is. When she boards the bus, the bus driver is none other than the Wise Man who is only seen in the fantasy action sequences, alluding to how we are inside Babydoll’s head and her solace comes in the form of Sweet Pea escape. This ending is then left open to interpretation. Over the course of the movie, Snyder draws clear parallels between Babydoll and Sweet Pea, using a filmic language to create a connection between the two, which allows us to look at the ending as framing the entire film as a complete fantasy, where none of the other settings were real. The entire movie can be viewed as an exploration of trauma through the perspective of an abused young woman, and helping Sweet Pea escape at the end was this woman freeing herself of the guilt that is associated with trauma. Babydoll was described as a guardian angel in both the opening five minutes and at the end via Sweet Pea’s voiceover, recontextualizing the story as her own while she urges the audience to fight back. In this interpretation of the film, Babydoll isn’t real. She is Sweet Pea’s guardian angel, helping Sweet Pea navigate the trauma of her life while giving her the tools to fight and live. Babydoll is Sweet Pea’s defense mechanism, helping her find peace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can also view the film through a more literal lens, and Sweet Pea escaping on a bus driven by the Wise Man can be viewed as Babydoll taking solace in the fact that she helped Sweet Pea. Even though that specific detail of the bus is a fantasy as it takes place inside Babydoll’s own mind, the film makes us aware that everything Babydoll and the women did in the brothel also took place in the institution. We can draw the conclusion based on the information presented that Babydoll used the knife, fire, key, and map to hatch an escape plan, and it worked, to an extent. Whatever your interpretation of the ending, there is no denying the ending is about the emotional echoes of its despair intermingled with catharsis. What we feel matters more than what we think.\n\nSucker Punch is a film that is at war with its own ambitions. A steampunk action fantasy soaked in a feminist lens, and yet, it was made by a white male filmmaker with an overtly masculine perspective. On its surface, it is a throwback to the women-in-prison exploitation genre as a group of women attempt to break free from a cage-like structure. Underneath its skin, the prison is also metaphorical, as Snyder interrogates the male gaze and its toxic perspective on the female body. Gone are the action sequences with the eroticism of 300, as Snyder tries to mute his own masculine gaze, aware of the contradiction that arises when a male filmmaker attempts to write and direct a movie about women. Regardless of how close he comes to authenticity, he will never get there because he does not have the experience that would lend the authenticity to him, and his past history with action filmmaking created a reputation that preceded Sucker Punch. This was Snyder’s downfall, where he had so much worth saying, but the perspective he offered was in question, leading to the film being dismissed and labeled as misogynistic.\n\nWhen a movie this ambitious arrives at our doorstep with so many ideas in its head as it wrestles with its own thematic construction, it opens itself up for a fascinating conversation. I would rather we have that conversation than outright dismiss its merits. Movies are more of an emotional experience instead of a logical one, and the reason that the themes of Sucker Punch have resonated with me so much is because of the immense sadness that overtakes me as I watch it. That immense sadness offers me the opportunity to explore the movie on a deeper level. It was through that emotional rabbit hole where I discovered my love for the film. I don’t think it’s possible to watch the movie and not be overtaken by an emotional response, whether that response is a negative or positive reaction to the film itself, and whether your own emotional rabbit hole leaves you loving or hating the end result. Do I think Sucker Punch is a misunderstood masterpiece? No, because I don’t need everyone to look at the film through my own specific lens. However, I do feel like we owe the film a re-examination, through the context that time provides, separated from its initial reputation.\n\n- Sucker Punch\n- Zack Snyder\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWriter\n\n- Twitter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### SXSW Review: ‘Broadcast Signal Intrusion’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Faith and Judgment in ‘The Exorcism of Emily Rose’\n\n#### You may also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade and What it Means to Feel Shame\n\nFeelings of shame have always been tightly bound to my soul and I ...\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### An Adaptation Come True: The Real Annabeth Chase\n\nWhen the cast for the new Disney+ Percy Jackson and the Olympians series ...\n\nComments are closed.\n\n#### More in Features\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Did Gen Z Kill the ‘Mean Girl’?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### “A Modern Horror Film” — The Enduring Unease of ‘The Conversation’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### A Coming of Age: ‘Freaks and Geeks,’ and Storytelling Through Music\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### In ‘American Fiction’ and ‘Shortcomings,’ Race is Only Half the Story\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Fantastic Fest Review: ‘Animale’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Fantastic Fest Review: ‘Will &amp; Harper’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Fantastic Fest Review: ‘Apartment 7A’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFilm Cred © 2022\n\n- About\n- Contact\n- Thank You\n- Archive\n- Privacy Policy\n- Return &amp;amp; Refund Policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Features end 0 Close atbssuga-menu\\_\\_inner Close atbssuga-menu\n    - Interviews\n    - TV\n    - Podcasts\n    - Video Essays\n- Reviews end 0 Close atbssuga-menu\\_\\_inner Close atbssuga-menu\n    - Film Festivals\n- Advice\n- About end 0 Close atbssuga-menu\\_\\_inner Close atbssuga-menu\n    - Staff\n    - Thank You\n- Zine\n- Shop\n- Patreon\n- Contact\n\n##\n\n- Features\n    - Interviews\n    - TV\n    - Podcasts\n    - Video Essays\n- Reviews\n    - Film Festivals\n- Advice\n- About\n    - Staff\n    - Thank You\n- Zine\n- Shop\n- Patreon\n- Contact\n\n## Latest Posts\n\n### Fantastic Fest Review: ‘Animale’\n\n### Fantastic Fest Review: ‘Will &amp; Harper’\n\n### Fantastic Fest Review: ‘Apartment 7A’",

On the surface, <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> is a film about women trying to break free from the structural oppression of their circumstances. What’s fascinating about <Director>Zack Snyder</Director>’s film, however, is that these women are not successful. One escapes, while three die, and the fifth is lobotomized. The fantasy action sequences that <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> utilizes as a metaphor for the degradation of these women’s bodies through the male gaze feel futile in their cruelty. We watch a young woman visualize the sexualization of her body through these elaborate action set pieces that allow her to feel in charge of her own body, yet they all end where they started through a transition shot that can’t help but remind us of the cage she has been placed in.\n\n        <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> has described the film as his critique of geek culture, dominated by a male perspective that can only view women through the prism of its own titillation. Women hold no value if they are not performing specifically for the men that dominate these spaces. A decade later, after witnessing GamerGate and the discourse that surrounded films like Paul Feig’s Ghostbusters, Cathy Yan’s Birds of Prey, and Captain Marvel that angered fanboys because the women weren’t interested in performing specifically for them, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> was on to something. What <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> attempted with <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> was to tap into that very specific aspect of geek culture, and explore the toxicity of this kind of entitlement; — in essence, inviting young men to the movie by promoting it as an anime-inspired action spectacle from the director of 300, then pull the rug underneath them. Instead, they are given a film about the prison they cast upon women through the fetishization of their gaze, and how they have managed to build the structures of this geek space around their own inherent misogyny. <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> uses this very specific lens to create parallels between the geek space and the real world, and how they mirror one another.\n\n        <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> opens up on a literal stage, with the Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures logos imposed upon these red curtains, that slowly open to reveal a young woman sitting on a bed facing away from us. The camera slowly churns forward, past the auditorium seats, and we find ourselves on the stage — thus the tale begins. The film, from its opening frame, makes the audience complicit in its storytelling, and the characters we are introduced to will fight tooth and nail to break free from the oppressiveness of our expectations of them, to no avail. We are introduced to <MainCharacters>Babydoll (Emily Browning)</MainCharacters> sitting on the bed with porcelain skin and a name that matches her aesthetic as she receives the news that her mother is dead. Through an exquisitely designed five-minute opening sequence, we watch <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> deal with the aftermath of her mother’s death as she attempts to protect her little sister from an abusive stepfather. This entire sequence is wordless, save for the voice-over from <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish)</MainCharacters>, and a haunting rendition of “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These),” sung by <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> herself. The music slowly overtakes the picture as the action on-screen advances, culminating in a moment where <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> accidentally kills her sister with a stray bullet she shot through her stepfather’s arm. She is brought to a mental institution, where she is to be lobotomized in five days, thanks to a forged signature from an orderly.\n\n        This is what I refer to as the first layer of the film, or the real world. Once at the institution we enter a second layer of reality, which is a brothel that helps <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> visualize her circumstances in a way that she can process. But more importantly, it visualizes her circumstances more succinctly for us, the audience. It is important to remember that what we are watching is taking place on a stage, and everything we see is specifically for us. While <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> introduces us to this brothel, where she meets up with four other women to hatch an escape plan, where she visualizes the lobotomist as a high roller buying her virginity, and where she visualizes an orderly as the man who runs the brothel; this is all for us. It is <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> making a conscious choice to make us complicit in the dehumanization of these women, and their failure to escape lands squarely on our shoulders. We are holding them prisoner.\n\n        We are introduced to the brothel level through a transition shot from the perspective of the hammer and nail used in lobotomies. We are closed in on <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s face with the nail pointed and hammer pulled back, and then as the camera pulls back, we transition to the brothel, where <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> is on a stage, with <MainCharacters>Amber (Jaime Chung)</MainCharacters> holding the needle, imitating a doctor, and <MainCharacters>Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens)</MainCharacters> as her assistant. It is a clever way to switch from one reality to another, but it also allows <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> to switch the focus of the story. <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> draws these parallel images between <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> and <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> that feel purposeful, and it will all come full circle at the end. <MainCharacters>Jena Malone’s Rocket</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s sister, gives <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> a tour of the brothel, where she explains how every girl does a dance for patrons, enticing them to spend money, while <MainCharacters>Blue (Oscar Isaac)</MainCharacters> runs the brothel. <MainCharacters>Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino)</MainCharacters> is their instructor, who is in charge of putting on these shows.\n\n        The third and final layer is the fantasy action spectacle, the layer where we get to watch these women take control of their bodies and fight back against their patriarchal oppressors. We transition to this layer through the eyes of <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>, as she begins her titillating dance. Instead of watching her physical performance, we transition to exquisitely designed battlefields defined by a specific mission.\n\n        There are four main action set pieces. The first is <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> entering a dojo and being met by a character who is referred to as the <MainCharacters>Wise Man (Scott Glenn)</MainCharacters>. The <MainCharacters>Wise Man</MainCharacters> provides <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> with a Katana before giving her a list of five items to collect: a map, fire, a knife, and a key, with the fifth item being a mysterious sacrifice. During the first action sequence, where <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> is given the instructions to her quest by the <MainCharacters>Wise Man</MainCharacters>, she is tasked with fighting these giant samurai warriors who bleed light when you cut them. The next action set piece is set in World War II, this time with <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> fighting alongside <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Amber</MainCharacters>, and <MainCharacters>Blondie</MainCharacters>. This is where they fight steampunk zombies as they trek behind enemy lines to retrieve a map. Back in the brothel, <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> sneaks into <MainCharacters>Blue</MainCharacters>’s office to steal a map of the facilities while he is distracted by <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>.\n\n        The next action set-piece takes place in a fantasy world where the women are dropped into the middle of waging war as they are tasked with slicing open a baby dragon’s neck and retrieving two crystals that create the most beautiful fire imaginable. Back in the brothel, while the mayor is distracted by <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s dance on stage, <MainCharacters>Amber</MainCharacters> retrieves a lighter from his breast pocket while she is sitting on his lap. The next, and final, action set-piece takes place on a futuristic train, where these women fight through a horde of futuristic robots as they try to disarm a bomb before it reaches a major city. Back in the brothel, <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> is tasked with stealing a knife from the chef while he is distracted. This is where their mission fails. The radio that they were using to play music short circuits which pulls <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> out of the dance and pulls the chef out of his daze. He then grabs the knife they were stealing and lunges towards <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>, leading to <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters> diving in front of her sister and taking the knife right through the gut.\n\n        These action set pieces are where <Director>Zack Snyder</Director>’s reputation as a visual stylist catches up with him as he attempts to frame the action through a metaphorical lens. <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> creates a direct link between <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s dance for the patrons in the brothel and the way action functions as an extension of that dance, putting the audience into the position of the men who are objectifying <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s body. However, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> himself has a very masculine gaze as seen in his Watchmen adaptation and 300, filming action with a hyper-stylized visual aesthetic. The human body is a sculpture to <Director>Zack Snyder</Director>, and he positions his actors within the frame as if he is creating his own Renaissance art piece.\n\n        The difference between <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> and some of his other work is the way in which he minimizes his gaze in <Name>Sucker Punch</Name>. If you look at 300, there is an eroticism to the action and every decision <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> makes heightens that eroticism. With <Name>Sucker Punch</Name>, that eroticism is gone, and <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> is no longer interested in the architecture of the human body. Instead, he dresses the women up in anime-like outfits and invites the audience in to impart their own gaze upon them. While <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> is not directly sexualizing the women through his filmmaking, he is giving the audience the opportunity to do the work for him, hoping that they can connect the metaphorical dots.\n\n        However, because he still uses slow-motion to accentuate the physicality in the performers while creating immense battle sequences that feel so elaborately draped in his specific style, the metaphor gets lost in the grandiosity of its presentation. The critical reception to the film speaks to the dissonance between intent and reception. At the beginning and end of each action set piece, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> brings everything full circle by reminding us of the metaphor, but in between those two points we get lost in an action spectacle to the point where it is easy to push the metaphorical significance to the back of our mind. We should not be enjoying the action, because <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> is making it a point to show us how the action itself is a prison, and yet it is still impossible not to enjoy it because of how well-staged it is. Personally, I find his approach to be effective specifically because every time we return to the brothel after an action set piece, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> always reminds us not only of the danger we’ve returned to, but he also reminds us of the gaze from which we’ve been viewing these women. He is, in essence, sucker-punching us into getting lost in the action before reminding us of the dance, which reminds us of the male perspective from which we entered the action in the first place. <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> walks a fine line in creating immersive action while never failing to remind us of the context from which the action sprouts from.\n\n        I describe the film as an anti-empowerment fantasy in the opening paragraph, which primarily has to do with the futility in the action scenes mixed with the metaphor of the audience, using us as stand-ins for those who objectify <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> with their gaze. The action itself is impeccably designed and crafted. And yet, there is a futility to the spectacle because <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> always returns us to the same place: a brothel, trapped in the gaze of a male oppressor. When we watch action sequences where we are meant to root for a given character’s success, their triumph becomes our triumph. Our emotional investment in them feels like it has earned the payoff once we arrive at the conclusion. There is inherent excitement built into the genre because we do not yet know the outcome. With <Name>Sucker Punch</Name>, however, every action scene begins and ends the same way, back in the brothel. While yes, maybe <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> was able to retrieve the map from <MainCharacters>Blue</MainCharacters>’s office, or maybe <MainCharacters>Amber</MainCharacters> was able to retrieve a lighter from the mayor’s pocket while he was distracted by <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>, but at the end of the day, we are still stuck within this brothel with a dangerous presence lurking. The fantasy action spectacle is just that: fantasy. During the final action set piece <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters> sacrifices herself for her sister, and we cut back to the brothel to watch the slob of a chef stab <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters> as she jumps in front of <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>, it feels inevitable. <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> was not interested in making a movie that simply gave us the instant gratification of an empowerment narrative that dissipates the second we left the theater. <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> is more of a conversation piece, drenched in a dreary atmosphere with a guttural sadness radiating from its pores. Our problems are so deeply entrenched that a simple pop culture entertainer doesn’t really matter for our collective psyche.\n\n        Now the ending, which is a fascinating beast in and of itself because of the behind-the-scenes drama that forced <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> to remove a pivotal scene in order to adhere to a PG-13 rating from the MPAA. By forcing the removal of this scene, the MPAA was the catalyst for the recontextualization of the film and the way in which our society views any form of female sexuality. The scene I am referring to is one with the <MainCharacters>Highroller (Jon Hamm)</MainCharacters> in the brothel level of the film, only available in the extended cut on home video. At this point in the film, three of the women have died and <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> has been captured after helping <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> escape. <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s “sacrifice” that the <MainCharacters>Wise Man</MainCharacters> alluded to was herself. In the theatrical version of the film, when <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> is captured, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> cuts back to the mental institution and we watch <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s lobotomy. The extended cut however has a pivotal scene with the <MainCharacters>Highroller</MainCharacters>, the man who paid a small fortune for <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s “body” —essentially her virginity. During this moment in the film, the <MainCharacters>Highroller</MainCharacters> doesn’t want to take <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> forcefully; he offers her a trade. He will offer <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> freedom, and in return he wants <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> to willingly give him her body. And as they begin to kiss, we cut back to the mental institution and watch <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s lobotomy.\n\n        The <MainCharacters>Highroller</MainCharacters> himself and his purpose within the larger narrative speaks on the value we put on a woman’s virginity and the purity of a woman’s body. This specific scene shows us the way in which <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> is contextualizing her lobotomy. To her, this will help her be free. It is in many ways a tragedy because to a woman who has been abused in the way that <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> has, the fact that she has to twist her lobotomy into a form of freedom is imbued with despair.\n\n        The scene and its behind-the-scenes drama also helps recontextualize the rest of the film and the way <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> uses violence as a stand-in for the objectification of <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s body. This <MainCharacters>Highroller</MainCharacters> scene is not explicit in its sexuality. There is no vulgar language, no nudity, and no real sexual content. There is however the implication of sex, and this scene is also the only time in the film where <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> has control over her own sexuality, yet the scene was cut because the MPAA thought it was too suggestive. If we look at the film, and how <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> used the action sequences as the dance for the audience, we get the feeling that if he didn’t cut to an action scene, the film would have been slapped with an R rating because the MPAA doesn’t know what to do with a woman’s sexuality. So instead of a dance, we are treated to elaborate action set pieces that include knifing through giant samurai, gunning down steampunk zombies, slitting a dragon’s throat, and fighting futuristic robots.\n\n        Once we deal with the <MainCharacters>Highroller</MainCharacters> and cut back to the institution where <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> is lobotomized, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> attempts to recontextualize the entire narrative by switching protagonists. Up until this point, even though the entire film has been framed through <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s eyes, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> has purposefully been drawing parallels between <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> and <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>. The film might open with <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> on a stage, but it is <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s voice that overlays the visuals, speaking about guardian angels. When we enter the brothel, it is through the eyes of <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> as she is about to be lobotomized, but when the camera pulls back into the brothel it is through <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s eyes that we are introduced to this new world. <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> is a protective older sister who left home when her sister <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters> ran away, but she couldn’t save <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters> from the reality of the brothel, paralleling <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s own failure to protect her sister.\n\n        When <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> was captured by the <MainCharacters>Highroller</MainCharacters>, she purposefully sacrificed herself, acting as a distraction for <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s escape. The ending, once we return to the mental institution, is where this escape comes back into play. After her lobotomy <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> is led through the corridors of the institution by <MainCharacters>Blue</MainCharacters>, who is just an orderly here. As she is guided by the shoulders we come to the understanding that what happened in the brothel level also happened in the institution level. We walk past a corridor that was clearly lit on fire, mirroring <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> lighting a fire to set off the alarms in the brothel. The chef is missing a knife as <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> walks past, just like she stole the knife after <MainCharacters>Rocket</MainCharacters> was killed in the brothel. We also hear <MainCharacters>Madame Gorski</MainCharacters>, who in the institution is a psychiatrist, tell the lobotomist that <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> helped another girl escape, alluding to <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>.\n\n        This is where we travel down two diverging roads. On one hand, we have a lobotomized <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> in a mental institution who is taken to a private room by <MainCharacters>Blue</MainCharacters> so he could sexually assault her. Except, because her mind has escaped and her eyes have this glossy sheen that shows how she isn’t there anymore, he gets upset and he can’t do what he wanted to do. To a man like <MainCharacters>Blue</MainCharacters>, the gratification of sexual objectification and assault comes in the form of the women struggling against the imposition of his power. To men like <MainCharacters>Blue</MainCharacters>, it’s not about sexual attraction. It’s about imposing themselves onto another being who is struggling against them and feeling the gratification that comes with wielding that power.\n\n        The second road we travel down is that of <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> who we see escape the brothel and board a bus as her voice-over asks us to reconsider who’s story this truly is. When she boards the bus, the bus driver is none other than the <MainCharacters>Wise Man</MainCharacters> who is only seen in the fantasy action sequences, alluding to how we are inside <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s head and her solace comes in the form of <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> escape. This ending is then left open to interpretation. Over the course of the movie, <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> draws clear parallels between <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> and <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>, using a filmic language to create a connection between the two, which allows us to look at the ending as framing the entire film as a complete fantasy, where none of the other settings were real. The entire movie can be viewed as an exploration of trauma through the perspective of an abused young woman, and helping <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> escape at the end was this woman freeing herself of the guilt that is associated with trauma. <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> was described as a guardian angel in both the opening five minutes and at the end via <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s voiceover, recontextualizing the story as her own while she urges the audience to fight back. In this interpretation of the film, <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> isn’t real. She is <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s guardian angel, helping <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> navigate the trauma of her life while giving her the tools to fight and live. <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> is <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>’s defense mechanism, helping her find peace.\n\n        You can also view the film through a more literal lens, and <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters> escaping on a bus driven by the <MainCharacters>Wise Man</MainCharacters> can be viewed as <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> taking solace in the fact that she helped <MainCharacters>Sweet Pea</MainCharacters>. Even though that specific detail of the bus is a fantasy as it takes place inside <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters>’s own mind, the film makes us aware that everything <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> and the women did in the brothel also took place in the institution. We can draw the conclusion based on the information presented that <MainCharacters>Babydoll</MainCharacters> used the knife, fire, key, and map to hatch an escape plan, and it worked, to an extent. Whatever your interpretation of the ending, there is no denying the ending is about the emotional echoes of its despair intermingled with catharsis. What we feel matters more than what we think.\n\n        <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> is a film that is at war with its own ambitions. A steampunk action fantasy soaked in a feminist lens, and yet, it was made by a white male filmmaker with an overtly masculine perspective. On its surface, it is a throwback to the women-in-prison exploitation genre as a group of women attempt to break free from a cage-like structure. Underneath its skin, the prison is also metaphorical, as <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> interrogates the male gaze and its toxic perspective on the female body. Gone are the action sequences with the eroticism of 300, as <Director>Zack Snyder</Director> tries to mute his own masculine gaze, aware of the contradiction that arises when a male filmmaker attempts to write and direct a movie about women. Regardless of how close he comes to authenticity, he will never get there because he does not have the experience that would lend the authenticity to him, and his past history with action filmmaking created a reputation that preceded <Name>Sucker Punch</Name>. This was <Director>Zack Snyder</Director>’s downfall, where he had so much worth saying, but the perspective he offered was in question, leading to the film being dismissed and labeled as misogynistic.\n\n        When a movie this ambitious arrives at our doorstep with so many ideas in its head as it wrestles with its own thematic construction, it opens itself up for a fascinating conversation. I would rather we have that conversation than outright dismiss its merits. Movies are more of an emotional experience instead of a logical one, and the reason that the themes of <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> have resonated with me so much is because of the immense sadness that overtakes me as I watch it. That immense sadness offers me the opportunity to explore the movie on a deeper level. It was through that emotional rabbit hole where I discovered my love for the film. I don’t think it’s possible to watch the movie and not be overtaken by an emotional response, whether that response is a negative or positive reaction to the film itself, and whether your own emotional rabbit hole leaves you loving or hating the end result. Do I think <Name>Sucker Punch</Name> is a misunderstood masterpiece? No, because I don’t need everyone to look at the film through my own specific lens. However, I do feel like we owe the film a re-examination, through the context that time provides, separated from its initial reputation.\n    </Content>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly marking the relevant attributes with XML tags, making it structured and reader-friendly.",

It stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in Victorian London who feud over a perfect teleportation illusion.\n\nThe cast also features Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Andy Serkis, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, and editor Lee Smith.\n\nThe Prestige was released on October 20, 2006 by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution through Touchstone Pictures in North America and internationally by Warner Bros. Pictures, to positive reviews and grossed $109 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1890s London, upcoming magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden become bitter rivals after Angier's wife dies during an onstage incident. Borden, who was responsible for tying the knots in the water tank trick, claims to not know which knot he tied, infuriating Angier. They go solo, and Angier re-hires the engineer, John Cutter, to help with his act. Meanwhile, Borden hires a previously unknown engineer called Bernard Fallon.\n\nWhile developing their own shows, Angier and Borden also take turns sabotaging each other. Angier loses his stage contract after Borden's distraction, while Borden loses two fingers when Angier becomes a volunteer for his bullet catch trick. Angier visits Borden's show again, but comes away surprised by Borden's debut of a new trick called the Transported Man, in which he appears to teleport. Angier is convinced the trick involves only one person, but recreates it for his act using a lookalike double, as suggested by Cutter. Despite his version being better received, Angier obsesses with Borden's secret. Borden exposes Angier's lookalike to the audience, further infuriating him.\n\nFollowing supposed clues from Borden's stolen diary, Angier arrives at Colorado Springs to meet the scientist Nikola Tesla, himself engaged in a bitter rivalry with scientist Thomas Edison. Tesla builds Angier a machine that creates a clone of its subject, but warns against its use. Nevertheless, Angier uses it for the Real Transported Man, a refined trick that brings him unprecedented recognition. Since Tesla's machine only 'clones' and does not 'transport' (as was originally intended), Angier replaces himself with a clone each night, sacrificing the original by dropping him in a water tank positioned below stage.\n\nBorden's wife Sarah commits suicide, which causes his mistress, Olivia, to leave him. Borden is left with a daughter, Jess. He sneaks under the stage at Angier's next show to learn his new secret, but is shocked to see Angier drown inside a water tank. Borden is arrested and put on trial for Angier's apparent murder. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Angier (who did not reappear that night purely to frame Borden) reverts back to his true identity as the aristocrat Lord Caldlow, to taunt Borden that he will adopt Jess. Borden gives up his secret at the prison, only to see his note torn up unread by Angier. Fallon is the last person to visit Borden at the prison, before he is taken to be executed.\n\nAngier enlists Cutter's help to destroy Tesla's machine at a theater he secretly owns. After Cutter leaves, a mysterious figure sneaks into the theater and shoots Angier. The figure is Borden, and Angier realizes the truth: \"Borden\" was an identity shared by twin brothers; while one performed, the other hid in plain sight as \"Fallon\". They both lived one half of Borden's life, never appearing in public as twins, except during the Transported Man. One brother married Sarah, while the other loved Olivia. As he dies, Angier drops an oil lamp, starting a fire in the theater.\n\nAt Angier's house, Cutter explains that the hardest and final part of any magic trick is the re-appearance, also called the 'prestige', where the magician brings back the object he made to vanish. As he demonstrates this, Borden reappears at Angier's house to take back Jess. The film ends with a shot of Angier's burning theater, the walls lined with water tanks containing the corpses of his clones.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Hugh Jackman as Robert \"The Great Danton\" Angier / Lord Caldlow, an aristocratic magician. Nolan cast Jackman, stating that Angier \"has a wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience\", a quality he believed Jackman possessed.[4] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era magician Channing Pollock.[5] Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.\n- Christian Bale as Alfred \"The Professor\" Borden / Bernard Fallon, a working-class magician. While Nolan had previously cast Bale as Batman in Batman Begins (2005), he did not consider Bale for the role of Borden until Bale contacted him about the script. Nolan subsequently believed that Bale was \"exactly right\" for the part and that it was \"unthinkable\" for anyone else to play it.[4] Nolan suggested that the actors not read the original novel, but Bale ignored the advice.[6]\n- Michael Caine as John Cutter, the stage engineer (ingenieur) who works with Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan noted that the part had been written \"before I'd ever met\" Caine.[4] Caine described Cutter as \"a teacher, a father, and a guide to Angier\". In trying to create the character's nuanced portrait, Caine altered his voice and posture.[7]\n- Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe, Angier and Borden's assistant. Nolan was \"very keen\" for Johansson to play the role, and when he met with her to discuss it, \"she just loved the character\".[4]\n- Piper Perabo as Julia McCullough, Milton the Magician's assistant and Angier's wife.\n- Rebecca Hall as Sarah Borden, Borden's wife. Hall had to relocate from North London to Los Angeles in order to shoot the film, although the film itself takes place in London.\n- David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, the real-life inventor who creates a teleportation device for Angier. For Tesla, Nolan wanted someone who was not necessarily a film star but was \"extraordinarily charismatic\". Nolan stated that Bowie \"was really the only guy I had in mind to play Tesla because his function in the story is a small but very important role\".[4] Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him no one else could possibly play the part;[8] Bowie accepted after a few minutes.[4]\n- Andy Serkis as Mr. Alley, Tesla's assistant. Serkis said he played Alley with the belief that he was \"once a corporation man who got excited by this maverick, Tesla, so jumped ship and went with the maverick\". Serkis described Alley as a \"gatekeeper\", a \"conman\", and \"a mirror image of Michael Caine's character.\" Serkis, a big fan of Bowie, said he was enjoyable to work with, describing him as \"very unassuming, very down to earth... very at ease with himself and funny.\"[9]\n- Ricky Jay as Milton the Magician, an older magician who employs Angier and Borden at the beginning of their careers. Jay and Michael Weber trained Jackman and Bale for their roles with brief instruction in various stage illusions. The magicians gave the actors limited information, allowing them to know enough to pull off a scene.[6]\n- Roger Rees as Owens, a solicitor working for Lord Caldlow.\n- W. Morgan Sheppard as Merrit, the owner of a theater where Angier initially performs.\n- Samantha Mahurin as Jess Borden, the daughter of Borden and Sarah.\n- Daniel Davis as the judge presiding over Borden's trial.\n- Chao-Li Chi as Chung Ling Soo, a Chinese magician who disguises his great physical strength by pretending to be elderly and frail in all public appearances.\n\n## Production\n\nJulian Jarrold's and Sam Mendes' producer approached Christopher Priest for an adaptation of his novel The Prestige. Priest was impressed with Christopher Nolan's films Following and Memento,[10] and subsequently, producer Valerie Dean brought the book to Nolan's attention.[11] In October 2000, Nolan traveled to the United Kingdom to publicize Memento, as Newmarket Films was having difficulty finding a United States distributor. While in London, Nolan read Priest's book and shared the story with his brother Jonathan while walking around in Highgate (a location later featured in the scene where Angier ransoms Borden's stage engineer in Highgate Cemetery). The development process for The Prestige began as a reversal of their earlier collaboration: Jonathan Nolan had pitched his initial story for Memento to his brother during a road trip.[12]\n\nA year later, the option on the book became available and was purchased by Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films.[11][12] In late 2001, Nolan became busy with the post-production of Insomnia, and asked his brother to help work on the script.[12] The writing process was a long collaboration between the Nolan brothers, occurring intermittently over a period of five years.[13] In the script, the Nolans emphasized the magic of the story through the dramatic narrative, playing down the visual depiction of stage magic. The three-act screenplay was deliberately structured around the three elements of the film's illusion: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. \"It took a long time to figure out how to achieve cinematic versions of the very literary devices that drive the intrigue of the story,\" Christopher Nolan told Variety: \"The shifting points of view, the idea of journals within journals and stories within stories. Finding the cinematic equivalents of those literary devices was very complex.\"[14] Although the film is thematically faithful to the novel, two major changes were made to the plot structure during the adaptation process: the novel's spiritualism subplot was removed, and the modern-day frame story was replaced with Borden's wait for the gallows.[11] Priest approved of the adaptation, describing it as \"an extraordinary and brilliant script, a fascinating adaptation of my novel.\"[11]\n\nThe historic Tower Theatre in Los Angeles was used as the location for the Pantages Theatre in London[15]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn early 2003, Nolan planned to direct the film before the production of Batman Begins accelerated.[6][16] Following the release of Batman Begins, Nolan started up the project again, negotiating with Jackman and Bale in October 2005.[17] Josh Hartnett pitched Nolan for a role.[18] While the screenplay was still being written, production designer Nathan Crowley began the set design process in Nolan's garage, employing a \"visual script\" consisting of scale models, images, drawings, and notes. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan finished the final shooting draft on January 13, 2006, and began production three days later on January 16. Filming ended on April 9.[19]\n\nCrowley and his crew searched Los Angeles for almost seventy locations that resembled fin de siècle London.[15] Jonathan Nolan visited Colorado Springs to research Nikola Tesla and based the electric bulb scene on actual experiments conducted by Tesla.[12] Nathan Crowley helped design the scene for Tesla's invention; It was shot in the parking lot of the Mount Wilson Observatory.[15] Influenced by a \"Victorian modernist aesthetic,\" Crowley chose four locations in the Broadway theater district in downtown Los Angeles for the film's stage magic performances: the Los Angeles Theatre, the Palace Theatre, the Los Angeles Belasco, and the Tower Theatre.[20] Crowley also turned a portion of the Universal back lot into Victorian London.[21] Osgood Castle in Colorado was also used as a location.[22]\n\nNolan built only one set for the film, an \"under-the-stage section that houses the machinery that makes the larger illusions work,\"[23] preferring to simply dress various Los Angeles locations and sound stages to stand in for Colorado and Victorian England.[24] In contrast to most period pieces, Nolan kept up the quick pace of production by shooting with handheld cameras,[24] and refrained from using artificial lighting in some scenes, relying instead on natural light on location.[6] Costume designer Joan Bergin chose attractive, modern Victorian fashions for Scarlett Johansson; cinematographer Wally Pfister captured the mood with soft earth tones as white and black colors provided background contrasts, bringing actors' faces to the foreground.[25]  Editing, scoring, and mixing finished on September 22, 2006.[19]\n\n## Themes\n\nThe rivalry between Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him Cutter's friendship while providing him with a collection of his own dead clones; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's love because of their inhumanity. Finally, Borden is hanged and the last copy of Angier shot. Their struggle is also expressed through class warfare: Borden as The Professor, a working-class magician who gets his hands dirty, versus Angier as The Great Danton, a classy, elitist showman whose accent makes him appear American.[26] Film critic Matt Brunson claimed that a complex theme of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film chooses not to depict either magician as good or evil.[27]\n\nAngier's theft of Borden's teleportation illusion in the film echoes many real-world examples of stolen tricks among magicians. Outside the film, similar rivalries include magicians John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Kellar's dispute over a levitation illusion.[28] Gary Westfahl of Locus Online also notes a \"new proclivity for mayhem\" in the film over the novel, citing the murder/suicide disposition of Angier's duplicates and intensified violent acts of revenge and counter-revenge. This \"relates to a more general alteration in the events and tone of the film\" rather than significantly changing the underlying themes.[29]\n\nNor is this theme of cutthroat competition limited to sleight of hand: the script incorporates the popular notion that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were directly engaged in the war of the currents, a rivalry over electrical standards, which appears in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's competition for magical supremacy.[30][31] In the novel, Tesla and Edison serve as foils for Angier and Borden, respectively.[32]\n\nDen Shewman of Creative Screenwriting says the film asks how far one would go to devote oneself to an art. The character of Chung Ling Soo, according to Shewman, is a metaphor for this theme.[11] Film critic Alex Manugian refers to this theme as the \"meaning of commitment.\"[33]\n\nNicolas Rapold of Film Comment addresses the points raised by Shewman and Manugian in terms of the film's \"refracted take on Romanticism\":\n\nAngier's technological solution—which suggests art as a sacrifice, a phoenix-like death of the self—and Borden's more meat-and-potatoes form of stagecraft embodies the divide between the artist and the social being.[34]\n\nFor Manugian the central theme is \"obsession,\" but he also notes the supporting themes of the \"nature of deceit\" and \"science as magic.\" Manugian criticizes the Nolans for trying to \"ram too many themes into the story.\"[33]\n\n## Release\n\nTouchstone Pictures opted to move the release date forward by a week, from the original October 27, to October 20, 2006.[35] The film earned $14.8 million on opening weekend in the United States, debuting at #1. It grossed $109 million worldwide, including $53 million from the United States.[3] The film received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Nathan Crowley and Julie Ochipinti) and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Wally Pfister),[36] as well as a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007.[37] The film was also nominated for both Best Science Fiction Film and Best Costume Design the Saturn Awards.[38]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Full of twists and turns, The Prestige is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience.\"[39] Metacritic  assigned the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[41]\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today described the film as \"one of the most innovative, twisting, turning art films of the past decade.\"[42] Drew McWeeny gave the film a glowing review, saying it demands repeat viewing,[43] with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone agreeing.[44] On At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper, Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating.[45][46] Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Jackman and Bale whilst praising Nolan for making \"this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades.\"[47] CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it among his best films of 2006.[48] Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.[49]\n\nOn the other hand, Dennis Harvey of Variety criticized the film as gimmicky, though he felt the cast did well in underwritten roles.[50] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter felt that characters \"...are little more than sketches. Remove their obsessions, and the two magicians have little personality.\"[51] Nonetheless, the two reviewers praised David Bowie as Tesla, as well as the production values and cinematography. On a simpler note, Emanuel Levy has said: \"Whether viewers perceive The Prestige as intricately complex or just unnecessarily complicated would depend to a large degree on their willingness to suspend disbelief for two hours.\" He gave the film a B grade.[52]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing the revelation at the end as a \"fundamental flaw\" and a \"cheat.\" He wrote, \"The pledge of Nolan's The Prestige is that the film, having been metaphorically sawed in two, will be restored; it fails when it cheats, as, for example, if the whole woman produced on the stage were not the same one so unfortunately cut in two.\"[53] R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, \"I love a good science fiction story; just tell me in advance.\" He gave the film a B−.[54] Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was \"'Well, holy shit.' I was thinking, 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.'\"[55]\n\nThe film has grown in stature since its release.[56][57][58] In 2009, The A.V. Club named The Prestige as one of the best films of the 2000s.[59] The film was included in American Cinematographer's \"Best-Shot Film of 1998-2008\" list, ranking at 36. More than 17,000 people around the world participated in the final vote.[60] In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it among \"The 100 Greatest Movies Of The 21st Century\".[61]\n\n### Music\n\nThe film score was written by English musician and composer David Julyan. Julyan had previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on Following, Memento and Insomnia. Following the film's narrative, the soundtrack had three sections: the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige.[62]\n\nAll music is composed by David Julyan\n\n|   No. | Title                                 | Length   |\n|-------|---------------------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Are You Watching Closely?\"           | 1:51     |\n|     2 | \"Colorado Springs\"                    | 4:15     |\n|     3 | \"The Light Field\"                     | 1:50     |\n|     4 | \"Borden Meets Sarah\"                  | 2:11     |\n|     5 | \"Adagio for Julia\"                    | 2:03     |\n|     6 | \"A New Trick\"                         | 4:29     |\n|     7 | \"The Journal\"                         | 2:55     |\n|     8 | \"The Transported Man\"                 | 2:36     |\n|     9 | \"No, Not Today\"                       | 2:31     |\n|    10 | \"Caught\"                              | 1:39     |\n|    11 | \"Cutter Returns\"                      | 2:13     |\n|    12 | \"The Real Transported Man\"            | 2:28     |\n|    13 | \"Man's Reach Exceeds His Imagination\" | 2:08     |\n|    14 | \"Goodbye to Jess\"                     | 2:53     |\n|    15 | \"Sacrifice\"                           | 5:15     |\n|    16 | \"The Price of a Good Trick\"           | 5:05     |\n|    17 | \"The Prestige\"                        | 1:40     |\n|    18 | \"The Tesla\"                           | 1:30     |\n\nSome critics were disappointed with the score, acknowledging that while it worked within the context of the film, it was not enjoyable by itself.[63][64] Jonathan Jarry of SoundtrackNet described the score as \"merely functional,\" establishing the atmosphere of dread but never taking over. Although the reviewer was interested in the score's notion, Jarry found the execution was \"extremely disappointing.\"[63]\n\nChristopher Coleman of Tracksounds felt that though it was \"...a perfectly fitting score,\" it was completely overwhelmed by the film, and totally unnoticed at times.[64] Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks recommended the soundtrack for those who enjoyed Julyan's work on the film, and noted that it was not for those who expected \"any semblance of intellect or enchantment in the score to match the story of the film.\" Clemmensen called the score lifeless, \"constructed on a bed of simplistic string chords and dull electronic soundscapes.\"[65]\n\nThe song \"Analyse\" by Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke is played over the credits.[66]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Region 1 disc is by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, and was released on February 20, 2007, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray formats.[67] The Warner Bros. Region 2 DVD was released on March 12, 2007.[68] It is also available in both BD and regionless HD DVD in Europe (before HD DVD was canceled). Special features are minimal, with the documentary Director's Notebook: The Prestige – Five Making-of Featurettes, running roughly twenty minutes combined, an art gallery and the trailer. Nolan did not contribute to a commentary as he felt the film primarily relied on an audience's reaction and did not want to remove the mystery from the story.[69]\n\nThe film was released by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 18, 2017, in the United Kingdom.[70] The film was also released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 19, 2017, in the United States.[71]\n\n## See also\n\n- Ship of Theseus – Thought experiment about identity over time\n- Teletransportation paradox – Thought experiment on the philosophy of identity\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The Prestige\".

It stars <MainCharacters>Hugh Jackman</MainCharacters> as <MainCharacters>Robert Angier</MainCharacters> and <MainCharacters>Christian Bale</MainCharacters> as <MainCharacters>Alfred Borden</MainCharacters>, rival stage magicians in Victorian London who feud over a perfect teleportation illusion.\n\nThe cast also features <MainCharacters>Michael Caine</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Scarlett Johansson</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Rebecca Hall</MainCharacters>, <MainCharacters>Andy Serkis</MainCharacters>, and <MainCharacters>David Bowie</MainCharacters> as <MainCharacters>Nikola Tesla</MainCharacters>. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, and editor Lee Smith.\n\nThe Prestige was released on <ReleaseYear>October 20, 2006</ReleaseYear> by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution through Touchstone Pictures in North America and internationally by Warner Bros. Pictures, to positive reviews and grossed <AdditionalInformation> $109 million worldwide against a production budget of $40 million</AdditionalInformation>. It received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1890s London, upcoming magicians <MainCharacters>Robert Angier</MainCharacters> and <MainCharacters>Alfred Borden</MainCharacters> become bitter rivals after Angier's wife dies during an onstage incident. Borden, who was responsible for tying the knots in the water tank trick, claims to not know which knot he tied, infuriating Angier. They go solo, and Angier re-hires the engineer, <MainCharacters>John Cutter</MainCharacters>, to help with his act. Meanwhile, Borden hires a previously unknown engineer called Bernard Fallon.\n\nWhile developing their own shows, Angier and Borden also take turns sabotaging each other. Angier loses his stage contract after Borden's distraction, while Borden loses two fingers when Angier becomes a volunteer for his bullet catch trick. Angier visits Borden's show again, but comes away surprised by Borden's debut of a new trick called the Transported Man, in which he appears to teleport. Angier is convinced the trick involves only one person, but recreates it for his act using a lookalike double, as suggested by Cutter. Despite his version being better received, Angier obsesses with Borden's secret. Borden exposes Angier's lookalike to the audience, further infuriating him.\n\nFollowing supposed clues from Borden's stolen diary, Angier arrives at Colorado Springs to meet the scientist <MainCharacters>Nikola Tesla</MainCharacters>, himself engaged in a bitter rivalry with scientist Thomas Edison. Tesla builds Angier a machine that creates a clone of its subject, but warns against its use. Nevertheless, Angier uses it for the Real Transported Man, a refined trick that brings him unprecedented recognition. Since Tesla's machine only 'clones' and does not 'transport' (as was originally intended), Angier replaces himself with a clone each night, sacrificing the original by dropping him in a water tank positioned below stage.\n\nBorden's wife Sarah commits suicide, which causes his mistress, Olivia, to leave him. Borden is left with a daughter, Jess. He sneaks under the stage at Angier's next show to learn his new secret, but is shocked to see Angier drown inside a water tank. Borden is arrested and put on trial for Angier's apparent murder. He is found guilty and sentenced to death. Angier (who did not reappear that night purely to frame Borden) reverts back to his true identity as the aristocrat Lord Caldlow, to taunt Borden that he will adopt Jess. Borden gives up his secret at the prison, only to see his note torn up unread by Angier. Fallon is the last person to visit Borden at the prison, before he is taken to be executed.\n\nAngier enlists Cutter's help to destroy Tesla's machine at a theater he secretly owns. After Cutter leaves, a mysterious figure sneaks into the theater and shoots Angier. The figure is Borden, and Angier realizes the truth: \"Borden\" was an identity shared by twin brothers; while one performed, the other hid in plain sight as \"Fallon\". They both lived one half of Borden's life, never appearing in public as twins, except during the Transported Man. One brother married Sarah, while the other loved Olivia. As he dies, Angier drops an oil lamp, starting a fire in the theater.\n\nAt Angier's house, Cutter explains that the hardest and final part of any magic trick is the re-appearance, also called the 'prestige', where the magician brings back the object he made to vanish. As he demonstrates this, Borden reappears at Angier's house to take back Jess. The film ends with a shot of Angier's burning theater, the walls lined with water tanks containing the corpses of his clones.\n\n## Themes\n\nThe rivalry between Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him Cutter's friendship while providing him with a collection of his own dead clones; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's love because of their inhumanity. Finally, Borden is hanged and the last copy of Angier shot. Their struggle is also expressed through class warfare: Borden as The Professor, a working-class magician who gets his hands dirty, versus Angier as The Great Danton, a classy, elitist showman whose accent makes him appear American. Film critic Matt Brunson claimed that a complex theme of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film chooses not to depict either magician as good or evil.\n\nAngier's theft of Borden's teleportation illusion in the film echoes many real-world examples of stolen tricks among magicians. Outside the film, similar rivalries include magicians John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Kellar's dispute over a levitation illusion. Gary Westfahl of Locus Online also notes a \"new proclivity for mayhem\" in the film over the novel, citing the murder/suicide disposition of Angier's duplicates and intensified violent acts of revenge and counter-revenge. This \"relates to a more general alteration in the events and tone of the film\" rather than significantly changing the underlying themes.\n\nNor is this theme of cutthroat competition limited to sleight of hand: the script incorporates the popular notion that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were directly engaged in the war of the currents, a rivalry over electrical standards, which appears in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's competition for magical supremacy. In the novel, Tesla and Edison serve as foils for Angier and Borden, respectively.\n\nDen Shewman of Creative Screenwriting says the film asks how far one would go to devote oneself to an art. The character of Chung Ling Soo, according to Shewman, is a metaphor for this theme. Film critic Alex Manugian refers to this theme as the \"meaning of commitment.\"\n\nNicolas Rapold of Film Comment addresses the points raised by Shewman and Manugian in terms of the film's \"refracted take on Romanticism\":\n\nAngier's technological solution—which suggests art as a sacrifice, a phoenix-like death of the self—and Borden's more meat-and-potatoes form of stagecraft embodies the divide between the artist and the social being.\n\nFor Manugian the central theme is \"obsession,\" but he also notes the supporting themes of the \"nature of deceit\" and \"science as magic.\" Manugian criticizes the Nolans for trying to \"ram too many themes into the story.\"\n\n## Release\n\nTouchstone Pictures opted to move the release date forward by a week, from the original October 27, to <ReleaseYear>October 20, 2006</ReleaseYear>. The film earned $14.8 million on opening weekend in the United States, debuting at #1. It grossed <AdditionalInformation>$109 million worldwide</AdditionalInformation>, including $53 million from the United States. The film received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Nathan Crowley and Julie Ochipinti) and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Wally Pfister), as well as a nomination for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. The film was also nominated for both Best Science Fiction Film and Best Costume Design at the Saturn Awards.\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Full of twists and turns, The Prestige is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today described the film as \"one of the most innovative, twisting, turning art films of the past decade.\" Drew McWeeny gave the film a glowing review, saying it demands repeat viewing, with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone agreeing. On At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper, Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Jackman and Bale whilst praising Nolan for making \"this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades.\" CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it among his best films of 2006. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.\n\nOn the other hand, Dennis Harvey of Variety criticized the film as gimmicky, though he felt the cast did well in underwritten roles. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter felt that characters \"...are little more than sketches. Remove their obsessions, and the two magicians have little personality.\" Nonetheless, the two reviewers praised David Bowie as Tesla, as well as the production values and cinematography. On a simpler note, Emanuel Levy has said: \"Whether viewers perceive The Prestige as intricately complex or just unnecessarily complicated would depend to a large degree on their willingness to suspend disbelief for two hours.\" He gave the film a B grade.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, describing the revelation at the end as a \"fundamental flaw\" and a \"cheat.\" He wrote, \"The pledge of Nolan's The Prestige is that the film, having been metaphorically sawed in two, will be restored; it fails when it cheats, as, for example, if the whole woman produced on the stage were not the same one so unfortunately cut in two.\" R.J. Carter of The Trades felt, \"I love a good science fiction story; just tell me in advance.\" He gave the film a B−. Christopher Priest, who wrote the novel the film is based on, saw it three times as of January 5, 2007, and his reaction was \"'Well, holy shit.' I was thinking, 'God, I like that,' and 'Oh, I wish I'd thought of that.'\"\n\nThe film has grown in stature since its release. In 2009, The A.V. Club named The Prestige as one of the best films of the 2000s. The film was included in American Cinematographer's \"Best-Shot Film of 1998-2008\" list, ranking at 36. More than 17,000 people around the world participated in the final vote. In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it among \"The 100 Greatest Movies Of The 21st Century\".\n\n### Music\n\nThe film score was written by English musician and composer <AdditionalInformation>David Julyan</AdditionalInformation>. Julyan had previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on Following, Memento and Insomnia. Following the film's narrative, the soundtrack had three sections: the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige.\n\nAll music is composed by David Julyan\n\n|   No. | Title                                 | Length   |\n|-------|---------------------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Are You Watching Closely?\"           | 1:51     |\n|     2 | \"Colorado Springs\"                    | 4:15     |\n|     3 | \"The Light Field\"                     | 1:50     |\n|     4 | \"Borden Meets Sarah\"                  | 2:11     |\n|     5 | \"Adagio for Julia\"                    | 2:03     |\n|     6 | \"A New Trick\"                         | 4:29     |\n|     7 | \"The Journal\"                         | 2:55     |\n|     8 | \"The Transported Man\"                 | 2:36     |\n|     9 | \"No, Not Today\"                       | 2:31     |\n|    10 | \"Caught\"                              | 1:39     |\n|    11 | \"Cutter Returns\"                      | 2:13     |\n|    12 | \"The Real Transported Man\"            | 2:28     |\n|    13 | \"Man's Reach Exceeds His Imagination\" | 2:08     |\n|    14 | \"Goodbye to Jess\"                     | 2:53     |\n|    15 | \"Sacrifice\"                           | 5:15     |\n|    16 | \"The Price of a Good Trick\"           | 5:05     |\n|    17 | \"The Prestige\"                        | 1:40     |\n|    18 | \"The Tesla\"                           | 1:30     |\n\nSome critics were disappointed with the score, acknowledging that while it worked within the context of the film, it was not enjoyable by itself. Jonathan Jarry of SoundtrackNet described the score as \"merely functional,\" establishing the atmosphere of dread but never taking over. Although the reviewer was interested in the score's notion, Jarry found the execution was \"extremely disappointing.\" \n\nChristopher Coleman of Tracksounds felt that though it was \"...a perfectly fitting score,\" it was completely overwhelmed by the film, and totally unnoticed at times. Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks recommended the soundtrack for those who enjoyed Julyan's work on the film, and noted that it was not for those who expected \"any semblance of intellect or enchantment in the score to match the story of the film.\" Clemmensen called the score lifeless, \"constructed on a bed of simplistic string chords and dull electronic soundscapes.\"\n\nThe song \"Analyse\" by Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke is played over the credits.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Region 1 disc is by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, and was released on February 20, 2007, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray formats. The Warner Bros. Region 2 DVD was released on March 12, 2007. It is also available in both BD and regionless HD DVD in Europe (before HD DVD was canceled). Special features are minimal, with the documentary Director's Notebook: The Prestige – Five Making-of Featurettes, running roughly twenty minutes combined, an art gallery and the trailer. Nolan did not contribute to a commentary as he felt the film primarily relied on an audience's reaction and did not want to remove the mystery from the story.\n\nThe film was released by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 18, 2017, in the United Kingdom. The film was also released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 19, 2017, in the United States.\n\n## See also\n\n- Ship of Theseus – Thought experiment about identity over time\n- Teletransportation paradox – Thought experiment on the philosophy of identity\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to maintain readability while incorporating the relevant XML tags for the attributes specified in the ADT.

                        "Cutter: Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called 'The Pledge'. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called 'The Turn'. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige'."

She tends to believe in the supernatural, he does not, but both are spurred on by the danger of both discovery and the bombs raining down on London. Perversely, when her husband confides to Maurice his suspicion that Sarah is having an affair, Maurice hires a private detective to investigate, in effect, himself. In the end, it is God who decrees the finale, not the characters, who accommodate as best they can to their destinies.\n\nDo we really care? This is not easy to answer. Maurice, the narrator, is a prize prick, unfeeling of others, concentrated on his misery and his work, yet obsessively jealous. Sarah provides a focus for his substantial sex drive but he does develop an affection for her. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly likes a good bonk as well, but she needs the relationship to full the void left by her husband's emotional absence, and Maurice is too self-centred to be a real soulmate. She is also quite a nice person in comparison with nasty bitter old Maurice. So yes, we are sorry for her. We have to admire Maurice for being honest enough to tell the story but there is an air of self-flagellation about it. \n\nAs a film, this is a terrific piece of work, directed by the Irish director Neil Jordan who was responsible for \"The Crying Game\". Greene is a very cinematic novelist - at last count there were at least 40 screen versions of his works - and Jordan has very cleverly used a present - flashback - present and then forward technique to tell the story from both Maurice's and Sarah's viewpoint. The gloom and danger of wartime London is effectively invoked but there was a bit of overkill in having it rain almost continuously from 1939 to 1945 (London has less rain days than Sydney!) It struck me early on that Ralph Fiennes was by no means inevitable in the part - I was reminded of the early Sam Neill. His character is really rather empty - a man whose only real commitments are to his work and sex. Julianne Moore, delightfully bad as Mrs Cheveley in \"An Ideal Husband\", and delightfully slapstick as the childish Cora in \"Cookie's\" Fortune\", is much more sympathetic here. Stephen Rea (a Jordan favourite) as the cuckold is the most sympathetic of the lot or at least the most self-aware. He gives us a wonderful portrayal of stitched up dismay and yet it does not seem beyond the bounds of credibility that, knowing of the affair, he should invite Maurice to come and live with them towards the end.\n\nGreeneland is a pretty bleak place, but a couple of apparent miracles brighten things up. Greene clearly thought God had a sense of humour. The novel is said to be semi-autobiographical, but the real affair Greene had with the wife of a wealthy businessman, while no doubt equally painful, did not end so melodramatically as the novel. Looking at a biography of Greene by Michael Shelden I note that Catherine Walston, whose relationship with Greene was the chief inspiration for \"The End of the Affair,\" died in 1978, aged 62, 13 years before Greene. According to Shelden, Catherine refused to see Greene on her deathbed because she didn't want him to see how sick she was. The affair itself petered out in the early fifties, though they remained in touch. Henry Walston, it seemed, asserted himself and demanded that Catherine cut down on her contact with Greene. Greene went overseas to find danger and forget, to Vietnam and elsewhere, and these trips produced at least one more major novel, \"The Quiet American.\" However Greene's career as a writer peaked with \"The End of the Affair.\" His later work is interesting and readable, but never again did he reach the same emotional depths and heights.\n\nGreene is often said to be a Catholic novelist but on the basis of this work at least he wasn't a great pitchman for the Almighty. Greene was, however, an eloquent portrayer of spiritual suffering and this aspect has been effectively brought to the screen by Neil Jordan. Perhaps it takes an Irishman to understand an English Catholic.\n\n- Philby-3\n- Mar 17, 2000\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is The End of the Affair?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - March 9, 2000 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - El ocaso de un amor\n- Filming locations\n    - Kensal Green Cemetery, Harrow Road, Kensal Green, London, Greater London, England, UK(funeral)\n- Production company\n    - Columbia Pictures\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $23,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $10,827,816\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $198,535\n    - Dec 5, 1999\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $10,827,816\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 42 minutes\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - SDDS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of The End of the Affair (1999) in India?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\n\nTarantino wrote Pulp Fiction in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax Films fully financed.\n\nPulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress respectively. As a result of the film's success, Travolta's career was reinvigorated. The film's development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\n\nPulp Fiction is widely regarded as Tarantino's magnum opus, with particular praise for its screenwriting.[4] The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning high acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983[5] and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, Pulp Fiction was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[6][7][8]\n\n## Plot\n\n### Narrative structure\n\nPulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's partner in crime.[9]\n\nThe film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by intertitles:\n\n- \"Prologue – The Diner\" (i)\n- \"Prelude to 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'\"\n- \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n- \"Prelude to 'The Gold Watch'\" (a – flashback, b – present)\n- \"The Gold Watch\"\n- \"The Bonnie Situation\"\n- \"Epilogue – The Diner\" (ii)\n\nIf the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\".[10] Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\".[11][12]\n\n### Summary\n\nA pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, reminisce on their past robbery attempts as they eat breakfast in a diner. Pumpkin proposes they rob the diner at that moment because he believes the patrons and employees will be unprepared to stop them. Honey Bunny agrees.\n\nTwo hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, influential local gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett, and his friends. On the way, Vincent mentions that he had been tasked by Marsellus to take his wife, Mia Wallace to dinner and asks Jules questions about Mia. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's friends. Jules rebukes Brett over his attempt to double-cross Marsellus and recites what is portrayed as a passage from the Book of Ezekiel, before he and Vincent kill Brett.\n\n#### \"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\"\n\nJules and Vincent give the briefcase to Marsellus, who bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town for the night. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it, resulting in an overdose. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where Lance helps revive her by getting adrenaline for Vincent to inject into her heart. Vincent takes Mia home, and they agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.\n\n#### \"The Gold Watch\"\n\nButch double-crosses Marsellus by winning the bout, but accidentally kills his opponent in the process. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack an heirloom: a gold watch which belonged to Butch's father. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch realizes he is there to kill him, shoots him dead and departs.\n\nWhen Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic light, Butch rams his car into him. Marsellus chases him into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him. Butch breaks free and is about to escape, but decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus tells Butch that they are even, and instructs him to tell no one about the incident and depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper and they drive away.\n\n#### \"The Bonnie Situation\"\n\nIn the apartment, after Jules and Vincent kill Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. Every shot misses and they shoot him dead. Jules says that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes, believing the man was just a lousy shot. While driving away with another one of Brett's friends, Marvin (who was actually a plant from Marsellus's organization), Vincent accidentally shoots him in the head after Jules drives over an unidentified inconsistency in the roadbed, covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules's old friend and former business partner Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard.\n\nAt the diner from the film's prologue, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment was divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Pumpkin initially holds Jules at gunpoint, but Jules soon overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.\n\n## Cast\n\n- John Travolta as Vincent Vega:\n\n- Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield:\n\n- Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace:\n\n- Harvey Keitel as Winston Wolfe:\n\n- Tim Roth as Ringo/\"Pumpkin\":\n\n- Amanda Plummer as Yolanda/\"Honey Bunny\":\n\n- Maria de Medeiros as Fabienne:\n\n- Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace:\n\n- Eric Stoltz as Lance:\n\n- Rosanna Arquette as Jody:\n\n- Christopher Walken as Captain Koons:\n\n- Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge:\n\nBronagh Gallagher plays Jody's friend Trudi who does little but smoke a bong during the scene where Vincent revives Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, \"Quentin thought it would be funny to have this casual observer who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there\".[50] Phil LaMarr portrays Marvin, an associate of Jules and Vincent. LaMarr auditioned for Tarantino after both had done a show for an improv group a few months prior.[51] He read for the roles of Jules Winnfield and Brett before being cast as Marvin.[51] Tarantino appears as Jules' friend Jimmie, in whose house they clean up a murder. Tarantino was unsure whether to play Jimmie or Lance, choosing Jimmie as he wanted to be behind the camera during Mia's overdose scene.[38]\n\nFrank Whaley portrays Brett, who has a briefcase requested by Marsellus. Whaley met Tarantino while he was filming Reservoir Dogs at a lab in Sundance Institute. He recalls, \"we ended up meeting and spending time together, and I liked him, so I was really happy when he asked me to be in this movie.\"[52] Burr Steers appears as Roger, a friend of Brett's nicknamed \"Flock of Seagulls\" by Jules. The scene of the confrontation between Brett and Jules went through several takes due to Steers making mistakes. Steers recalled in an interview that he had found acting difficult due to the loudness of the gunshots.[53]\n\nAngela Jones portrays Esmarelda Villalobos, a cab driver who aids Butch's escape. Her casting and character were inspired by her performance in the 1991 short film Curdled, later remade as a 1996 feature film with finance from Tarantino and again starring Jones.[54] Duane Whitaker, Peter Greene and Stephen Hibbert play Maynard, Zed and the gimp.[55] According to The Daily Beast, these \"three psycho hillbillies\" that rape Marsellus in Maynard's shop's basement allude to the film Deliverance.[54][55] Steve Buscemi makes a cameo appearance as a waiter at Jack Rabbit Slim's, dressed as Buddy Holly. Buscemi, who had appeared in Reservoir Dogs, was originally considered for the role of Jimmie but was unable to commit.[54] Kathy Griffin appears as herself.[42] Michael Gilden and Joseph Pilato also appear at Jack Rabbit Slim's as waiter Phillip Morris Page and a Dean Martin impersonator, respectively. Emil Sitka made a cameo via archival footage from the Three Stooges short Brideless Groom (1947), Karen Maruyama appears as \"Gawker #1\" after Butch's car accident, and Julia Sweeney portrays Raquel, the daughter of the owner of the junkyard in which Marvin's body is disposed of. Producer Lawrence Bender makes a cameo as a victim of the diner robbery, credited as \"Long Hair Yuppie-Scum\". Jerome Patrick Hoban appears in the Jack Rabbit Slim's segment as an Ed Sullivan impersonator. Susan Griffiths appears alongside Hoban as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.\n\n## Production\n\n### Writing\n\nDirector and co-writer, Quentin Tarantino\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe roots of Pulp Fiction can be traced back to the late 1980s, when Tarantino and Roger Avary worked together at Video Archives, a video store in Southern California. Avary recalls that their initial concept was to create three short films with three different filmmakers—himself, Tarantino, and a friend, Adam Rifkin.[56] Avary wrote the first element of what would become the film's screenplay in the fall of 1990,[57] titled \"Pandemonium Reigns,\" which eventually expanded into a feature-length screenplay. While Tarantino's short film similarly evolved into a full script, Rifkin never completed his contribution, leaving Pulp Fiction initially uncertain.[56] The initial inspiration was the three-part horror anthology film Black Sabbath (1963), by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava. The Tarantino–Avary project was provisionally titled \"Black Mask\", after the seminal hardboiled crime fiction magazine.[32] Tarantino's script was produced as Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut; Avary created the basis for the \"Gold Watch\" storyline of Pulp Fiction.[58][59][60][61]\n\nWith work on Reservoir Dogs completed, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: \"I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story.\"[62] Tarantino explains that the idea \"was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories – the oldest stories in the book ... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife' – the oldest story about ... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times.\"[9] \"I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry\", he says. \"Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel.\"[63] In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: \"I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly [1955]. I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk\".[48]\n\nTarantino went to work on the script for Pulp Fiction in Amsterdam in March 1992,[64] possibly at the Winston Hotel in the Red Light District.[65] He was joined there by Avary, who contributed \"Pandemonium Reigns\" to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it.[58][59][60] Two scenes originally written by Avary for the True Romance screenplay, exclusively credited to Tarantino, were incorporated into the opening of \"The Bonnie Situation\": the \"miraculous\" missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing.[66] The notion of the crimeworld \"cleaner\" that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short, Curdled, that Tarantino saw at a film festival. He cast the lead actress, Angela Jones, in Pulp Fiction and later backed the filmmakers' production of a feature-length version of Curdled.[67] The script included a couple of made-up commercial brands that often featured in later Tarantino films: Big Kahuna burgers (a Big Kahuna soda cup appears in Reservoir Dogs) and Red Apple cigarettes.[68] As he worked on the script, Tarantino also accompanied Reservoir Dogs around the European film festivals. Released in the United States in October 1992, the picture was a critical and commercial success. In January 1993, the Pulp Fiction script was complete.[69][70]\n\nThe adrenaline scene was inspired by the Martin Scorsese documentary American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince about Taxi Driver actor Steven Prince, who played arms dealer Easy Andy in the film. Prince recalls injecting adrenaline into the heart of a woman who overdosed, with the help of a medical dictionary and a Magic Marker.[71][72]\n\n### Financing\n\nTarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films. Before even seeing Reservoir Dogs, Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project.[73] Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio.[74][75][76][77] Jersey had a distribution and \"first look\" deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option.[47] In February, Pulp Fiction appeared on a Variety list of films in pre-production at TriStar.[78] In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround.[47] According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it \"too demented\".[79] There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image.[80][81] Avary—who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, Killing Zoe—has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position: \"'This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ... So I thought, 'That's that!'\"[66]\n\nBender brought the script to Miramax Films, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinstein—co-chairman of Miramax Films, along with his brother Bob—was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up.[82] Michael Shamberg, the executive producer, reflected on the bidding process, saying, \"Only Harvey [Weinstein] placed a bid. Harvey believed he was engaged in a bidding war, but he wasn't. Even now, whenever I see Bob Shaye, he expresses regret for turning down Pulp Fiction. Quentin initially wanted to collaborate with Mike Medavoy, given Medavoy's history with the great Orion films. Ironically, when the opportunity arose, Mike deemed the script too violent.\"[56] Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax Films project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million, and at the end $500,000 was returned, bringing the final budget to $8 million.[a][56] According to Bender, a lower budget meant that the producers could maintain more control over the movie itself.[56]\nIt became the first movie that Miramax Films completely financed.[83] Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status.[84][47] The New York Times reported, \"Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.\"[85] The biggest star to sign on to the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax Films garnered $11 million for the film's worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.[86][87]\n\n### Casting\n\nDanny DeVito, one of the film's producers,[88] recalls that Weinstein suggested casting Daniel Day-Lewis, who had just won an Academy Award for My Left Foot. DeVito responded by stating that Tarantino wanted John Travolta and reminded Weinstein that he had final cut and cast approval. He later reflected: \"I think he [Weinstein] called me every name in the book, but of course, Quentin got what he wanted, and he was absolutely right, and the rest is history.\"[56]\n\nBender noted that during the casting process, while Samuel L. Jackson's initial audition was impressive, another candidate later delivered a performance that \"blew them away.\" This prompted Bender to inform Jackson's agent that they might need to consider the other actor. The agent firmly insisted, \"No, no, no, you can't do that. Sam will come back.\" Initially hesitant to ask him for another audition, Bender discovered that Jackson believed he was simply reading for the role, not auditioning, and his subsequent return resulted in an outstanding performance.[56]\n\nTim Roth, initially interested in the role meant for Willis, suggested Amanda Plummer as a co-star, insisting she should have a gun as he thought it would be \"terrifying\" - a notion Tarantino later incorporated into the script.[56]\n\nHarvey Keitel played a crucial role in getting Reservoir Dogs made and introduced Bruce Willis to Tarantino. Bender and Tarantino went to see him at his house in Malibu, where they learned that he could recite practically the entire movie of Reservoir Dogs, a movie he loved. After a conversation, Tarantino and Willis took a walk on the beach, where Willis revealed he'd read the Pulp Fiction script and expressed interest in playing Vincent or Jules. Tarantino encouraged him to read the script one last time with the Butch character in mind. Willis called Tarantino the next day and said, \"the shortest sentence in the Bible is, 'Jesus wept.' The shortest sentence in Hollywood is, 'I'm in.'\"[56]\n\n### Filming\n\nWillis evoked one 1950s actor in particular for Tarantino: \"Aldo Ray in Jacques Tourneur's Nightfall [1956] ... I said let's go for that whole look.\"[91] His boxing robe, designed by Betsy Heimann, exemplifies Tarantino's notion of costume as symbolic armor.[92]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography commenced on September 20, 1993.[93] The lead offscreen talent had all worked with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs – cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino: \"[W]e had $8 million. I wanted it to look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it to look like an epic. It's an epic in everything – in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag.\"[94] The film, he says, was shot \"on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest thing we have to 50s Technicolor.\"[95] The largest chunk of the budget – $150,000 – went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set.[84][96] It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices.[97] The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture.[98] For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor.[92] Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in Reservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film.[99] The shoot wrapped on November 30.[100] Before Pulp Fiction's premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a \"story by\" credit, so the line \"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino\" could be used in advertising and onscreen.[24]\n\n## Music\n\nNo film score was composed for Pulp Fiction; Quentin Tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment of surf music, rock and roll, soul, and pop songs. Dick Dale's rendition of \"Misirlou\" plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: \"To me it just sounds like rock and roll, even Morricone music. It sounds like rock and roll spaghetti Western music.\"[101] Tarantino planned to use a power pop song, \"My Sharona\" by The Knack, during the film's rape scene, but ultimately discounted it.[55]\n\nSome of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants. Lovelace also appeared in the film as Laura, a waitress; she reprises the role in Jackie Brown.[102] The soundtrack album was released along with the film in 1994. The album peaked on the Billboard 200 chart at number 21.[103] The single, Urge Overkill's cover of the Neil Diamond song \"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\", reached number 59.[104]\n\nEstella Tincknell describes how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a \"self-consciously 'cool' text. [The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such as Dusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' is crucial to the film's postmodern knowingness.\" She contrasts the soundtrack with that of Forrest Gump, the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: \"[T]he version of 'the sixties' offered by Pulp Fiction ... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in Forrest Gump, but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle – surfing, 'hanging' – that is resolutely apolitical.\" The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film's engagement with the \"younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator\" it solicits.[105]\n\n## Release and reception\n\n### Release and box office\n\nPulp Fiction premiered in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins \"hit the beach like commandos,\" bringing the picture's entire cast over to France.[106] The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation.[107][108] It won the Palme d'Or, the festival's top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.[109]\n\nThe first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazine Variety. Todd McCarthy called Pulp Fiction a \"spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture ... a startling, massive success.\"[110] From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film.[87] Over the next few months, it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebastián.[111] Tarantino later said: \"One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience's] alpha state. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this ... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.\"[112] In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. The New York Times published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a \"triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color ... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.\"[108]\n\n| External videos                                                                 | External videos                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Charlie Rose interview with Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, October 14, 1994 | Charlie Rose interview with Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, October 14, 1994 |\n\nOn October 14, 1994, Pulp Fiction went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind described: \"It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.\"[113] In the eyes of some cultural critics, Reservoir Dogs had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: \"You won't know the facts till you've seen the fiction\", went one slogan.[114] Pulp Fiction was the top-grossing film at the US box office its first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, The Specialist, which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax was disputed by others. Warner Bros. initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9 million for The Specialist, with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross for Pulp Fiction of $9.1 million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warners then updated their gross to $9.3 million, claiming they had made a calculation error.[115]\nEarly Monday morning, Miramax reported a gross of $9.3 million with Warners reporting $8.9 million for The Specialist, placing Pulp Fiction first but other industry sources did not believe Miramax's numbers. Variety estimated that Pulp Fiction grossed $8.6 to $9 million for the weekend.[116]\n\nAgainst its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction grossed $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first Miramax film to surpass $100 million in the United States and Canada.[117] Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million.[c] In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20.[119] Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, \"indicates the kind of cult status that Pulp Fiction achieved almost immediately.\"[120] As MovieMaker puts it, \"The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.\"[121] Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.[122]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 183 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Injecting its compendium of crime tales with the patois of everyday conversation, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic shot of adrenaline that cements writer-director Quentin Tarantino as an audacious purveyor of killer kino.\"[123] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[124] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[125]\n\nThe response of major American film reviewers was widely favorable. Roger Ebert called it \"a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... The screenplay by Tarantino and Roger Avary so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it – the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films'\".[126] Richard Corliss of Time wrote: \"It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.\"[127] In Newsweek, David Ansen wrote: \"The miracle of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.\"[128] \"You get intoxicated by it,\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman, \"high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does.\"[21] \"There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive\", wrote Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. \"Pulp Fiction is indisputably great.\"[129]\n\nThe Los Angeles Times was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film's opening weekend. Kenneth Turan wrote: \"The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.\"[130] Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to Pulp Fiction itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that \"the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.\"[131] Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote: \"The fact that Pulp Fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful – namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand.\"[132] Observing in the National Review that \"[n]o film arrives with more advance hype\", John Simon was unswayed: \"titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness\".[133]\n\nDebate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. In The Washington Post, Donna Britt described how she was happy not to see Pulp Fiction on a recent weekend and thus avoid \"discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody's brains around a car interior\".[134] Some commentators took exception to the film's frequent use of the word \"nigger\" (mentioned 18 times). In the Chicago Tribune, Todd Boyd argued that the word's recurrence \"has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool\".[135] In Britain, James Wood, writing in The Guardian, set the tone for much subsequent criticism: \"Tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies ... Only in this age could a writer as talented as Tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.\"[136]\n\n### Awards season\n\nAround the turn of the year, Pulp Fiction was named Best Picture by the National Society of Film Critics, National Board of Review, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Boston Society of Film Critics, Society of Texas Film Critics, Southeastern Film Critics Association, and Kansas City Film Critics Circle.[d] Tarantino was named Best Director by all seven of those organizations as well as by the New York Film Critics Circle[143] and Chicago Film Critics Association.[144] The screenplay won several prizes, with various awarding bodies ascribing credit differently. At the 52nd Golden Globe Awards, Tarantino, named as sole recipient of the Best Screenplay honor, failed to mention Avary in his acceptance speech.[145] In February 1995, the film received seven Oscar nominations – Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman), Original Screenplay, and Film Editing. Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were each nominated as well for the 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards, presented on February 25, but none took home the honor.[146] At the Academy Awards ceremony the following month, Tarantino and Avary were announced as joint winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[147] The furor around the film was still going strong: much of the March issue of Artforum was devoted to its critical dissection.[148] Pulp Fiction garnered four honors at the Independent Spirit Awards, held at the end of the month – Best Feature, Best Director, Male Lead (Jackson), and Best Screenplay (Tarantino).[149] At the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA), Tarantino and Avary shared the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Jackson won for Best Supporting Actor.[150] The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.[151]\n\nThe February 2020 issue of New York Magazine listed Pulp Fiction alongside Citizen Kane, Sunset Boulevard, Dr. Strangelove, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Conversation, Nashville, Taxi Driver, The Elephant Man, In the Bedroom, There Will Be Blood, and Roma as \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars\".[152]\n\n## Legacy and influence\n\nPulp Fiction quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition of Siskel &amp; Ebert devoted to Tarantino, Gene Siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\n\nthe violent intensity of Pulp Fiction calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. Hitchcock's Psycho [1960], Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde [1967], and Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for Pulp Fiction. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.[153]\n\nKen Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\" – like that of its predecessor, Reservoir Dogs – represents\n\na new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold – the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the gangster films or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.[154]\n\nJohn Travolta, Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, for the film's 20th anniversary tribute.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Bob Dole, Senate Majority Leader and Republican presidential candidate for the then-upcoming 1996 presidential election (as well as the party's vice presidential nominee in the 1976 presidential election), attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling \"nightmares of depravity\". Pulp Fiction was soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence. Dole had not mentioned the film, instead citing two less-celebrated movies based on Tarantino screenplays, Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and Tony Scott's True Romance.[155] In September 1996, Dole did accuse Pulp Fiction – which he had not seen at the time – of promoting \"the romance of heroin\".[156]\n\nPaula Rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion that Pulp Fiction \"simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir\".[157] In Peter Biskind's description, it created a \"guys-with-guns frenzy\".[158] The film has also been labeled as a black comedy[3] and a \"neo-noir\".[159][160][161] Critic Geoffrey O'Brien, however, argued against the classification of Pulp Fiction into the neo-noir genre: \"The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.\"[162] Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it \"more gangland camp than neo-noir\",[163][164] and Foster Hirsch suggests that its \"trippy fantasy landscape\" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label.[165] Regardless, the stylistic influence of Pulp Fiction soon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture's release, British critic Jon Ronson attended the National Film School's end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: \"Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of The Brady Bunch before offing their victim. Not since Citizen Kane has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking.\"[166] Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators were Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995), in which Tarantino acted,[153] Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995),[167] and 2 Days in the Valley (1996).[168] It \"triggered a myriad of clones\", writes Fiona Villella.[169] Internationally, according to David Desser, it \"not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world\".[170] Pulp Fiction's effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, when David Denby of The New Yorker credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.[171]\n\nAccording to Variety, the trajectory of Pulp Fiction from Cannes launch to commercial smash \"forever altered the game\" of so-called independent cinema.[172] It \"cemented Miramax's place as the reigning indie superpower\", writes Biskind.[113] \"Pulp became the Star Wars of independents, exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office.\"[173] The film's large financial return on its small budget\n\ntransform[ed] the industry's attitude toward the lowly indies ... spawning a flock of me-too classics divisions ... [S]mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share, which got all the press, were not the same as profits ... Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own ... copy[ing] Miramax's marketing and distribution strategies.[174]\n\nIn 2001, Variety, noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low-budget independent or indie-style projects, suggested that the \"watershed moment for movie stars\" came with the decision by Willis – one of Hollywood's highest-paid performers – to appear in Pulp Fiction.[175] In 2024, on the film's 30th anniversary, the magazine wrote that the film \"revived the career of John Travolta, minted a star in Samuel L. Jackson and spawned a still-thriving cottage industry of knockoffs and imitation films.\"[56]\n\nIt has been described as a \"major cultural event\", an \"international phenomenon\" that influenced television, music, literature, and advertising.[169][176] Not long after its release, it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of Internet users.[177] Adding Pulp Fiction to his roster of The Great Movies in 2001, Roger Ebert called it \"the most influential film of the decade\".[178] Four years later, Time's Corliss wrote much the same: \"(unquestionably) the most influential American movie of the 90s\".[179]\n\nSeveral scenes and images from the film achieved iconic status; in 2008, Entertainment Weekly declared, \"You'd be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino's film that isn't iconic.\"[5] Jules and Vincent's \"Royale with Cheese\" dialogue became famous.[180] It was referenced more than a decade and a half later in the Travolta vehicle From Paris with Love.[181] The adrenalin shot to Mia Wallace's heart is on Premiere's list of \"100 Greatest Movie Moments\".[182] The scene of Travolta and Thurman's characters dancing has been frequently homaged, most unambiguously in the 2005 film Be Cool, starring the same two actors.[183] The image of Travolta and Jackson's characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007, BBC News reported that \"London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by 'guerrilla artist' Banksy ... The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns.\"[184] Certain lines were adopted popularly as catchphrases, in particular Marsellus's threat, \"I'm 'a get medieval on your ass.\"[185] Jules's \"Ezekiel\" recitation was voted the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll. One of the more notable homages to Jules's \"Biblical\" quote was one Jackson himself played a part in, near the end of 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Jackson's character Col. Nick Fury, presumed dead, visits his own gravestone, on which, below Fury's name is inscribed \"The path of the righteous man ...\" Ezekiel 25:17.[186] In 2019, it was reported that Dominic Cummings, special political adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, quoted Jules by telling Conservative MPs to \"be cool like Fonzies\" as political pressure built to request an extension to the date of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.[187]\n\nPulp Fiction now appears in several critical assessments of all-time great films. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film of the past quarter-century.[5] That same year, the American Film Institute's \"Ten Top Ten\" poll ranked it number 7 all-time in the gangster film genre.[188] In 2007, it was voted 94th overall on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list.[189] In 2005, it was named one of \"Time's All-Time 100 Movies\".[179] As of September 2018, it is number 54 on Metacritic's list of all-time highest scores.[190] The film ranks very highly in popular surveys. A 2008 Empire poll combining the opinions of readers, movie industry professionals, and critics named Pulp Fiction the ninth-best film of all time.[191] In a 2006 readers' poll by the British magazine Total Film, it ranked as the number three film in history.[192] It was voted as the fourth-greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Britain's Channel 4 in 2001.[193] In 2015, Pulp Fiction ranked 28th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.[194]\n\n## Critical analysis\n\nTarantino has stated that he originally planned \"to do a Black Mask movie\", referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizing hardboiled detective fiction. \"[I]t kind of went somewhere else\".[162] Geoffrey O'Brien sees the result as connected \"rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as Cornell Woolrich [and] Fredric Brown ... Both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm that Pulp Fiction makes its own.\"[195] In particular, O'Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown's novels and the recursive, interweaving structure of Pulp Fiction.[196] Philip French describes the film's narrative as a \"circular movement or Möbius strip of a kind Resnais and Robbe-Grillet would admire\".[197] James Mottram regards crime novelist Elmore Leonard, whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film's primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard's \"rich dialogue\" is reflected in Tarantino's \"popular-culture-strewn jive\"; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.[198]\n\nFilm scholar/historian Robert Kolker sees the \"flourishes, the apparent witty banality of the dialogue, the goofy fracturing of temporality [as] a patina over a pastiche. The pastiche ... is essentially of two films that Tarantino can't seem to get out of his mind: Mean Streets [1973; directed by Martin Scorsese, who loved Pulp Fiction and the way the film was told[199]] and The Killing [1956; directed by Stanley Kubrick].\"[200] He contrasts Pulp Fiction with postmodern Hollywood predecessors Hudson Hawk (1991; starring Willis) and Last Action Hero (1993; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) that \"took the joke too far ... simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience\" and flopped.[201] Todd McCarthy writes that the film's \"striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close-up as well as vivid contrasts, sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies of Sergio Leone\", an acknowledged hero of Tarantino's.[110] To Martin Rubin, the \"expansive, brightly colored widescreen visuals\" evoke comedy directors such as Frank Tashlin and Blake Edwards.[202]\n\nThe movie's host of pop culture allusions, ranging from the famous image of Marilyn Monroe's skirt flying up over a subway grating to Jules addressing a soon-to-be victim as \"Flock of Seagulls\" because of his haircut,[203][204] have led many critics to discuss it within the framework of postmodernism. Describing the film in 2005 as Tarantino's \"postmodern masterpiece ... to date\", David Walker writes that it \"is marked by its playful reverence for the 1950s ... and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films\". He characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as \"postmodern tricksiness\".[205] Calling the film a \"terminally hip postmodern collage\", Foster Hirsch finds Pulp Fiction far from a masterpiece: \"authoritative, influential, and meaningless\". Set \"in a world that could exist only in the movies\", it is \"a succulent guilty pleasure, beautifully made junk food for cinéastes\".[206] O'Brien, dismissing attempts to associate the movie with film noir, argues that \"Pulp Fiction is more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus, Buddy Holly and Mamie Van Doren, fragments of blaxploitation and Roger Corman and Shogun Assassin, music out of a twenty-four-hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously.\"[162] Catherine Constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenalin is plunged into the comatose Mia's heart as exemplary. She proposes that it \"can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead, simultaneously recalling and undermining the Gothic convention of the vampire's stake. On this model, the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond ... empty pastiche, sustaining an 'inventive and affirmative' mode of postmodernism.\"[207]\n\nMark T. Conard asks, \"[W]hat is the film about?\" and answers, \"American nihilism.\"[208] Hirsch suggests, \"If the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness, it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family.\"[168] Richard Alleva argues that \"Pulp Fiction has about as much to do with actual criminality or violence as Cyrano de Bergerac with the realities of seventeenth-century France or The Prisoner of Zenda with Balkan politics.\" He reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters' nonnaturalistic discourse, \"wise-guy literate, media-smart, obscenely epigrammatic\".[209] In Alan Stone's view, the \"absurd dialogue\", like that between Vincent and Jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills Marvin, \"unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence cliché ... Pulp Fiction unmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard Hollywood violence.\"[210] Stone reads the film as \"politically correct. There is no nudity and no violence directed against women ... [It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype.\"[210]\n\nWhere Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: \"The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism of Pulp Fiction were perfectly acceptable because the film didn't pretend seriousness and therefore didn't mock it.\"[201] Calling it the \"acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking\", he explains, \"the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures.\"[211] According to Kolker:\n\nThat's why Pulp Fiction was so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off – by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.[212]\n\nHenry A. Giroux argues that Tarantino \"empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing ... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.\"[213]\n\nRegarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that Pulp Fiction should be seen in light of the short stories of Flannery O'Connor,[214] which likewise feature \"religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.\" Discussing \"the connection between violence and redemption,\" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers \"of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,\" Tarantino \"seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film – all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior – grace is still possible; there might still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.\"[215]\n\n### Homage as essence\n\n#### Cinema\n\nPulp Fiction is full of homages to other movies. \"Tarantino's characters\", writes Gary Groth, \"inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac – he literally can't help himself.\"[216] Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highly intertextual style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal Saturday Night Fever (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the Jean-Luc Godard film Bande à part (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;\n\nEverybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, \"Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.\"... My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it's not a musical, but he's stopping the movie to have a musical sequence, makes it all the more sweet.[217]\n\nJerome Charyn argues that, beyond \"all the better\", Travolta's presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:\n\nTravolta's entire career becomes \"backstory\", the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology ... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder ... [Vince and Mia's] actual dance may be closer to the choreography of Anna Karina's shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in Bande à part, but even that reference is lost to us, and we're with Tony again ...[218]\n\nEstella Tincknell notes that while the \"diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a 'fifties' restaurant ... the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes 'the sixties,' while Travolta's dance performance inevitably references 'the seventies' and his appearance in Saturday Night Fever. ... The 'past' thus becomes a more general 'pastness' in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment.\"[219] She also argues that in this passage the film \"briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic film musical and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion.\"[219]\n\nThe pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch's car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane's boss sees her under similar circumstances in Psycho (1960).[220][221] Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, \"two sadistic honkies straight out of Deliverance\" (1972), directed by John Boorman.[210] Zed shares a name with Sean Connery's character in Boorman's follow-up, the science-fiction film Zardoz (1974). When Butch decides to rescue Marsellus, in Glyn White's words, \"he finds a trove of items with film-hero resonances\".[222] Critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions:\n\n- Hammer – The Toolbox Murders (1978)[223]\n- Baseball bat – Walking Tall (1973);[222] The Untouchables (1987)[223]\n- Chainsaw – The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974);[222][223] Evil Dead II (1987)[222]\n- Katana (samurai sword) – many, including Seven Samurai (1954);[222][223] The Yakuza (1975);[222] and Shogun Assassin (1980)[223]\n\nAt the conclusion of the scene, a portentous line of Marsellus's echoes one from the crime drama Charley Varrick (1973), directed by another of Tarantino's heroes, Don Siegel; the name of the character who speaks it there is Maynard.[224][225][226][227]\n\nDavid Bell argues that far from going against the \"current of class stereotype\", this scene, like Deliverance, \"mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk – and particularly their sexualization ... 'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.\"[228] Stephen Paul Miller believes the Pulp Fiction scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: \"The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in Deliverance ... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play – a fiction, a pulp fiction.\"[229] Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: \"in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.\"[230] In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that \"in Deliverance the rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas in Pulp Fiction it was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'\"[231] (\"American Me did it too,\" Tarantino observed. \"There's like three butt-fucking scenes in American Me. That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!\"[232])\n\nNeil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, \"Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an enfant terrible of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.\"[223] White asserts that \"the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with ... honourable heroes.\"[222] Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined moral code and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.[233]\n\nThe biker film Nam's Angels is also shown with Fabienne characterizing it as \"A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.\"[234]\n\n#### Television\n\nRobert Miklitsch argues that \"Tarantino's telephilia\" may be more central to the guiding sensibility of Pulp Fiction than the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:\n\nTalking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the \"number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television.\" A random list of the TV programs referenced in Pulp Fiction confirms his observation: Speed Racer, Clutch Cargo, The Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, The Avengers, The Three Stooges, The Flintstones, I Spy, Green Acres, Kung Fu, Happy Days, and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot, Fox Force Five.[235]\n\n\"The above list, with the possible exception of The Avengers,\" writes Miklitsch, \"suggests that Pulp Fiction has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.\"[236] Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: \"But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of TV Guide.\"[132]\n\nSharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (Clutch Cargo) marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie The Deer Hunter (1978). Willis writes that \"when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation ... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.\"[237] Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a \"prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV.\"[236] Kolker might not disagree, arguing that \"Pulp Fiction is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.\"[212]\n\n### Notable motifs\n\n#### The mysterious 666 briefcase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is 666, the \"Number of the Beast\". Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents – it is simply a MacGuffin, a pure plot device. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened.[240] In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino purportedly \"reveals\" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse (2007), with an intertitle that reads \"Missing Reel\". The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the \"knowledge\" of the briefcase's contents alters one's understanding of the movie.[241]\n\nDespite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this \"unexplained postmodern puzzle\" have been proposed.[120] A strong similarity has often been observed with Robert Aldrich's 1955 film noir Kiss Me Deadly, which features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive.[231][242][243] In their review of Alex Cox's 1984 film Repo Man in The Daily Telegraph, Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest that Pulp Fiction may also owe \"a debt of inspiration\" to the glowing car trunk in that film.[244] In scholar Paul Gormley's view, this connection with Kiss Me Deadly, and a similar one with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself.[245] The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus's soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion, Roger Ebert dismissed it as \"nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net\".[246]\n\n#### Jules' Bible passage\n\nJules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, Ezekiel 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times – in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus's briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of \"The Bonnie Situation\", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:\n\nThe path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.\n\nThe second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: \"And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConclusion of the \"Ezekiel 25:17\" monologue and Brett's murder\n\nWhile the final two sentences of Jules's speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.[247] The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of the Philistines. In the King James Version from which Jules's speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:\n\nAnd I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.[248]\n\nTarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese martial arts star Sonny Chiba. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie Karate Kiba (The Bodyguard; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.[249][250]\n\nThe version seen at the beginning of The Bodyguard (1976) is as follows:\n\nThe path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!\n\nIn the 1980s television series Kage no Gundan (Shadow Warriors), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.[251] A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in Modesty Blaise, the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.[252]\n\nTwo critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules's transformation and the issue of postmodernity. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters – Marsellus aside – Jules is:\n\nlinked to a \"thing\" beyond postmodern simulation ... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was \"just a cool thing to say ...\" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.[253]\n\nAdele Reinhartz writes that the \"depth of Jules's transformation\" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: \"In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness ... In the second ... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether ... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.\"[254] Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him \"that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life\"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture.[255] Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: \"[T]he spiritual awakening at the end of Pulp Fiction, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.\"[132]\n\n#### The bathroom\n\nMuch of Pulp Fiction's action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element.[256] At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to \"powder her nose\" – literally; she snorts coke in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth – vigorously, after having given Butch \"oral pleasure.\" As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom – his actions will lead to Jules' transformative \"moment of clarity\". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.[171] When the diner holdup turns into a standoff, \"Honey Bunny\" whines, \"I gotta go pee!\"[257]\n\nAs described by Peter and Will Brooker, \"In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.\"[258] The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:\n\n- Vincent and Jules's diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.\n- While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus's wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.\n- During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.\n\nIn the Brookers' analysis, \"Through Vince ... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.\"[258] Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading Modesty Blaise in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as \"the archetypal consumers of pulp\":\n\nLocating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of \"pulp\" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations – pulp, women, shit – that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.[259]\n\nWillis reads Pulp Fiction in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding \"its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim.\"[237] Despite that, argues Fraiman, \"Pulp Fiction demonstrates ... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.\"[257]\n\n## Accolades\n\nPulp Fiction won eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including a Best Original Screenplay win at the 67th Academy Awards.[109][147][150][260][137] Also, in the balloting by the National Society of Film Critics, Samuel L. Jackson was the runner-up in both the Best Actor and the Best Supporting Actor categories.[137]\n\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\n\n- AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies – No. 95[261]\n- AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs – Nominated[262]\n- AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills – No. 53[263]\n- AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Heroes &amp;amp; Villains :[ 264]\n    - Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield – Nominated Villains\n- AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movie Quotes :[ 265]\n    - \"Bring out the Gimp\" – Nominated Quote\n    - \"They call it a Royale with Cheese\" – Nominated Quote\n- AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – No. 94[189]\n- AFI's 10 Top 10 – No. 7 gangster film[188]\n\n## NFT dispute\n\nIn November 2021, Miramax filed a lawsuit against Tarantino who released seven NFTs based on uncut and unseen scenes of Pulp Fiction and including the original handwritten script \"revealing secrets about the film and its creator.\" Miramax claimed they own the film rights.[266] However, Tarantino disputed the lawsuit and claimed he had rights to the film script in written form.[267] The matter was later settled with Miramax's lawyers filing a brief statement in court: \"The parties have agreed to put this matter behind them and look forward to collaborating with each other on future projects, including possible NFTs.\"[268]\n\n## See also\n\n- Film portal\n- United States portal\n- 1990s portal\n\n- The Killers (Hemingway short story)\n- The Killers (1946)\n- List of cult films\n- Plump Fiction\n- Pulp Friction\n- Quentin Tarantino filmography\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ a b In Waxman (2005, p. 67), Biskind (2004, p. 170), Polan (2000, p. 69),\n Dawson (1995a, pp. 147–148)\n- ^ Walken's speech to the young Butch has been described as a \"bravura performance of patriotic zeal and scatological fetishism worthy of a Kubrickian anti-hero\".[41]\n- ^ [113][118][2] Box Office Mojo gives $106 million in foreign grosses for a worldwide total of $213.9 million; Biskind and Waxman apparently concur that $105M / $212.9M are the correct figures.\n- ^ National Society of Film Critics,[137] National Board of Review,[138] Los Angeles Film Critics Society,[139] Boston Society of Film Critics,[140] Society of Texas Film Critics,[141] Kansas City Film Critics Circle[142]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Pulp Fiction\".

It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles. The film stars <MainCharacters>John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman</MainCharacters>. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.\n\nTarantino wrote <Pulp Fiction> in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for True Romance (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \"pulp\". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as \"too demented\". Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax Films fully financed.\n\n<Pulp Fiction> won the <Awards>Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival</Awards> and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress respectively. As a result of the film's success, Travolta's career was reinvigorated. The film's development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.\n\n<Pulp Fiction> is widely regarded as Tarantino's magnum opus, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning high acclaim. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, <Pulp Fiction> was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the key attributes of the movie while maintaining the original meaning and flow of the text.

Sam Raimi co-wrote the script and served as second unit director. The film stars Tim Robbins as a naïve but ambitious business school graduate who is installed as president of a manufacturing company, Jennifer Jason Leigh as a newspaper reporter, and Paul Newman as a company director who hires the graduate as part of a stock scam.\n\nThe script was finished in 1985, but production did not start until 1991, when Joel Silver acquired the script for Silver Pictures. Warner Bros. subsequently agreed to distribute the film, with further financing from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films. Filming at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, lasted from November 1992 to March 1993. The New York City scale model set was designed by Michael J. McAlister and Mark Stetson, with further effects provided by The Computer Film Company.\n\nUpon its release in March 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy received mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office, but has since gained a cult following.[5]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn December 1958, Norville Barnes, a business college graduate from Muncie, Indiana, arrives in New York City, looking for a job. He struggles due to lack of experience and becomes a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries, a large corporation. Soon thereafter, the company's founder and president, Waring Hudsucker, unexpectedly commits suicide during a business meeting by jumping out of a top-floor window.\n\nAfterward, Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the company's board of directors, knowing that Hudsucker Industries' bylaws call for Hudsucker's stock shares to be sold to the public, suggests a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring a clearly incompetent president to run the business.\n\nIn the mailroom, Norville is assigned to deliver a \"Blue Letter\" to Mussburger. The letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville does not deliver the letter; instead, he pitches Mussburger an invention of his (indicated with no other explanation than a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, \"you know: for kids\"). Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker.\n\nAcross town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus newspaper, is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She obtains a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from his alma mater in Muncie.\n\nOne night, Amy searches the building for clues and meets Moses, who operates the tower's giant clock and knows \"just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker\". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe it.\n\nThe other executives at Hudsucker Industries decide to produce Norville's invention in hopes that it will flop and further depress the company's stock. However, the invention is the hula-hoop, which initially fails in obscurity but then becomes an enormous success.\n\nNorville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the bendy straw, which Buzz calls the \"Buzz-sucker.\" Norville insults the idea and cruelly fires Buzz, ignoring his pleas that he needs the job.\n\nMeanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight.\n\nWhile Norville plummets, Moses stops the building's giant clock, which freezes time. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him to read the Blue Letter (still in Norville's uniform pocket) that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger: it contains Hudsucker's instructions to transfer his shares to his immediate successor as president, rather than to the public. This would have been Mussburger, but, unaware of this, he proceeded with his scheme to elect Norville.\n\nInside the building's giant clock, Moses fights Aloysius, defeating him. Norville descends safely to the ground. He and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, Mussburger attempts suicide and is sent to an asylum, while Norville develops a new invention for kids: another enigmatic circle on a folded sheet of paper that ultimately turns out to be a frisbee.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Tim Robbins as Norville Barnes\n- Jennifer Jason Leigh as Amy Archer\n- Paul Newman as Sidney J.

Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981,[6] and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985),[7] and post-production on Blood Simple (1984), during which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire Sullivan's Travels (1941).[8] The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946).[9] The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms.[8] Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957).[10] The brothers had no intention of commenting on or parodying such movies. Instead, as Ethan said, \"It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say 'They're really fun - let's do one'; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them.'\" Raimi describes the script as \"big-business comedy. It's a return to the very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties.\"[11] So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.[11]\n\nOne film critic described the numerous influences: \"From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero trapped in a Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not in a world that seems to have been created by Fritz Lang – the mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in Metropolis (1927).\"[12] An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: \"Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're interested in them – and we're not.\"[3] The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma.[10]\n\nThe first image the Coens and Raimi conceived was of Norville Barnes about to jump from the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him.[13] The inclusion of the hula hoop came as a result of a plot device. Joel remembers, \"We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success.\"[12] Ethan said, \"The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate.\"[12] Joel: \"What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback.\"[12] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project \"takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes.\"[12]\n\nDespite having finished the script in 1985, Joel explained, \"We couldn't make Hudsucker back then because we weren't that popular yet. Plus, the script was too expensive and we had just completed Blood Simple, which was an independent film.\"[14] After completing Barton Fink (1991), the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film.[15] The Hudsucker Proxy was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite. Producer Joel Silver, a fan of the Coens' previous films, acquired the script for his production company, Silver Pictures, and pitched the project at Warner Bros. Pictures. Silver also allowed the Coens complete artistic control.[13]\n\n### Production\n\nThis was the first time the Coen brothers chose big stars to act in one of their films.[16] Joel Silver's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise, but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins.[17] Jon Cryer auditioned for the lead role of Norville Barnes.[18] Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer, before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast.[10][19] Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens's Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink; her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy.[14] To prepare for her role as Amy Archer, Leigh read the biographies of some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn, and Jean Arthur.[11] When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger, \"Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names,\" remembered Joel. \"A lot of them were comedians who were clearly wrong. Mussburger is the bad guy and Paul Newman brought that character to life.\"[14] However, the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood, but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts.[20]  The Coens also offered their longtime friend Bruce Campbell an audition, but he initially refused, writing that \"My history with the Coens spanned more than a decade...I would gladly and willingly accept the role, but these fellows knew my work well enough to spare me the audition.\"  The Coens agreed and Campbell was offered, sans audition, the role of Smitty.  Campbell was later effusive in his praise for the professionalism of the production and the other cast members, as well as being in awe that he was chosen to help Paul Newman rehearse before filming began.[21]\n\nOnce Newman and Robbins signed on, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films agreed to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures.[22] The film was shot on five sound stages at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, beginning on November 30, 1992. Raimi served as second unit director, shooting the hula hoop sequence and Waring Hudsucker's suicide.[14] Production designer Dennis Gassner was influenced by fascist architecture, particularly the work of Albert Speer,  as well as Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985),[13] Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco movement.[23]  Gassner contemplated using five huge rooms needed to accommodate the sound stages. Gassner noted \"You see, we wanted things to be big.\" He said that the huge 1950s-inspired table up in the boardroom was so long, it had to be built in five sections and later on assembled on the soundstage. The intention for the set sizes was to generate an oppressive feel.[16] Principal photography ended on March 18, 1993.[14]\n\nIn addition, numerous sequences were filmed in downtown Chicago, particularly in the Merchandise Mart building for the entrance and lobby to Hudsucker Industries and The Blackstone Hotel Christmas ballroom.[citation needed]\n\nThe presses in the News &amp; Observer building in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, appeared in the movie.[24]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects supervisor was Michael J. McAlister (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Willow) with Mark Stetson (Superman Returns, Peter Pan) as miniatures supervisor. Peter Chesney, mechanical effects designer on many Coen brothers films, created a pair of 16-foot angel wings for actor Charles Durning, who portrayed Waring Hudsucker. \"I made a complicated steel armature with a lot of electric motors to time everything so he can fold up his wings, unfold them and flap them about. Then we covered them with real duck and turkey feathers,\" says Chesney. \"We modeled them after photographs of a hovering dove landing in slow motion.\"[25] The buildings in the background (designed by McAlister and Stetson) were 1:24 scale models, shot separately and merged in post-production. To lengthen the sequence, the model of the Hudsucker building was the equivalent of 90 stories, not 45.[26]\n\nDespite the New York City setting, additional skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois, provided inspiration for the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. \"We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood,\" Gassner continued, \"a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor.\"  First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950s New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of 1950s New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it.[16]  So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew members to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide-angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. \"Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, in the case of the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, that was state-of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers,\" says McAlister.[16] Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they are seen from only the front and the side, and some needed only one side, as they were seen from only the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional.[16][23] The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences.[23]\n\nTo create the two suicide falls, the miniature New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along the heights of the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots would be more effective with a wide-angle lens. \"The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, we liked the shots more and more.\"[23] However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city, leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one-sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera.[23]\n\nThe skyscraper models created for The Hudsucker Proxy were re-used for The Shadow, Batman Forever, Batman &amp; Robin, and Godzilla.[27]\n\n### Inspirations\n\nIt is thought that the inspiration for the scene in which CEO Waring Hudsucker jumps to his death from the company's building was inspired by the real-life suicide of Eli Black, former chairman of United Brands, in 1975.[28]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n| Review scores   | Review scores   |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Source          | Rating          |\n| AllMusic        | link            |\n\nThe score to The Hudsucker Proxy was written by Carter Burwell, the fifth of his collaborations with the Coen Brothers. \"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\" from Aram Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus is the basis of the main theme and additional music from the ballet runs under the Hula-Hoop sequence. The popular music of the time is also reflected in the character of Vic Tenetta (Peter Gallagher), modeled after Dean Martin, who sings \"Memories Are Made of This.\" Additional inspiration comes from Khachaturian's  Gayane suite. A section from the ballet is used by Burwell for the scene in which Norville and Amy meet for the first time. Later, in a montage of the introduction of the hula hoop, Burwell's adaptation of Khachaturian's \"Dance of the Young Kurds\" (from Gayane) is used when sales of the hula hoop are initially slow and when a young boy is the first to try the hula hoop, followed by Burwell's adaptation of Khachaturian's \"Sabre Dance\" (also from Gayane) when the children get excited and rush to the store, rapidly increasing the sales of the hula hoop.[23]\n\n## Release\n\n### Commercial reception\n\nWarner Bros. held test screenings and audience comments were largely mixed. The studio suggested re-shoots, but the Coens, who held final cut privilege, refused because they were very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success. The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor pick-ups for the ending.[14] Variety claimed that the pick-ups were done to try to save the film because Warner feared it was going to be a box office bomb. Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview: \"First of all, they weren't reshoots. They were a little bit of additional footage. We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie. It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie, not previewing it. We've done additional shooting on every movie, so it's normal.\"[14]\n\nThe film premiered in January 1994 at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.[29] In addition, The Hudsucker Proxy opened the 1994 Cannes Film Festival[30] on May 12, 1994. The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or, but lost to Pulp Fiction.[31] The Hudsucker Proxy was released on March 11, 1994, and only grossed $2,816,518 in the United States and Canada.[32] Worldwide, it grossed $11.3 million.[4] The production budget was officially set at $25 million,[14] although, it was reported to have increased to $40 million for marketing and promotion purposes. The film was a box office bomb.[8]\n\n### Critical response\n\nIn addition to the film under-performing at the box office, The Hudsucker Proxy opened to mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes 64% of reviews from 53 critics were positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus states, \"Intriguingly strange and visually distinctive, The Hudsucker Proxy is ultimately almost – but not quite – as smart and absorbing as it needs to be.\"[33]\n\nRoger Ebert praised the production design, scale model work, matte paintings, cinematography, and characters. \"But the problem with the movie is that it's all surface and no substance,\" Ebert wrote. \"Not even the slightest attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously. Everything is style. The performances seem deliberately angled as satire.\"[34] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described The Hudsucker Proxy as being \"pointlessly flashy and compulsively overloaded with references to films of the 1930s. Missing in this film's performances is a sense of humanity, the crucial ingredient in the movies Hudsucker is clearly trying to evoke. Hudsucker isn't the real thing at all. It's just a proxy.\"[35]\n\nJohn Simon of National Review described The Hudsucker Proxy as \"asinine and insufferable\".[36]\n\nTodd McCarthy, writing in Variety, called the film \"one of the most inspired and technically stunning pastiches of old Hollywood pictures ever to come out of the New Hollywood. But a pastiche it remains, as nearly everything in the Coen brothers' latest and biggest film seems like a wizardly but artificial synthesis, leaving a hole in the middle where some emotion and humanity should be.\"[37] James Berardinelli gave a largely positive review. \"The Hudsucker Proxy skewers Big Business on the same shaft that Robert Altman ran Hollywood through with The Player. From the Brazil-like scenes in the cavernous mail room to the convoluted machinations in the board room, this film is pure satire of the nastiest and most enjoyable sort. In this surreal world of 1958 can be found many of the issues confronting large corporations in the 1990s, all twisted to match the filmmakers' vision.\"[38]\n\nWarner Home Video released The Hudsucker Proxy on DVD on May 18, 1999. No featurettes were included.[39] It was one of the first Blu-ray Disc titles released through the Warner Archive Collection on February 26, 2013, but it still lacked any featurettes.[40]\n\nTwo decades after the film's release, Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com praised the film for its stylistic adventurousness and expansion upon the themes and concepts of the films that inspired it. \"Whereas the comedies of the 1930s and '40s could talk quickly and move quickly, they couldn't run at a full gallop like the Coen Brothers. Their camera soars, traveling at the speed of progress, gossip, capitalism itself. Everything races at top speed. The production design, the one thing everyone felt comfortable praising, is a marvel. Every frame doubles as a survey of early modern art, from Art Deco to Futurism.\"[41]\n\n### Year-end lists\n\n- 8th – Stephen Hunter, The Baltimore Sun[42]\n- 8th – Sandi Davis, The Oklahoman[43]\n- 9th – Sean P.

Warner Bros. subsequently agreed to distribute the film, with further financing from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films. Filming at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, lasted from November 1992 to March 1993. The New York City scale model set was designed by Michael J. McAlister and Mark Stetson, with further effects provided by The Computer Film Company.</p>\n            <p>Upon its release in March 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy received mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office, but has since gained a cult following.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Plot</header>\n            <p>In December 1958, Norville Barnes, a business college graduate from Muncie, Indiana, arrives in New York City, looking for a job. He struggles due to lack of experience and becomes a mailroom clerk at Hudsucker Industries, a large corporation. Soon thereafter, the company's founder and president, Waring Hudsucker, unexpectedly commits suicide during a business meeting by jumping out of a top-floor window.</p>\n            <p>Afterward, Sidney J. Mussburger, a ruthless member of the company's board of directors, knowing that Hudsucker Industries' bylaws call for Hudsucker's stock shares to be sold to the public, suggests a scheme to buy the controlling interest in the company by temporarily depressing the stock price by hiring a clearly incompetent president to run the business.</p>\n            <p>In the mailroom, Norville is assigned to deliver a \"Blue Letter\" to Mussburger. The letter is a top-secret communication from Hudsucker, sent shortly before his death. However, Norville does not deliver the letter; instead, he pitches Mussburger an invention of his (indicated with no other explanation than a simple drawing of a circle and his cryptic explanation, \"you know: for kids\"). Believing Norville to be an idiot, Mussburger selects him as a proxy for Hudsucker.</p>\n            <p>Across town, Amy Archer, a brassy Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter for the Manhattan Argus newspaper, is assigned to write a story about Norville and find out what kind of man he really is. She obtains a job at Hudsucker Industries as his personal secretary, pretending to be yet another desperate graduate from his alma mater in Muncie.</p>\n            <p>One night, Amy searches the building for clues and meets Moses, who operates the tower's giant clock and knows \"just about anything if it concerns Hudsucker\". He tells her Mussburger's plot, and she takes the story back to her Chief, but he does not believe it.</p>\n            <p>The other executives at Hudsucker Industries decide to produce Norville's invention in hopes that it will flop and further depress the company's stock. However, the invention is the hula-hoop, which initially fails in obscurity but then becomes an enormous success.</p>\n            <p>Norville allows success to go to his head and becomes yet another uncaring tycoon. Amy, who had fallen for his naive charm, is infuriated over Norville's new attitude and leaves him. Buzz, the eager elevator operator, pitches a new invention: the bendy straw, which Buzz calls the \"Buzz-sucker.\" Norville insults the idea and cruelly fires Buzz, ignoring his pleas that he needs the job.</p>\n            <p>Meanwhile, Aloysius, a Hudsucker janitor, discovers Amy's true identity and informs Mussburger. Mussburger reveals Amy's secret identity to Norville and tells him he will be dismissed as president after the new year. Mussburger also convinces the board that Norville is insane and must be sent to the local psychiatric hospital.</p>\n            <p>On New Year's Eve, Amy finds Norville drunk at a beatnik bar. She apologizes, but he storms out and is chased by an angry mob led by Buzz. Norville escapes to the top floor of the Hudsucker skyscraper and changes back into his mailroom uniform. He climbs out on the ledge, where Aloysius locks him out and watches as he slips and falls off the building at the stroke of midnight.</p>\n            <p>While Norville plummets, Moses stops the building's giant clock, which freezes time. Waring Hudsucker appears to Norville as an angel and tells him to read the Blue Letter (still in Norville's uniform pocket) that was supposed to be delivered to Mussburger: it contains Hudsucker's instructions to transfer his shares to his immediate successor as president, rather than to the public. This would have been Mussburger, but, unaware of this, he proceeded with his scheme to elect Norville.</p>\n            <p>Inside the building's giant clock, Moses fights Aloysius, defeating him. Norville descends safely to the ground. He and Amy reconcile. As 1959 progresses, Mussburger attempts suicide and is sent to an asylum, while Norville develops a new invention for kids: another enigmatic circle on a folded sheet of paper that ultimately turns out to be a frisbee.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Cast</header>\n            <p>- <MainCharacters>Tim Robbins as Norville Barnes</MainCharacters></p>\n            <p>- <MainCharacters>Jennifer Jason Leigh as Amy Archer</MainCharacters></p>\n            <p>- <MainCharacters>Paul Newman as Sidney J.

Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981, and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985), and post-production on Blood Simple (1984), during which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire Sullivan's Travels (1941). The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms. Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). The brothers had no intention of commenting on or parodying such movies. Instead, as Ethan said, \"It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say 'They're really fun - let's do one'; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them.'\" Raimi describes the script as \"big-business comedy. It's a return to the very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties.\" So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.</p>\n            <p>One film critic described the numerous influences: \"From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero trapped in a Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not in a world that seems to have been created by Fritz Lang – the mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in Metropolis (1927).\" An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: \"Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're interested in them – and we're not.\" The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma.</p>\n            <p>The first image the Coens and Raimi conceived was of Norville Barnes about to jump from the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came as a result of a plot device. Joel remembers, \"We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success.\" Ethan said, \"The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate.\" Joel: \"What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback.\" It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project \"takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes.\"</p>\n            <p>Despite having finished the script in 1985, Joel explained, \"We couldn't make Hudsucker back then because we weren't that popular yet. Plus, the script was too expensive and we had just completed Blood Simple, which was an independent film.\" After completing Barton Fink (1991), the Coens were looking forward to doing a more mainstream film. The Hudsucker Proxy was revived and the Coens and Raimi performed a brief rewrite. Producer Joel Silver, a fan of the Coens' previous films, acquired the script for his production company, Silver Pictures, and pitched the project at Warner Bros. Pictures. Silver also allowed the Coens complete artistic control.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Production</header>\n            <p>This was the first time the Coen brothers chose big stars to act in one of their films. Joel Silver's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise, but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins. Jon Cryer auditioned for the lead role of Norville Barnes. Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer, before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast. Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens's Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink; her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for her role as Amy Archer, Leigh read the biographies of some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn, and Jean Arthur. When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger, \"Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names,\" remembered Joel. \"A lot of them were comedians who were clearly wrong. Mussburger is the bad guy and Paul Newman brought that character to life.\" However, the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood, but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts. The Coens also offered their longtime friend Bruce Campbell an audition, but he initially refused, writing that \"My history with the Coens spanned more than a decade...I would gladly and willingly accept the role, but these fellows knew my work well enough to spare me the audition.\" The Coens agreed and Campbell was offered, sans audition, the role of Smitty. Campbell was later effusive in his praise for the professionalism of the production and the other cast members, as well as being in awe that he was chosen to help Paul Newman rehearse before filming began.</p>\n            <p>Once Newman and Robbins signed on, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films agreed to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures. The film was shot on five sound stages at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina, beginning on November 30, 1992. Raimi served as second unit director, shooting the hula hoop sequence and Waring Hudsucker's suicide. Production designer Dennis Gassner was influenced by fascist architecture, particularly the work of Albert Speer, as well as Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985), Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco movement. Gassner contemplated using five huge rooms needed to accommodate the sound stages. Gassner noted \"You see, we wanted things to be big.\" He said that the huge 1950s-inspired table up in the boardroom was so long, it had to be built in five sections and later on assembled on the soundstage. The intention for the set sizes was to generate an oppressive feel. Principal photography ended on March 18, 1993.</p>\n            <p>In addition, numerous sequences were filmed in downtown Chicago, particularly in the Merchandise Mart building for the entrance and lobby to Hudsucker Industries and The Blackstone Hotel Christmas ballroom.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Visual effects</header>\n            <p>The visual effects supervisor was Michael J. McAlister (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Willow) with Mark Stetson (Superman Returns, Peter Pan) as miniatures supervisor. Peter Chesney, mechanical effects designer on many Coen brothers films, created a pair of 16-foot angel wings for actor Charles Durning, who portrayed Waring Hudsucker. \"I made a complicated steel armature with a lot of electric motors to time everything so he can fold up his wings, unfold them and flap them about. Then we covered them with real duck and turkey feathers,\" says Chesney. \"We modeled them after photographs of a hovering dove landing in slow motion.\" The buildings in the background (designed by McAlister and Stetson) were 1:24 scale models, shot separately and merged in post-production. To lengthen the sequence, the model of the Hudsucker building was the equivalent of 90 stories, not 45.</p>\n            <p>Despite the New York City setting, additional skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois, provided inspiration for the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. \"We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood,\" Gassner continued, \"a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor.\" First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950s New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of 1950s New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it. So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew members to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide-angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. \"Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, in the case of the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, that was state-of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers,\" says McAlister. Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they are seen from only the front and the side, and some needed only one side, as they were seen from only the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional.</p>\n            <p>The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences.</p>\n            <p>To create the two suicide falls, the miniature New York set was hung sideways to allow full movement along the heights of the buildings. McAlister calculated that such a drop would take seven seconds, but for dramatic purposes it was extended to around thirty. Problems occurred when the Coens and cinematographer Roger Deakins decided that these shots would be more effective with a wide-angle lens. \"The buildings had been designed for an 18 mm lens, but as we tried a 14 mm lens, and then a 10 mm, we liked the shots more and more.\" However, the wider amount of vision meant that the edges of the frame went beyond the fringes of the model city, leaving empty spaces with no buildings. In the end, extra buildings were created from putting the one-sided buildings together and placing them at the edges. Charles Durning's fall was shot conventionally, but because Tim Robbins had to stop abruptly at the camera, his was shot in reverse as he was pulled away from the camera.</p>\n            <p>The skyscraper models created for The Hudsucker Proxy were re-used for The Shadow, Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, and Godzilla.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Inspirations</header>\n            <p>It is thought that the inspiration for the scene in which CEO Waring Hudsucker jumps to his death from the company's building was inspired by the real-life suicide of Eli Black, former chairman of United Brands, in 1975.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Soundtrack</header>\n            <p>The score to The Hudsucker Proxy was written by Carter Burwell, the fifth of his collaborations with the Coen Brothers. \"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\" from Aram Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus is the basis of the main theme and additional music from the ballet runs under the Hula-Hoop sequence. The popular music of the time is also reflected in the character of Vic Tenetta (Peter Gallagher), modeled after Dean Martin, who sings \"Memories Are Made of This.\" Additional inspiration comes from Khachaturian's Gayane suite. A section from the ballet is used by Burwell for the scene in which Norville and Amy meet for the first time. Later, in a montage of the introduction of the hula hoop, Burwell's adaptation of Khachaturian's \"Dance of the Young Kurds\" (from Gayane) is used when sales of the hula hoop are initially slow and when a young boy is the first to try the hula hoop, followed by Burwell's adaptation of Khachaturian's \"Sabre Dance\" (also from Gayane) when the children get excited and rush to the store, rapidly increasing the sales of the hula hoop.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Release</header>\n            <p>Warner Bros. held test screenings and audience comments were largely mixed. The studio suggested re-shoots, but the Coens, who held final cut privilege, refused because they were very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success. The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor pick-ups for the ending. Variety claimed that the pick-ups were done to try to save the film because Warner feared it was going to be a box office bomb. Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview: \"First of all, they weren't reshoots. They were a little bit of additional footage. We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie. It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie, not previewing it. We've done additional shooting on every movie, so it's normal.\"</p>\n            <p>The film premiered in January 1994 at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. In addition, The Hudsucker Proxy opened the 1994 Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 1994. The film was in competition for the Palme d'Or, but lost to Pulp Fiction. The Hudsucker Proxy was released on March 11, 1994, and only grossed $2,816,518 in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, it grossed $11.3 million. The production budget was officially set at $25 million, although, it was reported to have increased to $40 million for marketing and promotion purposes. The film was a box office bomb.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Critical response</header>\n            <p>In addition to the film under-performing at the box office, The Hudsucker Proxy opened to mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes 64% of reviews from 53 critics were positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus states, \"Intriguingly strange and visually distinctive, The Hudsucker Proxy is ultimately almost – but not quite – as smart and absorbing as it needs to be.\"</p>\n            <p>Roger Ebert praised the production design, scale model work, matte paintings, cinematography, and characters. \"But the problem with the movie is that it's all surface and no substance,\" Ebert wrote. \"Not even the slightest attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously. Everything is style. The performances seem deliberately angled as satire.\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described The Hudsucker Proxy as being \"pointlessly flashy and compulsively overloaded with references to films of the 1930s. Missing in this film's performances is a sense of humanity, the crucial ingredient in the movies Hudsucker is clearly trying to evoke. Hudsucker isn't the real thing at all. It's just a proxy.\"</p>\n            <p>John Simon of National Review described The Hudsucker Proxy as \"asinine and insufferable\". Todd McCarthy, writing in Variety, called the film \"one of the most inspired and technically stunning pastiches of old Hollywood pictures ever to come out of the New Hollywood. But a pastiche it remains, as nearly everything in the Coen brothers' latest and biggest film seems like a wizardly but artificial synthesis, leaving a hole in the middle where some emotion and humanity should be.\" James Berardinelli gave a largely positive review. \"The Hudsucker Proxy skewers Big Business on the same shaft that Robert Altman ran Hollywood through with The Player. From the Brazil-like scenes in the cavernous mail room to the convoluted machinations in the board room, this film is pure satire of the nastiest and most enjoyable sort. In this surreal world of 1958 can be found many of the issues confronting large corporations in the 1990s, all twisted to match the filmmakers' vision.\"</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <header>Year-end lists</header>\n            <p>- 8th – Stephen Hunter, The Baltimore Sun</p>\n            <p>- 8th – Sandi Davis, The Oklahoman</p>\n            <p>- 9th – Sean P.

It stars Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt, and Christopher Plummer. Set in a post-apocalyptic future devastated by disease, the film follows a convict who is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.\n\n| 12 Monkeys                | 12 Monkeys                                                 |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Theatrical release poster | Theatrical release poster                                  |\n| Directed by               | Terry Gilliam                                              |\n| Screenplay by             | David Peoples Janet Peoples                                |\n| Based on                  | La Jetée by Chris Marker                                   |\n| Produced by               | Charles Roven                                              |\n| Starring                  | Bruce Willis Madeleine Stowe Brad Pitt Christopher Plummer |\n| Cinematography            | Roger Pratt                                                |\n| Edited by                 | Mick Audsley                                               |\n| Music by                  | Paul Buckmaster                                            |\n| Production companies      | Atlas Entertainment Classico Entertainment                 |\n| Distributed by            | Universal Pictures                                         |\n| Release date              | December 29, 1995 (1995-12-29)                             |\n| Running time              | 129 minutes                                                |\n| Country                   | United States                                              |\n| Language                  | English                                                    |\n| Budget                    | $29 million[1]                                             |\n| Box office                | $168.8 million[2]                                          |\n\nThe film was theatrically released in the US on December 29, 1995, by Universal Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $168.8 million worldwide against a $29 million budget. At the 68th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (for Pitt) and Best Costume Design. It garnered 7 nominations at the 22nd Saturn Awards, Winn 3: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Costumes. Pitt also won Best Supporting Actor at the 53rd Golden Globe Awards.\n\n## Plot\n\nA deadly virus released in 1996 wiped out almost all of humanity, forcing survivors to live underground. A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. In 2035, James Cole is a prisoner living in an underground compound beneath Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be sent back in time to find the original virus to help scientists develop a cure in exchange for a reduced sentence. Cole is troubled by dreams involving a foot chase and a shooting at an airport.\n\nCole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested and incarcerated at a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with extreme environmentalist and anti-corporate views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors and tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened and cannot be prevented.\n\nAfter an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell but he disappears and awakens back in 2035. He  is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the 12 Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole another chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. Cole briefly arrives at a battlefield during World War I, where he sees another prison inmate who was sent back in time, José. Cole is shot in the leg and gets transported to 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book-signing, Railly meets Dr. Peters, who tells her that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision while humanity's gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy.\n\nCole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it. When Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the 12 Monkeys before they set out in search of him. When Cole confronts Goines, he denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990, Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father, Dr. Leland Goines.\n\nCole is transported back to 2035, where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission and asks to be sent back to complete it. When he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her that he now believes himself crazy as she had suggested. Railly has discovered evidence of his time travel to the Great War which she shows him, believing he is sane. They decide to depart for the Florida Keys before the start of the plague.\n\nCole and Railly learn that the Army of the 12 Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a message telling the scientists that they are on the wrong track following the Army of the 12 Monkeys and he will not return. Cole is confronted by José, who gives Cole a handgun and instructs him to follow orders. Railly spots Dr. Peters at the airport and recognizes him from a newspaper as an assistant of Goines' father. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that matches the viral outbreaks chronologically and geographically.\n\nCole is informed of Peters by Railly, then forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. Cole draws his gun, then is shot by police. As he lies dying in Railly's arms, she scans the crowd around her. She makes eye contact with a small boy: the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future, who comments that her job is \"insurance\". The young Cole watches a plane take off from the ground outside the airport.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Bruce Willis as James Cole\n    - Joseph Melito as young James Cole\n- Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly\n- Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines\n- Christopher Plummer as Dr. Leland Goines\n- David Morse as Dr. Peters\n- Jon Seda as Jose\n- Christopher Meloni as Lt.

Kosberg persuaded that film's director, Chris Marker, to let him pitch the project to Universal Pictures, seeing it as a perfect basis for a full-length science fiction film. Universal agreed to purchase the remake rights and hired David and Janet Peoples to write the screenplay.[3] Producer Charles Roven chose Terry Gilliam to direct, because he believed the filmmaker's style was perfect for 12 Monkeys' nonlinear storyline and time travel subplot.[4] Gilliam had just abandoned a film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities when he signed to direct 12 Monkeys.[5] Though Gilliam felt the script was \"too complex\" to take on.[6]\n\nThe film represents the second film for which Gilliam did not write or co-write the screenplay. Although he prefers to direct his own scripts, he was captivated by Peoples' \"intriguing and intelligent script. The story is disconcerting. It deals with time, madness and a perception of what the world is or isn't. It is a study of madness and dreams, of death and re-birth, set in a world coming apart\".[4]\n\nUniversal took longer than expected to approve 12 Monkeys, although Gilliam had two stars (Willis and Pitt) and a firm budget of $29.5 million (low for a Hollywood science fiction film). Universal's production of Waterworld (1995) had resulted in various cost overruns. To get 12 Monkeys approved for production, Gilliam persuaded Willis to lower his normal asking price.[7] Because of Universal's strict production incentives and his history with the studio on Brazil, Gilliam received final cut privilege. The Writers Guild of America was skeptical of the \"inspired by\" credit for La Jetée and Chris Marker.[8] Gilliam said that he had not seen La Jetée when he made 12 Monkeys.[9]\n\n### Casting\n\nGilliam's initial casting choices were Nick Nolte as James Cole and Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Goines, but Universal objected.[5] Other actors were suggested for the roles included Nicolas Cage and Tom Cruise, but Gilliam rejected the choices.[10] Gilliam, who first met Bruce Willis while casting Jeff Bridges' role in The Fisher King (1991), believed Willis evoked Cole's characterization as being \"somebody who is strong and dangerous but also vulnerable\".[4] Gilliam later stated that he wasn't originally interested in casting Willis because of the actor's mouth.[11]\n\nGilliam cast Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly because he was impressed by her performance in Blink (1994).[4] The director first met Stowe when he was casting his abandoned film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities.[5] \"She has this incredible ethereal beauty and she's incredibly intelligent\", Gilliam said of Stowe. \"Those two things rest very easily with her, and the film needed those elements because it has to be romantic.\"[4]\n\nGilliam originally believed that Pitt was not right for the role of Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise.[5] Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still relatively unknown at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys' release, Interview with the Vampire (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple University's hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role.[4]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe Senator Theatre was used as a filming location.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography lasted from February 8 to May 6, 1995. Shooting on location in Philadelphia and Baltimore (including the Senator Theatre)[1][12] in winter was fraught with weather problems. There were also technical glitches with the futuristic mechanical props. Because the film has a nonlinear storyline, continuity errors occurred, and some scenes had to be reshot. Gilliam also injured himself when he went horseback riding. Despite setbacks, the director managed to stay within the budget and was only a week behind his shooting schedule. \"It was a tough shoot\", acknowledged Jeffrey Beecroft, the film's production designer. \"There wasn't a lot of money or enough time. Terry is a perfectionist, but he was really adamant about not going over budget. He got crucified for Munchausen, and that still haunts him.\"[1]\n\nThe filmmakers were not allowed access to sound stages; thus, they had to find abandoned buildings or landmarks to use.[8] The exteriors of the climactic airport scene were shot at the Baltimore–Washington International Airport, while the interior scenes were shot at the Pennsylvania Convention Center (formerly Reading Terminal). Filming at the psychiatric hospital was done at the Eastern State Penitentiary and Girard College.[13] Some shots took place in abandoned motels in Camden, New Jersey.[14][15] 12 Monkeys was shot in the 1.85:1 format rather than anamorphic.[16]\n\n### Design\n\nGilliam used the same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), including the art direction and cinematography (specifically using Fresnel lenses).[7] The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists was based on the work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a \"nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear. To me that's the world we live in, the way we communicate these days, through technical devices that pretend to be about communication but may not be\".[17]\n\nThe art department made sure that the 2035 underground world only used pre-1996 technology, to depict the bleakness of the future. Gilliam, Beecroft and set decorator Crispian Sallis went to several flea markets and salvage warehouses looking for materials to decorate the sets.[4] The majority of visual effects sequences were created by Peerless Camera Company, which Gilliam founded in the late 1970s with Kent Houston, the film's visual effects supervisor.[16] Additional digital compositing was done by The Mill, while Cinesite provided film scanning services.[4]\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed, arranged, and conducted by English musician Paul Buckmaster. The main theme is based on Argentine tango musician/composer Astor Piazzolla's Suite Punta del Este.[18]\n\n## Themes\n\n### Thematic elements\n\nCole has been thrust from another world into ours and he's confronted by the confusion we live in, which most people somehow accept as normal. So he appears abnormal, and what's happening around him seems random and weird. Is he mad or are we?\n\nIn the biographical novel Gilliam on Gilliam, director Terry Gilliam described the film as \"very much about the twentieth century's inundation of information and about deciphering what among all this noise and imagery is useful and important to our lives\"; these themes are expressed in conflicts between the protagonist and antagonistic elements in the relative 'past' and 'future'.[7]\n\nReferences to time, time travel, and monkeys are scattered throughout the film, including the Woody Woodpecker cartoon \"Time Tunnel\" playing on the TV in a hotel room, the Marx Brothers film Monkey Business (1931) on TV in the asylum, and the subplots involving monkeys (drug testing, news stories and animal rights).\n\n### Allusions to other films and media\n\n12 Monkeys is inspired by the French short film La Jetée (1962); as in La Jetée, characters are haunted by the images of their own deaths.[13] Like La Jetée, 12 Monkeys contains references to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). Toward the end of the film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon and watch scenes from Vertigo and The Birds. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy (Kim Novak) transforms herself into blonde Madeleine in Vertigo; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie (James Stewart) saw Judy emerge within a green light.[13] Brief notes of Bernard Herrmann's film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore in the first part of Vertigo. The scene at Muir Woods National Monument, where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in 12 Monkeys. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from Vertigo is repeated.[13] The Muir Woods scene in Vertigo is also reenacted in La Jetée. In a previous scene in the film, Cole wakes up in a hospital bed with the scientists talking to him in chorus. This is a direct homage to the \"Dry Bones\" scene in Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective.[19] James Cole is a notable Christ figure in the film.[20][21] The film is significant in the genre of science-fiction film noir, and it alludes to various \"canonical noir\" films.[22]\n\n## Release\n\n### Home media\n\nUniversal Pictures released 12 Monkeys on VHS on January 28, 1997.[23][better source needed] It was also released on a \"Signature Collection\" LaserDisc of the film on February 18, 1997, containing an audio commentary by director Terry Gilliam and producer Charles Roven, The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys (a making-of documentary), an archive of production art, and production notes.[24]\nIt was first released on DVD on March 31, 1998, containing the same extras as the LaserDisc.[25][better source needed] It was re-released as a Special Edition DVD on May 10, 2005, with a new transfer of the film and identical extras.[26] It was also released on HD DVD on March 4, 2008, with the same extras.[25] It was released on Blu-ray Disc on July 28, 2009, with the same extras.[25] Arrow Films released a new Blu-ray of the film on October 15, 2018, containing a new transfer of the film, remastered in 4K from the original negative, all of the previous extras, as well as a vintage 1996 interview with Terry Gilliam, and an interview with Gilliam scholar Ian Christie.[27]\n\n### Lebbeus Woods lawsuit\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Cole is brought into an interrogation room and told to sit in a chair attached to a vertical rail on the wall. A spherical machine with screens of varying sizes showing close-ups of the faces of the scientists interrogating Cole, supported by a metal armature is suspended directly in front of him, probing for weaknesses as the inquisitors interrogate him.[28] Architect Lebbeus Woods filed a lawsuit against Universal in February 1996, claiming that his work \"Neomechanical Tower (Upper) Chamber\" was used without permission. Woods won his lawsuit, requiring Universal to remove the scenes, but he ultimately allowed their inclusion in exchange for a \"high six-figure cash settlement\" from Universal.[28][29]\n\n### Trilogy claims\n\nAfter the release of The Zero Theorem in 2013, claims were made that Gilliam had meant it as part of a trilogy. A 2013 review for The Guardian said, \"Calling it [The Zero Theorem] the third part of a trilogy formed by earlier dystopian satires Brazil and Twelve Monkeys [sic]\";[30] but in an interview with Alex Suskind for Indiewire in late 2014, Gilliam said, \"Well, it's funny, this trilogy was never something I ever said, but it's been repeated so often it's clearly true [laughs]. I don't know who started it but once it started it never stopped\".[31]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\n12 Monkeys grossed $57.14 million in the United States and Canada, and $111.69 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $168.83 million.[2] The film held the No. 1 spot on box office charts for two weeks in January, before dropping due to competition from From Dusk till Dawn, Mr. Holland's Opus, and Black Sheep.[32]\n\n### Critical response\n\nBrad Pitt received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award nomination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 73 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The plot's a bit of a jumble, but excellent performances and mind-blowing plot twists make 12 Monkeys a kooky, effective experience.\"[33] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[34] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[35]\n\nThe film's startling depiction of the world in 2035—where human life has been driven underground by a 1990s viral outbreak that annihilated 99% of human life—may not always make sense. But 12 Monkeys rattles with insightful sound and fury, and its bleak visions are hard to shake.\n\nRoger Ebert found 12 Monkeys' depiction of the future similar to Blade Runner (1982, also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985, also directed by Terry Gilliam). \"The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate\", Ebert wrote. \"This vision is a cold, dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, and the more you know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. [...] And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses.\"[37]\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times stated, \"This apocalyptic nightmare, a vigorous work of dark, surprise-filled science fiction, is much tougher and less fanciful than the director's films have often been. [...] 12 Monkeys is fierce and disturbing, with a plot that skillfully resists following any familiar course. The film's hero fears that he's half-crazy, and for two hours Mr. Gilliam artfully keeps his audience feeling the same way.\"[38] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised the art direction and set design. \"Willis and Pitt's performances, Gilliam's atmospherics and an exhilarating momentum easily outweigh such trifling flaws in the script\", Thomson wrote.[39] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone magazine attributes the film's success to Gilliam's direction and Willis' performance.[40] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli believed the filmmakers had an intelligent and creative motive for the time-travel subplot. Rather than being sent to change the past, James Cole is instead observing it to make a better future.[41] Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film's time-travel aspect and apocalyptic depiction of a bleak future were clichés. \"In its frantic mix of chaos, carnage and zoo animals, 12 Monkeys is Jumanji for adults\", Corliss wrote.[42]\n\n## Accolades\n\nBrad Pitt was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Kevin Spacey for The Usual Suspects. Julie Weiss was also nominated for but lost to James Acheson for Restoration.[43] However, Pitt won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture.[44] Terry Gilliam was honored for his direction at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.[13]\n\nThe film also received positive notices from the science fiction community. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation[45] and the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films awarded it the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film at the 22nd Saturn Awards. Pitt and Weiss won awards at the ceremony as well; Gilliam, Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and writers David and Janet Peoples also received nominations.[46]\n\n## Television series\n\nActor Aaron Stanford, who portrays James Cole in the television adaptation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn August 26, 2013, Entertainment Weekly announced that Syfy was developing a 12 Monkeys television series based on the film. Production began in November 2013. The pilot was written by Terry Matalas and Travis Fickett, who had previously written for the series Terra Nova. Due to the series being labeled as \"cast contingent\", the series did not move forward until the roles of Cole and Goines were cast.[47] In April 2014, Syfy green-lighted the first season, which consisted of 13 episodes, including the pilot filmed in 2013. The series premiered on January 16, 2015.[48] On March 12, 2015, the series was renewed for a second season that began airing in April 2016.[49] Actress Madeleine Stowe  made an appearance in one Season 2 episode, being the only cast member of the film to appear on the series.[50] On June 29, 2016, the series was renewed for a 10-episode third season, set to premiere in 2017.[51] The third season aired over three consecutive nights, from May 19 to May 21, 2017. A fourth and final season was announced on March 16, 2017. The eleven-episode fourth season ran from June 15 to July 6, 2018.[52]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c Gerston, Jill (December 24, 1995). \"FILM; Terry Gilliam: Going Mainstream (Sort Of)\".

A group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to have released the virus. In 2035, <Character>James Cole</Character> is a prisoner living in an underground compound beneath Philadelphia. Cole is selected to be sent back in time to find the original virus to help scientists develop a cure in exchange for a reduced sentence. Cole is troubled by dreams involving a foot chase and a shooting at an airport.\n\n        Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested and incarcerated at a mental hospital on the diagnosis of <Character>Dr. Kathryn Railly</Character>. There he encounters <Character>Jeffrey Goines</Character>, a mental patient with extreme environmentalist and anti-corporate views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors and tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened and cannot be prevented.\n\n        After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell but he disappears and awakens back in 2035. He is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the 12 Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole another chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. Cole briefly arrives at a battlefield during World War I, where he sees another prison inmate who was sent back in time, José. Cole is shot in the leg and gets transported to 1996.\n\n        In 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book-signing, Railly meets <Character>Dr. Peters</Character>, who tells her that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision while humanity's gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy.\n\n        Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it. When Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the 12 Monkeys before they set out in search of him. When Cole confronts Goines, he denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990, Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father, <Character>Dr. Leland Goines</Character>.\n\n        Cole is transported back to 2035, where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission and asks to be sent back to complete it. When he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her that he now believes himself crazy as she had suggested. Railly has discovered evidence of his time travel to the Great War which she shows him, believing he is sane. They decide to depart for the Florida Keys before the start of the plague.\n\n        Cole and Railly learn that the Army of the 12 Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a message telling the scientists that they are on the wrong track following the Army of the 12 Monkeys and he will not return. Cole is confronted by José, who gives Cole a handgun and instructs him to follow orders. Railly spots Dr. Peters at the airport and recognizes him from a newspaper as an assistant of Goines' father. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that matches the viral outbreaks chronologically and geographically.\n\n        Cole is informed of Peters by Railly, then forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. Cole draws his gun, then is shot by police. As he lies dying in Railly's arms, she scans the crowd around her. She makes eye contact with a small boy: the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones, one of the scientists from the future, who comments that her job is \"insurance\". The young Cole watches a plane take off from the ground outside the airport.\n    </Plot>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key information is clearly highlighted and easy to read.

It’s not by accident that one of the most memorable lines of dialogue during the movie’s relatively talk-free runtime refers sarcastically to human error, and what is funnier than showcasing the absurdity, futility and the flaws that make us mortal?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossibly the most aped, so to speak, of 2001‘s moments is its famous cut from a bone thrown into the air to a spaceship. It’s commonly described, thanks to additional information provided in the concurrently written novel by Arthur C. Clarke, as a depiction of the evolution of weaponry; a bone used to smash skulls that transitions over time to a space weapons platform. The movie, however, offers no obvious cues that it is a warship; the book pays it off by having the starchild mentally detonate all space-based artillery in the final chapter. This transition is, rather, an absurdity–a funhouse version of the creationist intelligent design viewpoint that says God must exist because it’s ridiculous to think apes became humans by random mutation. Director Stanley Kubrick sees the absurdity of bone-slinging apes becoming spacefarers in the blink of an eye, relative to infinite time, and suggests that indeed, intelligent design helped things along, but it wasn’t God…just something so advanced we would regard it as such. We are, after all, dumb apes.\nNot every joke is that sophisticated. When I was a child watching 2001, I laughed at the zero-gravity toilet because, huh-huh, toilets are funny. Later in life, I though it was just part of the overall obsession with minutiae Kubrick had, and not a cheap gag. Nowadays, I tend to think it’s both: Kubrick could have indicated a lavatory without further detail, but the fact that it sports detailed instructions for using a zero-gravity toilet seems clearly designed to make the viewer imagine the difficulty, and laugh at how one of the most notable challenges of space travel might be something as simple as taking a dump. Classically, comedy is defined by shining a light on the base desires and needs that make us human, and Greek playwrights frequently used the form to bring deities down to earth…and the bathroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome humor plays differently now than it did in 1968: the notion of a phone call from space costing $1.70 was funny because it was expensive; now it’s funny because it seems so cheap. The absurdity of a world in which a bush baby can be obtained easily as a pet still holds, though there’s accidental humor in the fact that the actual president in the real year 2001 turned out to be a “Bush baby.” But the notion that astronauts, upon finding an alien artifact, immediately make it their first impulse to take a picture of themselves with it? That might have been the most accurate, on-point prediction of the millennium, though Kubrick instantly smashes the human ego on display by having the Monolith promptly deafen our would-be selfie pioneers, whom we never see again.\nLeonard Rossiter’s appearance as a Russian scientist might not mean much to non anglophiles–in the UK, he’s best known for starring in TV comedies, though at the time he was relatively new to them, having been a classical stage actor prior. Still, imagine Patrick Stewart suddenly showing up in a serious sci-fi movie as a nervous Russian, and you get a sense of how British audiences might have received the scene with Dr. Smyslov. Kubrick would undoubtedly have been in on the joke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has never been fully confirmed as to whether the name of HAL the computer is a riff on IBM, with each letter in the name being one letter prior in alphabetical order (HI, AB, LM). However, what is clear, and made clearer by the sequel and the books, though supporting evidence is onscreen in the first film, is that HAL is presented with evidence of his own fallibility. That’s a classic comedy device, and he reacts by proving just how vulnerable the humans in his care are by attempting to dispose of them. When that fails to take them all out, and the last survivor deactivates him, his fallibility is even further and more comedically exposed, as he regresses to “childhood” singing a simple song.\nOther than the odd contrast that advanced aliens would assume a cold, ornate hotel suite makes a perfect zoo cage for a human specimen (intelligent design coming full circle, in a way), the final section of the film isn’t necessarily funny or satirical, but it does bring home human vulnerability in an allegorical way. We anticipate our own mortality, unlike other animals, and Dave Bowman does so literally, seeing each steadily older version of himself outside his body before becoming that next person. He’s finally “born again” in what once more passes as a funhouse mirror of a religious idea; Jesus (as far as we can tell) hasn’t renewed him as a baby into eternal life, but something has.\n\nThe final image is of a man become a godlike being, having been brought down into vulnerable positions many times over to get there. It’s the “scheintod,” or fake death, of heroic narratives that end in the hero surviving, and subsequently re-attaining divine or royal status, contrasted with the visual of a baby. We’ve seen a species develop from metaphorical infancy; literal infancy starts a whole new cycle, and new vulnerability.\nLuke Y.

It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.\n\nThe screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science of Interstellar. It was Lynda Obst's final film as producer before her death. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.\n\nInterstellar was released in theaters on November 7, 2014. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews and grossed $681 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014.  Among its various accolades, Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the mid-21st century, humanity faces extinction due to dust storms and widespread crop blights. Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA test pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald. Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that the Apollo missions were not fabricated. During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to a ghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that, 48 years earlier, a wormhole appeared near Saturn, leading to a system in another galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers of the Lazarus expedition had previously travelled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results.\n\nCooper is enlisted to pilot the Endurance spacecraft through the wormhole as part of a mission to colonize a habitable planet with 5,000 frozen embryos and ensure humanity's survival. Meanwhile, Professor Brand would continue his work on solving a gravity equation whose solution would supposedly enable construction of spacecraft for an exodus from Earth. Cooper accepts against Murph's wishes and promises to return. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.\n\nThe crew, consisting of Cooper, robots TARS and CASE, and scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle, traverse the wormhole after a two-year voyage to Saturn. Cooper, Doyle and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines.\n\nBy the time they leave the planet, Cooper and Brand discover that 23 years have elapsed on the Endurance. Having enough fuel left for only one of the other two planets, they vote to go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting. En route, they receive messages from Earth and Cooper watches Tom grow up, get married, and lose his first son. An adult Murph is now a scientist working on the gravity equation with Professor Brand. On his deathbed, Brand confesses that the Endurance crew was never supposed to return, knowing that a complete solution to the equation was not feasible without observations of gravitational singularities from inside a black hole.\n\nOn Mann's planet, they awaken him from cryostasis, and he assures them that colonization is possible, despite the extreme environment. During a scouting mission, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified his data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race back to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance, but Cooper is able to regain control of the station through his own docking maneuver.\n\nWith insufficient fuel, Cooper and Brand resort to a slingshot around Gargantua, which costs them 51 years due to time dilation. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison their landers to lighten the Endurance so that Brand and CASE may reach Edmunds' planet. Falling into Gargantua's event horizon, they eject from their craft and find themselves in a tesseract made up of infinite copies of Murph's bedroom across moments in time. Cooper deduces that the tesseract was constructed by advanced humans in the far future, and realizes that he had always been Murph's \"ghost\". He uses Morse code to manipulate the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, giving Murphy the data that TARS collected, which enables her to complete Brand's solution.\n\nThe tesseract, its purpose fulfilled, collapses before ejecting Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes up on a station orbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murph, now on her deathbed, who tells him to seek out Brand. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up the human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  played the protagonists of .\n\n- Matthew McConaughey as Joseph \"Coop\" Cooper,[a] a widowed NASA pilot who reluctantly becomes a farmer after the agency was closed by the government, and eventually joins the Endurance mission as the lead pilot\n- Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, Professor Brand's daughter and NASA scientist who, aboard the Endurance mission,  is responsible for conducting planet colonization[4]\n- Jessica Chastain as Murphy \"Murph\" Cooper, Joseph's daughter, who eventually becomes a NASA scientist working under Professor Brand\n    - Ellen Burstyn as elderly Murph\n    - Mackenzie Foy as 10-year-old Murph\n- John Lithgow as Donald, Cooper's elderly father-in-law\n- Michael Caine as Professor John Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, father of Amelia, former mentor of Cooper, and director of the Lazarus and Endurance missions\n- Casey Affleck as Tom Cooper, Joseph's son, who eventually takes charge of his father's farm\n    - Timothée Chalamet as 15-year-old Tom\n- Wes Bentley as Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member, and Endurance crew member\n- Bill Irwin as TARS (voice and puppetry) and CASE (puppetry), robots assigned to assist the crew of the Endurance\n- Topher Grace as Getty, Murph's colleague and love interest\n- David Gyasi as Professor Romilly, a high-ranking NASA member, and Endurance crew member\n- Matt Damon as Dr. Mann, a NASA astronaut sent to an icy planet during the Lazarus program\n\nAlso appearing are Josh Stewart as the voice of CASE; Leah Cairns as Lois, Tom's wife; Liam Dickinson as Coop, Tom's son; David Oyelowo and Collette Wolfe respectively as school principal and teacher Ms. Hanley; Francis X.

Obst was attached to produce.[8][9] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[10]\n\nAfter Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[11] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[12] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[13] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[14] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[15] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[16] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[17] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[12]\n\nWarner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate \"A-list\" property.[18] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.[19]\n\n### Writing and casting\n\nThe Dust Bowl phenomenon of the 1930s, as documented by Ken Burns in The Dust Bowl (2012), served as inspiration for the blight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.[5] To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology.[20] He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009). Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\"[11]\n\nHis brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne. He picked what he felt, as director, he could get \"across to the audience and hopefully not lose them\", before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.[12][21] Christopher kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource-depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.[5] He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.[5] After watching the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration, Christopher contacted the director, Ken Burns, and the producer, Dayton Duncan. They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar.[22]\n\nChristopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom \"the audience could experience the story\".[23] He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud,[23] which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.[5] Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective.[24] Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan's home, where she read the script for Interstellar.[25] In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.[26] Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.[25] Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.[27]\n\n### Principal photography\n\nNolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography.[28] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014);[29] Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films.[30]\nMore IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[23] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes.[5] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet.[31]\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy.\"[32] As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora's Letter,[33] Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.[12]\n\nThe Svínafellsjökull glacier in Iceland was used as a filming location for Interstellar, doubling for Mann's planet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film's principal photography was scheduled to last four months.[27] It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada.[19] Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza.[33] For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene,[11] intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.[12] Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.[34] Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.[33]\n\nShooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005).[35] It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.[5] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg).[12] They spent two weeks shooting there,[27] during which a crew of about 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur.[36][37] While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered from hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured.[12]\n\nAfter the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew shot in Los Angeles for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California.[38] Principal photography concluded in December 2013.[39] Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.[12]\n\n### Production design\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  spacecraft () is based on the  ().\n\nInterstellar features three spacecraft— the Endurance, a ranger, and a lander. The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"[5]\n\nThe film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. He said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, with his image digitally removed, and Josh Stewart replaced his voicing for CASE.[5] The human space habitats resemble O'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1976.[40]\n\n### Sound design\n\nGregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film's audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process.[41] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment[42] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.[11] The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel.\"[43] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.[44]\n\n### Music\n\nHans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison &amp; Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score.[45][46] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.[11]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar.[47] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens.[5] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.[48]\n\nThe ranger, Endurance, and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig.[49] New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.[48]\n\n## Influences\n\nNolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982),[50] Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979).[51] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,[52] who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature.[53] He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production,[5] following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.[12] Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.[54] Clark Kent's upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.[21] Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.[12]\n\n## Scientific accuracy\n\nKip Thorne, a theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations\".[55] Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations [...] would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.[9] At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.[56] According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.[9]\n\nThe astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.[57] Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it\".[58] The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said Interstellar \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come\". Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent\".[59]\n\n### Wormholes and black holes\n\nMiller's planet orbiting Gargantua\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data.[6] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature[60]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[61] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.[62][63][64]\n\nThe first image of the event horizon of a black hole, obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. The asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is well visible here.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.[65] Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.[66]\n\nAs a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image[67] of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. Futura-Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.[68]\n\nAccording to Space.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.[69]\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character, Cooper.[70] The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C., and was made available online later that month. For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube.[71]\n\nChristopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014 to promote Interstellar. That same month, Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website, on which users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo 11 Moon landing.[72]\n\nIn October 2014, Paramount partnered with Google to promote Interstellar across multiple platforms.[73] The film's website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain,[74] which collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app.[74] It featured a game in which players could build Solar System models and use a flight simulator for space travel.[75] The Paramount–Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content, made available in 2015.[76] The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools.[73][77]\n\nParamount provided a virtual reality walkthrough of the Endurance spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology. It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., from October 6 through November 19, 2014.[78][79] The publisher Running Press released Interstellar: Beyond Time and Space, a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film, on November 11.[80] W. W. Norton &amp; Company released The Science of Interstellar, a book by Thorne;[81] Titan Books released the official novelization, written by Greg Keyes;[82] and Wired magazine released a tie-in online comic, Absolute Zero, written by Christopher Nolan and drawn by Sean Gordon Murphy. The comic is a prequel to the film, with Mann as the protagonist.[83]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nBefore Interstellar's public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at the AMC Lincoln Square IMAX theater in Manhattan, New York.[84][85] Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22.[86] On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild.[87] The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles,[88] and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London.[89][90]\n\nInterstellar was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America on November 5, with a wide release on November 7.[91] The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the UK on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days.[92] For the limited North American release, Interstellar was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[93] Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[28] The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[94][95] until surpassed by Universal Pictures' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[96]\n\nInterstellar was an exception to Paramount Pictures' goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format.[97] According to Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter, the initiative to project Interstellar on film stock would help preserve an endangered format,[93] which was supported by Christopher Nolan, J.

Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers.[98] McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as \"backward\", as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.[99]\n\nInterstellar was re-released in theaters on December 6, 2024, for its 10th anniversary, showing in 70 mm IMAX and digital formats.[100][101] At the weekend box office, the re-release grossed $14 million worldwide, boosting the film's total box office figure to $720 million globally.[102] With the re-release, the film also crossed the $200 million box office threshold in the United States, and has gone on to be the highest-grossing IMAX re-release of all time, accumulating $24.4 million at the worldwide box office, as of December 20, 2024.[103][104]\n\n### Home media\n\nInterstellar was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States.[105] It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks.[106][107] It was reported that Interstellar was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent.[108] It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.[109]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nInterstellar grossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $493 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $681 million on original release, against a production budget of $165 million.[3] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit to be $47 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it 20th on their list of 2014's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[110] It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.[111]\n\nThe film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17 million record held by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), and is the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release.[112] It had a worldwide opening of $133 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014,[113] and became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014.[114] Interstellar is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales.[115][116][117] It was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.5 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of The Dark Knight Rises (£14.4 million), Gravity (£6.2 million), and Inception (£5.9 million).[118] The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total.[119] Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $83 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets.[120] It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater.[121] It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million),[122] Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million).[123] Interstellar was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan's biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of The Dark Knight Rises.[124][125] It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share.[126][127] It is Nolan's biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.' biggest 2D opening,[128] and the studio's third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ($49.5 million)[129] and 2013's Pacific Rim ($45 million).[130][131][needs update?]\n\nIt topped the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) in its third weekend.[128] Just 31 days after its release, the film became the 13th-most-successful film and 3rd-most-successful foreign film in South Korea with 9.1 million admissions trailing only Avatar (13.3 million admissions), and 2013's Frozen (10.3 million admissions).[132] The film closed down its theatrical run in China on December 12, with total revenue of $122.6 million.[133][134] In total earnings, its largest markets outside North America and China were South Korea ($73.4 million), the UK, Ireland and Malta ($31.3 million), and Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ($19 million).[135] Interstellar and Big Hero 6 opened the same weekend (November 7–9, 2014) in the US and Canada. Both were forecast to earn between $55 million and $60 million.[136] In North America, the film is the seventh-highest-grossing film to not hit No. 1, with a top rank of No. 2 on its opening weekend.[137] Interstellar had an early limited release in the US and Canada in selected theaters on November 4 at 8:00 pm, coinciding with the 2014 US midterm elections.[138] It topped the box office the following day, earning $1.35 million from 249 theaters (42 of which were IMAX screens); IMAX accounted for 62% of its total gross.[139] Two hundred and forty of those theaters played in 35 mm, 70 mm, and IMAX 70 mm film formats.[140] It earned $3.6 million from late-night shows for a previews total of $4.9 million.[141][142][143] The film was widely released on November 7 and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $17 million ahead of Big Hero 6 ($15.8 million).[144] On its opening weekend, the film earned $47.5 million[b] from 3,561 theaters, debuting in second place after a neck-and-neck competition with Disney's Big Hero 6 ($56.2 million).[146] IMAX comprised $13.2 million (28%) of its opening weekend gross,[146] while other premium large-format screens comprised $5.3 million (10.5%) of the gross.[147][148] In its second weekend, the film fell to No. 3 behind Big Hero 6 and newcomer Dumb and Dumber To (2014), and dropped 39% earning $29 million for a two-weekend total of $98 million.[149][150] It earned $7.4 million from IMAX theaters from 368 screens in its second weekend.[151][152] In its third week, the film earned $15 million and remained at No. 3, below newcomer The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and Big Hero 6.[153]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 378 critic reviews are positive, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp.\"[154] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[155] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[156]\n\nScott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety, said that Interstellar is \"as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done\" and considered the film \"more personal\" than Nolan's previous films.[157] Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the \"dull\" dialogue and \"tedious patches inside the space vessel\".[158] David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for \"being so loud\" as to make some of the dialogue \"inaudible\". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film's scientific concepts.[159] Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars, calling it \"a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour\".[160] James Berardinelli called Interstellar \"an amazing achievement\" and \"simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking.\"[161] He named it the best film of 2014,[162] and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a \"real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers\".[163]\n\n\"It's been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they're living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world. That's almost something you expect from Tarkovsky or Malick, not a science fiction adventure movie.[164]\n\nOliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times reported that \"film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times.\"[165] James Dyer of Empire awarded the film a full five stars, describing it as \"brainy, barmy, and beautiful to behold ... a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science.\"[166] Dave Calhoun of Time Out London also granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is \"a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike\".[167] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and wrote, \"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen—in terms of its visuals, and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can't measure in scientific terms. Love.\"[168]\n\nDescribing Nolan as a \"merchant of awe\", Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was \"agonisingly\" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and \"deep-digging intelligence\" of the film.[169] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.\"[170] In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its \"big-screen grandeur\", while finding some of the dialogue \"clunky\". He described it further as \"an absurd endeavor\" and \"one of the most sublime movies of the decade\".[171] Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film \"has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing\", and \"thin characters\" despite seeing the film twice in order to \"give it a second chance\". He wrote that Interstellar \"ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of 'go into space to save the world' movies.\"[172] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan's excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, \"[Interstellar] is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away ... At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.\"[173]\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among \"science and faith and science and the humanities\" and \"illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms\".[174] Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father-daughter relationship.[175] Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan's films are \"rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,\" and that \"although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see\".[176] Author George R. R. Martin called Interstellar \"the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick's 2001.\"[177] In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.[178]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, Interstellar received nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and won Best Visual Effects.[179]\n\n## See also\n\n- Black holes in fiction\n- Blanet – planet orbiting a black hole\n- Causal loop\n- Interstellar travel\n- List of American films of 2014\n- List of British films of 2014\n- List of films featuring drones\n- List of films featuring space stations\n- List of time travel works of fiction\n- Starship\n- Wormholes in fiction\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Referred to only as \"Cooper\" or \"Coop\" in the film\n- ^ In total the film earned $2.2 million from the two late-night showings which would bring its opening weekend gross to $49.7 million.[145]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Interstellar\".

The film was co-produced and directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Cline and Zak Penn, and stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. The film is set in 2045, where much of humanity uses the OASIS, a virtual reality simulation, to escape the real world. A teenage orphan finds clues to a contest that promises ownership of the OASIS to the winner, and he and his allies try to complete it before an evil corporation can do so.\n\nDevelopment of the film first began in 2010 when Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the book. In July 2015, Spielberg signed on to direct and produce the film, with casting commencing in September 2015. Filming began in England in June 2016 and was completed in September that year. The visual effects were handled by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Digital Domain and Territory Studio, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor, Inc.. As with the novel, many popular culture references appear throughout the film, including those to the Back to the Future franchise, The Iron Giant, The Shining and the Godzilla franchise.\n\nReady Player One premiered at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 29, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Spielberg's direction, the visual effects, brisk pacing, and the performances of both Sheridan and Rylance.[9][10] It was also a commercial success, grossing around $607 million worldwide against a $155–175 million budget, and earned a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and 72nd British Academy Film Awards. Ready Player One was awarded the title of Best Science Fiction Film at the 45th Saturn Awards, and a further two Outstanding Achievement Awards from the Visual Effects Society. A sequel is in development.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2045, people seek to escape from reality through the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), a virtual reality entertainment universe created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a contest, granting ownership of the OASIS to the first to find the golden Easter egg within it, which is, however, locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges. The contest has lured several \"Gunters\", or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control the OASIS himself by inserting intrusive online advertising. IOI uses an army of indentured servants and employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.\n\nTeenage orphan Wade Watts' avatar Parzival, an avid Gunter, participates in the first challenge, an unbeatable race, along with his best friend Aech, and Art3mis, a female avatar on whom Parzival has a crush. Parzival regularly visits Halliday's Journals, a simulated archive of Halliday's life and hobbies run by the Curator. Wade receives the Copper Key from Anorak after he wins by driving backward, while Art3mis, Aech, and his friends Daito and Sho, all win the race afterward, later being collectively named the High Five on the OASIS' scoreboard.\n\nSorrento asks mercenary i-R0k to learn Wade's true identity, intending to bribe him to win the contest on IOI's behalf. Wade and Art3mis discover from the Journals that Halliday once dated Morrow's wife Karen \"Kira\" Underwood. Wade and Art3mis visit the Distracted Globe night club to look for clues, where Wade confesses his love and true name to Art3mis. They survive an IOI raid in which Art3mis abandons Wade, explaining that her father died in debt to IOI. i-R0k, who was eavesdropping on their conversation, informs Sorrento of his findings. Sorrento contacts Wade with his offer. When rejected, Sorrento bombs Wade's home, killing his aunt Alice and her boyfriend Rick among others.\n\nArt3mis' player Samantha Cook takes Wade in. Together, they realize the second challenge relates to Halliday's regret of not pursuing a relationship with Kira. Along with Aech, Daito, and Sho, Parzival and Art3mis search for the recreation of the Overlook Hotel. Art3mis asks Kira to dance and wins the Jade Key. Sorrento's subordinate F'Nale Zandor storms the Gunters' hideout and captures Samantha to pay off her father's debt. Wade escapes with the help of the other High-5 users, Helen Harris (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho) in Helen's truck. Samantha escapes confinement after Aech and Parzival hack Sorrento's OASIS rig with Aech recording his confession of the bombing.\n\nThe third challenge is found in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom, where players must guess Halliday's favorite Atari 2600 game to earn the Crystal Key. i-R0k places a forcefield around the castle using the Orb of Osuvox, but Art3mis soon disables it. The High Five lead an army of OASIS players against IOI's forces. Parzival kills Samantha's avatar, allowing her to flee IOI with the High Five picking her up nearby. Parzival and Sorrento fight in the OASIS with Sorrento detonating the Cataclyst bomb, wiping out every avatar on Planet Doom, including himself.\n\nParzival respawns using an extra life coin given to him earlier by the Curator in a bet. He plays Adventure, winning the Crystal Key by locating Warren Robinett's Easter egg. He uses the three keys to enter a treasure room where Anorak offers him a contract to sign. However, he refuses to sign it, recognizing it as the one Morrow signed when Halliday forced him out of Gregarious. Anorak transforms into Halliday who expresses his regrets in life and awards Parzival the Easter egg.\n\nSorrento and F'Nale are arrested for the bombing as Morrow appears, revealing himself as the Curator. Wade decides to run the OASIS with the High Five, inviting Morrow to join them as a consultant. As the IOI Loyalty Centers are shut down, the High Five make the controversial choice to close the OASIS every Tuesday and Thursday for people to spend more time in the real world, including Wade and Samantha, who start a relationship and move into an apartment.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Tye Sheridan as Wade Watts / Parzival,[11] a Gunter who wishes to win the egg hunt so he can leave the stacks.\n- Olivia Cooke as Samantha Cook / Art3mis,[12] a well-known Gunter who works with various allies to ensure the OASIS is kept free and out of the hands of IOI, both inside the game and in real life.

From third of left: Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, T.J. Miller, and Ben Mendelsohn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWarner Bros. bought the film rights for producers Dan Farah and Donald De Line in June 2010, one year before the book was published.[27] Ernest Cline was set to write the script for the film, which De Line and Farah would produce.[28] Eric Eason rewrote Cline's script,[29] and Zak Penn was hired to rewrite the previous drafts by Cline and Eason (who became uncredited for the final draft), along with Village Roadshow Pictures coming aboard.[30] Warner Bros. attempted to convince Christopher Nolan to direct the film as his next project after Interstellar (2014), but he declined.[31] Afterwards the studio made a shortlist of potential directors including Robert Zemeckis, Edgar Wright, Matthew Vaughn, and Peter Jackson.[32][33] A directorial offer was also sent to Josh Trank, who turned it down twice.[34] Steven Spielberg finally signed on to direct and produce the film, which Kristie Macosko Krieger also produced, along with De Line and Farah.[35] Cline and Penn made several revisions while adapting the novel to film. Most of these changes were to eliminate scenes that would be uninteresting in a visual format, such as when Wade beats a high score in Pac-Man, or recites all the lines from the film WarGames.[36][37] In 2016, American musician Moby said he had tried to make the book into a movie, but discovered that Spielberg had taken the role before him.[38]\n\nElle Fanning, Olivia Cooke, and Lola Kirke were the frontrunners for the role of Art3mis;[39] with Cooke announced as having been cast in the role by September 2015.[12] In January 2016, Ben Mendelsohn joined the cast.[13] In February 2016, Tye Sheridan was confirmed to play Wade, after a lengthy casting search for the role.[40] Barry Keoghan screen-tested for the part.[41] Simon Pegg was added to the cast in March,[16] with Mark Rylance joining in April.[17] By June, T.J. Miller, Hannah John-Kamen, and Win Morisaki had also been cast in the film.[15][19][20] In July, Philip Zhao joined the cast,[18] with Lena Waithe, Ralph Ineson, Mckenna Grace, and Letitia Wright being revealed as appearing in the film over time prior to the film's release.[14][22][24][25]\n\nIn October 2019, Doctor Sleep director Mike Flanagan revealed that Jack Nicholson, who portrayed Jack Torrance in The Shining, was approached to appear in the film, but declined the offer due to his retirement.[42]\n\n### Filming\n\nProduction was slated to begin in July 2016,[43] but on July 1, 2016, screenwriter Zak Penn confirmed that the first week of filming had already been completed, meaning that filming began on June 24, 2016.[44] In August and September 2016, filming took place in Birmingham, England, standing in for Columbus, Ohio.[45] Birmingham filming included on Livery Street in the Jewellery Quarter area of the city, which was used for multiple scenes in the film. Ludgate Hill Car Park on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built, was also used, and a planned explosion there caused some local businesses and residents to call emergency services as no prior notice was given by the production team. Other locations in the city included the former industrial area of Digbeth, and some of the city's landmarks were erased and replaced with CGI buildings to create a dystopian future Ohio.[46][47] Outside of Birmingham, filming also took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and at Solaris House, the former Sun Microsystems headquarters in Surrey.[45][48] Principal photography wrapped on September 27, 2016.[49][50]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nIndustrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Digital Domain, and Territory Studio developed the visual effects, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor.[51][52] For three hours three days a week, Spielberg met with ILM, which was in charge of the OASIS segments and produced the bulk of the visual effects shots, with 900 in total; Spielberg remarked that \"this is the most difficult movie I've done since Saving Private Ryan\", as three 3-hour long meetings a week were necessitated to discuss the visual effects.[50] Visual effects supervisor Roger Guyett stated that the VFX team would collaborate with Spielberg and writers Cline and Penn:[53]\n\nWhat we did at one point was to have a card for every single character that we considered to be a \"hero\" character within the movie, and we put them up on a board and Steven and everyone else spent hours assigning them to scenes. We'd say, \"This is where we want whoever it would be … Batman, Chun-Li, or whoever.\" And then we went through the whole movie doing that. As the scenes developed, we got an understanding of how many characters we needed.\n\nPart of the film takes place in a virtual space based on the Overlook hotel in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining. It was mostly a digital recreation using high-quality telecine of the original film, allowing new camera angles and shots that did not appear in the original. Some original footage from The Shining was also used, with ILM's modifications. Only a few scenes involved real actors (such as the appearance of the Grady twins) and required reproduction of The Shining's physical sets. The Shining sequence was post-processed with film grain and other aging effects to make the new footage closely resemble the original.[54] The VFX team built the Overlook Hotel sequence in the digital realm, consulting Kubrick's blueprints.[55]\n\nILM also produced digital versions of Ready Player One's many cultural references, including the DeLorean time machine from the Back to the Future films; the Iron Giant; Chucky; and King Kong, modeled after the 1933 film version.[56] The Tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park was created from the base model ILM had created.[56] Digital Domain facilitated pre-visualization (with The Third Floor), motion capture, and virtual sets, and also created 300 visual effects shots for the primarily live-action portions of the film. The virtual sets were powered by game engines and were used congruently with the motion-capture process, with previsualization supervisor Scott Meadows explaining that in real time Spielberg would \"put on a headset and scout the sets and make adjustments.\"[51][52]\n\n## Music\n\nOn June 9, 2016, John Williams was initially going to compose the film's score.[57] However, in July 2017, Williams left the project in favor of scoring Spielberg's The Post, and Alan Silvestri took over scoring duties.[58] The score was released by WaterTower Music as a two-CD set on March 30, 2018,[59] with vinyl and cassette releases projected.[60] At Spielberg's request, Silvestri references his own music from Back to the Future within the film's score, as well as quoting music by other composers, including Max Steiner's theme from King Kong, Akira Ifukube’s main theme from Godzilla, and the score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind from The Shining.[61][62]\n\n## Cultural references\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg was reluctant to include references to his own movies for the film, but would eventually include references to the Back to the Future and Jurassic Park franchises.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReady Player One pays homage to popular culture from various time periods, mainly the 1970s and 1980s but also extending to the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s; reviewers have identified over a hundred references to films, television shows, music, toys, video games, anime, and comics from these eras.[63][64][65] Cline did not have any issues with these copyrighted elements when he published the book, but was aware that securing all necessary rights would be a major obstacle for a film adaptation. This task was eventually made easier thanks to Spielberg's reputation in the film industry.[36][66][67] In the end, Spielberg estimated that they managed to get about 80% of the copyrighted elements they desired.[36] Somewhat ironically, the production was unable to secure the rights to Spielberg's own Close Encounters of the Third Kind from Columbia Pictures.[68]\n\nThe Dungeons &amp; Dragons module Tomb of Horrors features in an important episode of the book, the \"Copper Key challenge\", but that reference was excluded from the film, where the challenge features a huge car race in New York instead. However, the film does reference the module: artwork of the Tomb of Horrors demon appears on the back of Aech's van.[69]\n\nSimilarly Blade Runner, which was integral to the plot of the book, was shelved as Blade Runner 2049 was in production at the same time as Ready Player One and the producers at Alcon Entertainment feared that Spielberg's film could damage the commercial prospects of their film; as a replacement, the creative team had the players play through the events of The Shining, to which Spielberg was able to secure the rights, as an homage to his friend Stanley Kubrick.[36] Penn and Cline also thought that the film could be the opportunity to replace such a lengthy sequence with a more action-heavy one. Once they decided to use The Shining, they were doubtful at first that Spielberg would accept the change, but Spielberg did go for it.[70] While Cline's original work heavily used the character of Ultraman, the rights over the character were still under legal dispute, requiring them to replace him with the titular robot from The Iron Giant and the RX-78-2 Gundam.[71] Spielberg recognized that his past films were a significant part of the 1980s popular culture cited in the book, and to avoid being accused of \"vanity\", he opted to remove many of the references to his own work.[72] Cline stated that he believed Spielberg wanted to avoid self-references to films he directed, due to the criticism he received for his film 1941, which lampooned his own previous works Jaws and Duel. Cline said he had to convince Spielberg to include some iconic elements, such as the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, which Spielberg conceded as the film was one he produced rather than directed.[73] Spielberg also allowed the Tyrannosaurus rex from his own Jurassic Park to be included.[56] Cline also asked ILM to include a reference to Last Action Hero, one of Penn's first screenplays, without Penn's knowledge; a movie marquee in the Manhattan race segment bears the name \"Jack Slater\", the character Arnold Schwarzenegger played in that film.[74]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nReady Player One was originally scheduled to be released on December 15, 2017.[75] However, on February 9, 2016, it was delayed to March 30, 2018, to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[76] In January 2018, it was announced the film's release date had been moved up one day to March 29.[77] The film had its world premiere at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018 (as part of the South by Southwest Film Festival).[5] Warner Bros. distributed the film worldwide, with Village Roadshow Pictures distributing in several overseas territories.[78] Around the same time, the massively multi-player online game platform Roblox held an event based on it. The winner of the event was the user r0cu.[79]\n\n### Home media\n\nReady Player One was released on digital copy on July 3, 2018, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 24, 2018.[80] The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart, a tracker of combined domestic Blu-Ray and DVD unit sales, for the week ending on July 27, 2018.[81] It retained the No. 1 spot on the chart for the week ending on August 4, 2018.[82]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nReady Player One grossed $137.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $469.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $607 million.[8] Deadline Hollywood had estimated it would need to gross at least $440 million to break even, given its $175 million budget.[83]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Ready Player One was projected to gross $40–50 million from 4,100 theaters over its first four days.[7] It made $12.1 million on its first day, including $3.75 million from Wednesday night previews. It ended up grossing $41.8 million in its opening weekend (for a four-day total of $53.7 million).[84] It made $24.6 million in its second weekend, finishing second behind newcomer A Quiet Place, and $11.5 million in its third weekend, finishing in fourth.[85][86]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% with an average score of 6.8/10, based on 443 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Ready Player One is a sweetly nostalgic thrill ride that neatly encapsulates Spielberg's strengths while adding another solidly engrossing adventure to his filmography.\"[87] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 82% overall positive score and a 65% \"definite recommend\".[83]\n\nIn a review for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico wrote that the film's \"overwhelming\" nature and non-stop action will likely thrill fans of pop culture; while he observed narrative weaknesses, such as a lack of depth among the supporting characters, he felt that they ultimately do not hinder the film from working \"on the level of technical, blockbuster mastery that Spielberg helped define\".[89] Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman called the film a \"coruscating explosion of pop-culture eye candy\" and found the sequence based on The Shining to be \"irresistible\". However, he criticized Spielberg's separation of fantasy and reality, and he said the film has \"more activity than it does layers\".[90] IndieWire's Eric Kohn characterized the film as \"an astonishing sci-fi spectacle and a relentless nostalgia trip at once\" and praised both the sequence based on The Shining and Penn's screenplay, particularly with respect to Mendelsohn's character. Nevertheless, he remarked that the film \"drags a bunch in its final third\".[91] Alissa Wilkinson, writing for Vox, praised both the quality and quantity of the worldbuilding. She also commented on just how dystopian the future portrayed is, where the main characters fight to save the OASIS and the escape from reality it represents, with arguably less concern for the problems of the real world.[92] Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Ready Player One and noted the undercurrent of sadness present in the film, stating that \"I don't think Spielberg gets enough credit for making sad films that most people interpret as happy, and complex films that are immediately dismissed as simple or confused\".[93][94][95] Seitz concluded that the film \"is a mess, but it is a fascinating and complex one...\"[96] In March 2019, a year after the film's release, Seitz determined that with Ready Player One's images commenting on capitalism and popular culture, the film was the second-most \"interesting [and] substantive\" big-budgeted fantasy in 2018 after Black Panther, admitting that \"I still think about [Ready Player One] a lot, especially concerning the world around me.\"[97][98]\n\nMonica Castillo was more critical of the film in her review for The Guardian and drew attention to the absence of character arcs, the lack of resolution for plot holes in the novel, and the bloating of scenes in the film by trivia.[99] Alonso Duralde, writing for TheWrap, found the usage of pop culture references lacking, and found his experience watching the film as \"feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past. I've never been much of a video-game player, but by the finale, I was ready to 'Leeroy Jenkins!' my way out of the theater\".[100]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                         | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                  | Recipient(s)                                                                               | Result    | Ref(s)    |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Sci-Fi Movie                                       | Ready Player One                                                                           | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor                                 | Tye Sheridan                                                                               | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actress                               | Olivia Cooke                                                                               | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Breakout Movie Star                                | Olivia Cooke                                                                               | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards  | January 13, 2019    | Best Visual Effects                                       | Ready Player One                                                                           | Nominated | [102]     |\n| Visual Effects Society Awards | February 5, 2019    | Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature         | Roger Guyett, Jennifer Meislohn, Dave Shirk, Matthew E.

I don't know if Steven [Spielberg] would want to dive back in, because he would know what he is getting into. He's said that it's the third-hardest film he's made, out of dozens and dozens of movies\".[111][112][113] Cline wrote a book sequel, titled Ready Player Two, which was released on November 24, 2020, stating in the acknowledgments that he had consulted Spielberg on the final draft of the book and where to take a potential film adaptation.[114][115]\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Cline announced that a sequel was in the early stages of development.[116] Spielberg confirmed that the film was still in development as of March 2024, stating that he would not direct the film unlike its predecessor, but produce it.[117]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f \"Film Releases\".

An international co-production, the film marks Bong's English-language debut; almost 85% of the film's dialogue is in English.[13][14]\n\nThe film stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Go Ah-sung, John Hurt, and Ed Harris. It takes place aboard the Snowpiercer train as it travels a globe-encircling track, carrying the last remnants of humanity after a failed attempt at climate engineering to stop global warming has created a new Snowball Earth. Evans stars as Curtis Everett, leader of the lower-class tail-section passengers, as they rebel against the elite of the front of the train. Filming took place at Barrandov Studios in Prague, using train car sets mounted on gimbals to simulate the train's motion.\n\nSnowpiercer received critical acclaim and appeared on many film critics' top ten lists of 2014 after its international release, with praise for its vision, direction, and performances, particularly by Evans and Swinton. In the United States, the film was initially planned for a limited-screen showing but the critical response prompted The Weinstein Company to expand the showing to more theaters and to digital streaming services. With a budget of $40 million, it remains one of the most expensive South Korean productions ever.[15][16] The fourth volume of the original Snowpiercer graphic novel series, Snowpiercer: Terminus, published 2019, serves as a sequel of the film, establishing it as being set in the same continuity as the original graphic novels.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2014, an attempt to stop climate change via stratospheric aerosol injection catastrophically backfires, creating a new ice age that destroys much of life on Earth. For 17 years, the remnants of humanity shelter in a state-of-the-art self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\n\nUrged by his mentor Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist. For his assistance, they bribe him with Kronole, an addictive drug made from industrial waste. Namgoong also insists that his clairvoyant daughter, Yona, be freed. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress, but they face guards armed with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis sacrifices him to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender while Edgar is killed. The tail mob stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who had their children taken from them) towards the front of the train.\n\nCurtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and speculate that the ice may be thawing more and more with every year. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to celebrate the train's eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. Then the bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with automatic firearms hidden under the eggs. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, which prompts Curtis to execute Mason in turn. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is then seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong.\n\nIn the last compartment before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can now survive outside. Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, the tail section resorted to cannibalism. Edgar was an infant when Curtis killed his mother, and Curtis was going to eat him when Gilliam offered his severed arm instead, stopping the bloodshed. Curtis wants to confront Wilford for causing such horrors. Wilford's assistant, Claude, emerges from behind the engine room door to invite Curtis inside.\n\nCurtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. After ordering the execution of most of the tail section residents, Wilford offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept as Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and asks for a match. In desperation, she pulls open a floorboard to reveal Tanya's son, Timmy, working the engine as a replacement for a broken machine part, taken from his mother to be a slave. Appalled, Curtis beats up Wilford and rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the process. Andy, Andrew's missing son, crawls out of a nook and climbs into the engine core despite Curtis's pleas. Curtis gives Yona the match to light the fuse for the Kronole bomb, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who followed them. Damaged by the fighting, the door to the engine room cannot be closed, forcing Curtis and Namgoong to use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast.\n\nThe explosion triggers an avalanche that derails and wrecks the train. Curtis and Namgoong are unresponsive, so Yona and Timmy escape the wreckage. They see a polar bear in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train and did not die out as they were first led to believe.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Chris Evans as Curtis Everett \n The leader of the revolution.[17][18][19] About the character of Curtis, Evans said, \"I mean, for me, the tail section is, I think that's Curtis. I think that's who he is. The tail section is hard; it's grinding; it's tough; it's real. So that's where I had the most fun. Back there.\"[20] Casting directors suggested Evans to Bong, who initially had misconceptions of Evans before they met due to the \"caricature of the American all muscle\", but quickly departed from that notion and described Evans as \"actually very sensitive and has a quiet and introverted side. He's a very, very smart person, and he's a director.\"[21] Bong was introduced to the films Puncture and Sunshine where he described Evans's performances as showing his \"sensitive acting abilities\". Bong and Evans spent months talking about the dialogue, and Bong received help from the cast and crew including Evans due to it being his first English language film.[22] Bong said that for the role of Curtis, hiding Evans's muscular physique was the most difficult thing about working with the actor, explaining, \"He's supposed to be in the poor tail section for 17 years, eating only protein blocks, and it was tricky to hide all of that muscle mass with costume and make-up.\"[23] On whether he was surprised by the fan response, Evans said, \"I've been surprised about everything about this movie. Every movie you make, you hope people will enjoy it, but this movie has surpassed all of my expectations across the board.\"[24][25]\n- Song Kang-ho as Namgoong Minsoo \n The specialist who designed the security features on the train.[17][18][19] On taking the role, Song said, \"This was the third time I worked with director Bong, and working with director Bong is a wonderful experience.... [T]his time around, working with the wonderful cast members was a tremendous experience.\"[26][27] Describing Namgoong, Bong said, \"He sets up the ending, because he has a vision about this world that's different from Curtis's. He has a desire to go outside of the train.\"[28] On the name of the character, Bong stated, \"I was looking for a name that would be most difficult for foreigners to pronounce. Namgoong ... it is difficult. There are some name-related jokes in the film.\"[29] Song plays a character who only speaks Korean, and although as difficult as it was, he said, \"at the same time, it was very refreshing and fun to do\".[26]\n- Ed Harris as Wilford \n The creator and caretaker of the engine.[17][18] Dustin Hoffman was considered for the role.[30] About the character, Harris said, \"He's so built up, who this guy is, and then there's this big thing open, and he's just this old guy making dinner with his robe on, but director Bong really wanted him to be matter-of-fact and very mundane, and simple, and kind of freaky that way.\"[31] Harris also added that the character is \"probably a coagulation of various folks\".[31] The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role.[32] Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with \"tremendous presence and performance from the first moment that he appeared in order to convince the audience\", adding that \"[Harris] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal.\"[19] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, \"When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, but I had never seen any of them ... I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work with the guy. I'm a big fan of his.\"[33] Harris praised Bong very highly, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting.[33] Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, \"He slept with Claude, the Egghead, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his 'the One' is the Engine.\"[34] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.[35]\n- John Hurt as Gilliam \n The spiritual leader of the tail section.[17][18] Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one with the ability to \"exude the ambience of spirituality\".[19] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, \"He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is,\" adding, \"as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people.\"[36] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because \"the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches... and having to make it look like as though I'd been doing it for years.\"[37] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to \"interpret things as we want, as we see fit\" as well as adding pointers to the act.[36] Hurt said of Bong, \"I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when I got home. I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since.\"[38][39] as well as previously adding, \"He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something.... He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him.\"[40]\n- Tilda Swinton as Minister Mason \n Wilford's right hand, the second in command on the train and the spokesperson for Wilford for the past 17 years.[19][17][18] About the character, Swinton said, \"Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt we were dealing with extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket.\"[7] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, \"a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns\". Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler, and Silvio Berlusconi.[41][42] The Yorkshire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, \"was an early example of authority\".[7] Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as \"peaceful\", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, \"I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason.\"[43][44] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, \"Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously, there was something that started the whole look.\" Additionally, Swinton stated, \"As we were playing, we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts... And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [Bell] wearing Mason's breasts.\"[45][46] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondřej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who \"loved it\".[47][48] The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.[49]\n- Jamie Bell as Edgar \n Curtis's second-in-command.[19][17][18] On taking the role, Bell said, \"The reason why I wanted to be a part of the film was because of what Director Bong had to say about it; it was his vision that he brought to the table and I thought what it stood for was important to me.\"[50] When asked of performances that were interpreted differently onscreen from the screenplay, writer Masterson stated, \"[Bell] is very impish and mischievous as Edgar, which I didn't predict from his character. That might just be Jamie.\"[51] and of his performance, \"I think [Bell]'s performance, a lot of it is improvised, and quite brilliantly.\"[52] On relating to the character, Bell said, \"You know, I come from a very working-class background myself. There was the sense that I had to overcome something and really test myself. So, in a way Edgar is very similar, he genuinely doesn't have anything and he's the lowest of the low of these people.\"[50]\n- Octavia Spencer as Tanya \n A determined mother who is set on getting her son back.[17][18] Despite not possessing the qualities of a fighter, she nonetheless takes part in the rebellion and speaks for the people of the tail section.[19] The film marks Spencer's first time working in the science-fiction genre. Spencer described Bong as \"an auteur\" and expressed sadness at the studio's proposal to cut the film.[53] On imagery from the history base of references, Bong said, \"When [Spencer]'s character is being beaten by the soldier, it's meant to remind people, somewhat, of the Rodney King incident.\"[28] On the message of the film, Spencer said, \"We are all covered in smoke and dirt from years and years of not washing and particles in the air, and we are all the same color if you look at it.\"[28]\n- Ewen Bremner as Andrew \n A helpless father whose only wish is to protect his son.[17][18][54] On taking the role, Bremner said, \"I watched director Bong's film Mother which I was really knocked out by. He has a much adventurous sense of a character and he's a rare director in his route to cast actors that he really likes.\"[19] Despite the weak and frail imagery of the character of Andrew, Bong needed an actor who was able to convey the raw emotion of the character to the audience directly.[19] Bong became a fan of Bremner's after watching his appearance in Naked. On Bremner, Bong said, \"He would become an actor like Byun Hee-bong one day.\"[19]\n- Go Ah-sung (credited as Ko Asung) as Namgoong Yona \n The 17-year-old daughter of Namgoong Minsoo.[17][18] On taking the role, Go said, \"It was like going back to where it all started. Director Bong gave instructions and Mr. Song gave me advice or guidance, so it felt like I had returned to being on my first film, The Host.\"[19] About her character's name, Go said, \"[Bong] couldn't think of any name for Yona; he just left her as \"The Inuit Girl\".[26] I gave him Nastyona's album, and he went \"This is it!\" adding, \"It also matches the Biblical figure Jonah [pronounced Yona in some languages, including Korean] and had a right feel to it.\" She added that she spoke with a mixed accent of the United States, Philippines and India, and spoke to fellow cast member Ewen Bremner for advice on her English pronunciation.[55] Go described Yona as being, \"someone who was completely indifferent to Minsoo's ambition. Even if she knew, she wouldn't have cared.\"[56] Of Yona's background, Bong revealed, \"Yona's mother was the leader of the Frozen Seven's revolution—because she was an Inuit. She was confident that she could endure the coldness. However, she went out too early.\"[57]\n- Alison Pill as Teacher \n Found teaching a classroom of young students, towards the front of the Snowpiercer.[58][59]\n- Vlad Ivanov as Franco the Elder \n A seemingly indestructible henchman working for Minister Mason.[60][61]\n- Luke Pasqualino as Grey \n Gilliam's bodyguard, a muscular, agile, fast-moving warrior who is handy with knives.[62][63] On taking the role of Grey, Pasqualino said, \"I got to work with a dream cast and [Bong] who I think is frankly a genius. I feel very lucky and privileged to be given the opportunity\".[64] Grey has various tattoos on his body, each seeming having a specific story, including Gilliam's name tattooed on the heart side of his chest.[63][65] After the film's release Bong revealed background information, \"There are homosexual relationships among the men. Gilliam and Grey seem like a couple with a large age gap. Gilliam is someone whom Grey admires deeply, of course, but one could imagine they sleep together too. And Gilliam sends Grey to Curtis.\"[34]\n\nAdditionally, Adnan Hasković as Franco the Younger, an executor of the army led by Mason;[66][67] Clark Middleton as the Painter, who is often seen drawing other passengers or key events visually chronicling underclass life and death;[68] Emma Levie as Claude, Wilford's assistant who may have a relationship with Wilford;[69][70][71][72][73] Tómas Lemarquis as Egg-head, one of Wilford's agents that aids in the New Year celebration massacre;[74][75] Steve Park as Fuyu, a regimented assistant to Mason;[76][77] and Paul Lazar as Paul, one of the rebels in Curtis's army who makes the protein blocks.[78][79] The creators of the graphic novel, Jean-Marc Rochette and Benjamin Legrand, have cameo appearances in the film.[80][81][82]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nWhen I first came across Transperceneige, the first thing that grabbed my attention was the unique cinematic space of a train. Hundreds of metal pieces moving like a snake carrying people squirming inside gripped my heart. And the people were fighting against each other. They were not equal in this Noah's ark that held the last survivors as they were divided into cars.\n\nIn the winter of 2005, Bong found Jean-Marc Rochette's French graphic novel series Le Transperceneige at a comic book shop near Hongik University and finished reading the entire series while standing in front of the bookshelf where he found it.[84][85] He was fascinated by ideas of people struggling on the train for survival, and how every section is classified in social stratification. Bong showed the series to his friends, fellow director Park Chan-wook and producer Lee Tae-hun, who loved it as well.[86] Although Bong praised the original graphic novel, he soon realized that a film like Snowpiercer needed an original take. Bong stated, \"... I had to come up with a completely new story and new characters in order to create a new, dynamic Snowpiercer that was packed with cinematic exhilaration.\"[87]\n\nIn the following year, Park's production company Moho Film acquired the copyrights to the original story of Snowpiercer for Bong, and in 2007 the copyrights to the story extended. The first draft of the screenplay for Snowpiercer was completed on 15 September 2010, and in December, the second draft of screenplay was completed and modified.[88] On 4 October 2010, Bong, whilst at the Vancouver International Film Festival, had initially entertained the idea of shooting the film in Canada due to it having \"... a great infrastructure for filmmaking, and Korean expatriates are involved in the film industry a lot.\"[88] Bong wanted a film studio with a 75- to 100-meter-long space to fill with four train cars connected together. The production team travelled to Europe for studio scouting and ended up with two studio choices: Barrandov Studios in Czech Republic and Korda Studios in Hungary. In August 2011, a Czech producer hired by the production team began negotiations with two film studios for availability; Barrandov Studios was eventually chosen as the film studio and production service provider of Snowpiercer.[89][90]\n\nOn 18 January 2012, Kelly Masterson was hired to rewrite the script before it went into production due to Bong seeing his screenplay work on Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and being impressed with the tonality of darkness and acuity in the story.[91][92] Bong and Masterson had originally envisioned a romantic story for the protagonist; however they jettisoned that idea in subsequent drafts of the screenplay.[93] On 8 October 2013, at the Busan International Film Festival, Bong acknowledged the challenges in adapting such a story to fit the apparent constraints of cinema, to which had to omit certain scenes from the graphic novel, \"... I had to capture that long story in a two-hour film, so rather than cut out some scenes from the comic, I just rewrote the whole story to fit this time frame.\"[94][95]\n\nOn 13 January 2012, Chris Evans began negotiations to star in the film adaptation, and was later confirmed as the film's male lead.[96] On 17 January 2012, Tilda Swinton and Jamie Bell were confirmed to be in talks to join the project.[97] Swinton first met Bong at the Cannes Film Festival, where she was of the mind that she did not want to make any other films, a decision she takes after each film: \"And that one (and only) condition in which I will make another film is that I will have some fun.[98] So we started to play with the idea of what would amuse us about this.\" Bong and Swinton experimented with voices, mannerisms and the general appearance of the character of Mason.[99] On 18 January 2012, John Hurt was confirmed to have been cast, with Hurt stating, \"All the film crew refer to [Bong], with great reverence, as 'Director Bong'. I love the fact that I am working for Director Bong.\"[100] On 2 February 2012, Octavia Spencer had joined the cast of Bong's project in the role of a \"passenger on the train who joins the revolt in order to save her son.\"[101] Ed Harris spoke of his love of Bong Joon-ho's films and wanted to work with him, \"I want to do this. I don't care what he's asking me to do because he's a really great filmmaker.\"[102] On 27 February 2012, Ewen Bremner had joined the cast of Bong's film.[103][104][105] On 3 April 2012, Luke Pasqualino was confirmed to have joined the cast.[106][107]\n\nBong states that it took four years to develop the project, with an additional three to produce with Park.[22] Stating, \"Today, I feel I have overcome a terrible disease, like cancer cells had occupied my body during that time,\" as well as expressing an interest in making smaller films in the future.[108] The film's production countries include the Czech Republic, France, South Korea, and the United States.\n\n### Filming\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho promoting the film at the 2013 Deauville American Film Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn August 2011, the studio was determined as the shooting location, and in October 2011, Bong and his production team moved to the Czech Republic.[109][110][111] During the period of November 2011 to April 2012, the key members of the crew were secured and confirmed, those being: Ondřej Nekvasil, Eric Durst, Julian Spencer and Marco Beltrami. The preparatory production began in Tyrol, Austria during mid-March for one day to shoot some snowy scenery on the Hintertux Glacier, which made for excellent conditions and perfect weather.[112][113] On 3 April 2012, principal photography had officially begun in Prague, Czech Republic, at the Barrandov Studios on gimbals on its interconnected sound-stages after preparatory filming in the production occurred at the end of March, with a said budget near to $42 million, which was the largest film budget of all time for any film with Korean investors.[114]\n\nBong filmed Snowpiercer with 35mm film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.[115][116] Roughly ninety percent of the film was shot on set. Bong's original wish was to shoot the film entirely in Korea, but a studio large enough to accommodate a set of such scale was difficult to find, thus Barrandov Studio was used instead, requiring the construction of a 100-meter replica of the title train.[114][117] In choosing Barrandov Studio, Bong explained, \"All the artwork, huge train sets and the gimbal were greatly completed and fully operational. Shooting at Barrandov Studios will never stop with a perpetual engine.\"[118] Bong's usage of the studio allowed him and his team to carry out meticulous experiments to contrive perpetual movement by staging the film on a giant gyroscopic gimbal, which can roll from side to side or bend realistically, to give three-dimensional feel to the train.[119] Nearly all the shots within the train are filmed so that the tail sections are left of the characters on-screen, and the engine to the right; this was a \"discipline\" that Bong wanted to \"maintain that energy, and give the audience a sense that whichever way the shot is moving, that's where the characters are going\".[120]\n\nFlash SFX, the team involved in the construction of the gimbal stated, \"The main challenge of physical effects work was that of inventing and developing a system that would perfectly simulate movements of train in motion. We managed to create a massive gimbal system supporting train cars with a total weight close to 100 tons. It was capable of simulating all sideway motions and vibrations of the train, including perfect make-believe curves of railroad tracks.\"[121]\n\nOn 14 July 2012, principal photography officially wrapped in the Barrandov Studios after a 72-day shoot,[122][123] with post-production carried out in South Korea, and Bong started editing the film for its release.[123]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects company Scanline VFX worked on Snowpiercer.[124] The company worked primarily on the exterior shots of the film: the frozen city, the Yekaterina Bridge, the Frozen Harbour landscape in the sushi lounge, the \"Frozen Seven\" sequence, the industrial park in the shoot-out sequence, and the avalanche and post crash environment at the end of the film.[125] Already having multiple designs, storyboards and basic concepts of the train cars, it set in motion the development of over 60 different versions of the various wagons for the train Snowpiercer. Thus, visual effects supervisor Michel Mielke said \"... we [had] a good idea of the vision of director Bong, we saw what he liked, and what did not work for the movie.\"[125]\n\nVisual effects designer Eric Durst spoke of the Aquarium Car being an intriguing challenge of lighting, with the differentiation of a water-based environment on one side and a frozen-based landscape at the other. Durst and his team, including director of photography Alex Hong, had light \"travel through water trays on top of the aquarium structure.\"[124] Durst added that \"These refracted the light spilling on the actors, replicating the way light would react in an actual aquarium environment.\" In the task of creating that world, Mark Breakspear and his team in Vancouver spent a great amount of time at the Vancouver Aquarium to study \"the fish, the lighting environments, the way the light refracted through the water and glass, along with how it distorted the fish as they passed.\"[124]\n\nAmong the most challenging effects on the train was the length of the train and the number of cars that needed to be handled. Mielke had a \"very complex rig\" created and built to provide the animators involved in the creating process with enough capability as was possible. He stated, \"The rig managed that the train automatically followed the rails, that the motion of the wagons where simulated depending on the rails, that the wagons could be changed easily and so on.\"[125]\n\nParallel to principal photography in Prague, the first designs of visuals spanned from May 2012 up until the final shots of early March 2013, with a team of over 70 artists developing over 186 VFX-shots with almost 50 being full of computer-generated imagery.[125]\n\n### Design\n\n#### Costume design\n\nCostume designer Catherine George explained that Mason was initially inspired by a Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondřej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst a room full of dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood.[126] In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late sixties and early seventies, adding that, \"... a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and scoff at people who were less better off, a bit of a Margaret Thatcher type, really.\"[127] George also designed Minister Mason's suit to look \"a typical conservative politician shape and style\" with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire.[127] She had \"collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals\" to experiment with the designs of such a character.[128] George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional.[128] George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with \"a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth\" and played with costuming ideas for Swinton's Minster Mason character.[126]\n\nOn creating individuality for the passengers in the tail section, George had the designs come from random materials they would use to fashion practical clothing, \"The tail section clothing was pieced together from different garments and repairs were made on top of that. They had to improvise with any materials that were left on the train.\"[127] For the design of Curtis, Bong and George wanted him to be anonymous but at the same time recognizable. The design was difficult as George had to conceal Evans's muscular physique and muscle mass thus, \"We had to cut out the sleeves of his under layers to help him look leaner.\"[129]\n\nGeorge personally designed the costumes for Nam and Yona, who wear the \"darker-coloured intense black\".[128] Taking inspiration from photographs of train engineers from an early industrial period and vintage French railway jackets, it was designed while she looked at utilitarian clothes due to Nam previously being a train engineer before his imprisonment. George also designed many of the tail section costumes, including Nam's, using Japanese Boro fabric.[127]\n\nIn creating Claude's yellow coat and dress, George was mindful of the fact it was the first colour of brightness in the tail section scene, as well as the property of yellow being the most luminous colour in the spectrum.[127] She expressed, \"It's the colour that captures our attention more than any other and in colour psychology yellow is non-emotional and lacking compassion.\" Camera testing occurred before deciding the final colours as well as observing how they'd interact, with the back drop of darker costume colours.[127]\n\n#### Production design\n\nBong and his illustrators created various pieces of concept art for the train cars of Snowpiercer, led by Czech production designer Ondřej Nekvasil, who was brought onto the production team to help realize those visions.[87][130] Nekvasil approached the atmosphere of the tail section it as if it were a \"dark, monochromatic ... life\", emphasising poor living arrangements, to which he found inspiration from poor areas of Hong Kong and elsewhere to put in the set designs. In order to make the colours appear \"used\" and \"dirty\", Nekvasil and company started with colourful props that were subsequently washed out and forcibly aged to create a feeling of \"really used property and space\", while creating a back story to justify the appearance.[130]\n\nWhen designing the train, Nekvasil and Bong hit upon the idea of the train not being designed by one man in one specific moment; the idea that \"these various train cars were built in different periods of Wilford's life\".[131][132] Another idea was the logical scale of the train itself, though Bong entertained the notion of it being beyond a logical scale, Nekvasil stated, \" ... if it's 20 feet [6 m] wide, it'll no longer seem like a train.\"[132] Dimensions and sizes were discussed, and the design sized finalised was \"slightly bigger than a typical train\", though enough to allow space for camera movement inside the train. The design was difficult due to distance limitations, as Nekvasil said, \"... the biggest stage we had, which was about 300 feet [90 m] long, was not big enough to fit everything.\"[132]\n\nInstead of overly relying on CGI, Nekvasil's production design team constructed twenty-six individual train cars and used a giant gyroscopic gimbal in Prague's Barrandov Studios to simulate the movement of an actual train when shooting.[133][134] Bong stated that the gimbal was used on the third day of shooting, explaining, \"Sometimes we felt carsick on set,\" due to the realistic effects of the gimbal.[133]\n\n#### Sound design\n\nSound engineers Anna Behlmer, Terry Porter and Mark Holding mixed the sound for Snowpiercer, supervised by sound editor Taeyoung Choi.[135]\n\n### Music and soundtrack\n\nIn May 2012, Marco Beltrami was hired to compose the incidental music for Snowpiercer.[136] In January 2013, a song titled Yona Lights was released on the film's official website in South Korea.[137] In July 2013, during the 007 Fimucité at Tenerife International Film Music Festival in the Canary Islands, a few pieces of the three films composed by Beltrami (Snowpiercer, Soul Surfer and The Wolverine) were selected for the performance.[138]\n\nThe film's official soundtrack was released in August 2013 in South Korea and the international release date was on 9 September 2013.[139]\n\n## Release\n\nSnowpiercer premiered at the Times Square on 29 July 2013 in Seoul, South Korea,[140] before screening at the Deauville American Film Festival as the closing film on 7 September 2013,[141] the Berlin International Film Festival as the part of Berlin's Forum sidebar on 7 February 2014,[142] opening the Los Angeles Film Festival on 11 June 2014,[143] and the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 22 June 2014.[144]\n\n### Cutting request\n\nOn 9 November 2012, The Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights to Snowpiercer from CJ Entertainment based on the script and some completed footage, with a plan for wide release in North America, as well as throughout the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[145] It was released in the United States on 27 June 2014 in just eight theaters in selected cities.[146] This delay was caused by Harvey Weinstein, an owner of The Weinstein Company, requesting 25 minutes of footage be cut, asking for less dialogue and more action,[147] and a voice-over sequence at the end of the film.[148] The fish-gutting scene was one that Weinstein was adamant about removing, but Bong lied to Weinstein, claiming his father was a fisherman and the scene was in tribute to his father, to get Weinstein to agree to keep it.[147] Weinstein screened his cut to a test audience of around 250 members. In response to the poor score given by the test audience, Weinstein said to Bong they needed to cut more.[147] In a later test screening of Bong's original cut of the film, the audience's score was \"much higher\".[148] Following the news of the cut, a Free Snowpiercer petition campaign demanding the director's cut of the film to be released in the US was created by cinema activist Denise Heard-Bashur,[149] with support from the film's stars Tilda Swinton and John Hurt.[147] Bong's uncut version of the film was eventually released,[150] but with the caveat that the film switched distributors to Radius-TWC, resulting in a limited release in art house cinemas.[147] On 3 July 2014, it was announced that thanks to positive reviews, Snowpiercer would get a wider US release and play in over 150 theaters.[151][152]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in various countries, including France and Korea, over Q3 and Q4 first, before the movie was finally debuted in North American theaters. The film was eventually released on home media in North America by Starz's Anchor Bay Entertainment through The Weinstein Company Home Entertainment on 21 October 2014,[153] and became available on Netflix for streaming on 1 November 2014.[citation needed] It did not get a genuine UK release until November 2018, when it was made available digitally via Amazon Prime Video and was released on DVD &amp; Blu-ray in 2020. A 4K restoration of the film is scheduled to be released on Blu-ray and digitally on January 14, 2025, by Lionsgate.[154]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nBetween its South Korean opening on 27 June 2014 and 23 October 2014, the film earned US$86.7 million worldwide.[155] As of April 2014[update], it was the tenth highest-grossing domestic film in South Korea with 9.35 million admissions. The film holds the domestic record for the fastest movie (domestic and foreign) to reach four million admissions, which it achieved in its fifth day after premiere, and another record for the highest weekend figure (from Friday to Sunday) for a Korean film, with 2.26 million viewers.[156] The film took in $171,000 on its US opening weekend, averaging around $21,400 per theater.[157] The film grossed US$59.8 million in South Korea and its largest international market was China, with $11.1 million.[158]\n\n### Critical response\n\nFilm review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 94% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 267 reviews with an average score of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Snowpiercer offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacle for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters.\"[159] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \"universal acclaim\".[160]\n\nChris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the piece an \"A\" rating, stating, \"Snowpiercer sucks you into its strange, brave new world so completely, it leaves you with the all-too-rare sensation that you've just witnessed something you've never seen before ... and need to see again.\"[161]\n\nA. O. Scott wrote, in his review for The New York Times, \"Planetary destruction and human extinction happen a half-dozen times every summer. It's rarely this refreshing, though.\"[162] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian scored the film most positively, writing, \"Snowpiercer works brilliantly, the sum of extremely disparate parts that adds up to cinematic excellence.\"[163] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York scored the film five out of five stars, writing, \"Sprung from a 1982 French graphic novel and bearing its era's trickle-down tensions, Snowpiercer is a headlong rush into conceptual lunacy—but you'll love it anyway.\" Rothkopf praises Joon-ho, stating, \"... Bong grabs onto the grungy conventions of postapocalyptic adventure with relish. He serves up claustrophobic action scenes (one largely shot in the dark) and ominous, messianic overtones as the band of rebels makes its way forward.\"[164]\n\nLou Lumenick of The New York Post gave the film high acclaim, writing, \"Don't miss it—this is enormously fun visionary filmmaking, with a witty script and a great international cast.\" He added, \"The beautifully designed train is one of the most memorable in screen history ...\"[165] David Denby of The New Yorker spoke highly of the piece, stating it to be, \"Violent, often absurd, but full of brilliant surprises, while Bong keeps the center of the action moving toward the front of the train, a considerable feat of camera placement, choreographed mayhem, and cohesive editing\", and praising Nekvasil's production design, \"Bong and [Nekvasil], provide them with a series of sybaritic astonishments.\"[166]\n\nClarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a highly positive review, commenting, \"Snowpiercer is still an intellectually and artistically superior vehicle to many of the end-of-days futuristic action thrillers out there.\" Speaking highly of Bong's film-making, Tsui wrote, \"Bong's vivid depictions—aided by Ondřej Nekvasil's production design, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography and Steve M. Choe's editing—are exceptional.\"[1] David Thomson of The New Republic remarked that \"The most bracing and liberating thing about Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer is not just its lyrical forward motion, but the exuberance with which the film revels in its plot predicament.\" He furthers praises Nekvasil's \"progression of design set-pieces\" and Tilda Swinton's performance, saying \"She is the life and soul of this riotous party, and you will be sad to see her disposed of, no matter that Mason's ghastly manner has earned it.\"[167] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, \"An enormously ambitious, visually stunning and richly satisfying futuristic epic from the gifted Korean genre director Bong Joon-ho.\" Foundas added that Beltrami's original score was \"among the generally impeccable craft contributions [to the film]\".[168]\n\nJames Rocchi of Film.com wrote that, \"If the film has one element that never flags or falters, it's Evans.\"[169]\n\nSome were more critical of the film. Jordan Adler of We've Got This Covered wrote \"We leave Snowpiercer more exhausted with questions than invigorated by its unique vision and style. It is a formidable example of directorial control bogged down by poor writing, half-finished effects work and a rather thin exploration of a fascinating dystopian universe.\"[170] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post found otherwise potentially good acting to be \"virtually lost in a tonal mishmash that can never decide between thoughtful political metaphor, lightheartedness and pulverizing violence\" and went on to describe the director's \"tiresome, slow-motion fetishism, mixing costumes and weaponry in an effort to distract from the scenes' sheer repetitiveness.\"[171]\n\n### Critics' top ten lists\n\nIn 2020, Snowpiercer was ranked by The Guardian number 8 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema.[172] The film appeared on several critics' lists of the top ten best films of 2014.[173]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                                     | Date of ceremony    | Category                                | Recipients                                                                                      | Result    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists[174]                   | 12 January 2015     | Best Supporting Actress                 | Tilda Swinton                                                                                   | Won       |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Director                           | Bong Joon-ho                                                                                    | Won       |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Supporting Actor                   | Song Kang-ho                                                                                    | Nominated |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Supporting Actress                 | Tilda Swinton                                                                                   | Nominated |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Cinematography                     | Hong Kyung-pyo                                                                                  | Nominated |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Editing                            | Steve M.

For 17 years, the remnants of humanity shelter in a state-of-the-art self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\n        \n        Urged by his mentor Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist. For his assistance, they bribe him with Kronole, an addictive drug made from industrial waste. Namgoong also insists that his clairvoyant daughter, Yona, be freed. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress, but they face guards armed with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis sacrifices him to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender while Edgar is killed. The tail mob stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who had their children taken from them) towards the front of the train.\n        \n        Curtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and speculate that the ice may be thawing more and more with every year. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to celebrate the train's eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. Then the bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with automatic firearms hidden under the eggs. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, which prompts Curtis to execute Mason in turn. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is then seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong.\n        \n        In the last compartment before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can now survive outside. Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, the tail section resorted to cannibalism. Edgar was an infant when Curtis killed his mother, and Curtis was going to eat him when Gilliam offered his severed arm instead, stopping the bloodshed. Curtis wants to confront Wilford for causing such horrors. Wilford's assistant, Claude, emerges from behind the engine room door to invite Curtis inside.\n        \n        Curtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. After ordering the execution of most of the tail section residents, Wilford offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept as Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and asks for a match. In desperation, she pulls open a floorboard to reveal Tanya's son, Timmy, working the engine as a replacement for a broken machine part, taken from his mother to be a slave. Appalled, Curtis beats up Wilford and rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the process. Andy, Andrew's missing son, crawls out of a nook and climbs into the engine core despite Curtis's pleas. Curtis gives Yona the match to light the fuse for the Kronole bomb, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who followed them. Damaged by the fighting, the door to the engine room cannot be closed, forcing Curtis and Namgoong to use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast.\n        \n        The explosion triggers an avalanche that derails and wrecks the train. Curtis and Namgoong are unresponsive, so Yona and Timmy escape the wreckage. They see a polar bear in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train and did not die out as they were first led to believe.\n    </Plot>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to be more readable while ensuring that the key attributes are highlighted with the appropriate XML tags.

It is based on the French science fiction comics series Valérian and Laureline, written by Pierre Christin, illustrated by Jean-Claude Mézières, and published by Dargaud. It stars Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne as Valerian and Laureline, respectively, with Clive Owen, Rihanna, Ethan Hawke, Herbie Hancock, Kris Wu and Rutger Hauer in supporting roles. Besson independently financed and personally funded the film. With a production budget of around $180 million, it is both the most expensive European and the most expensive independent film ever made.[11]\n\nTwo operatives of the United Human Federation are on a mission to Alpha, a city inhabited by thousands of species from different planets. Their latest mission is to uncover a destructive force beneath the sprawling city, realizing it threatens not just Alpha, but the entire universe.\n\nValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets was released on 20 July 2017 in Germany by Buena Vista International and Universum Film, in the United States on 21 July by STXfilms, in France on 26 July by EuropaCorp Distribution, in China on 25 August by China Film Group, in Belgium on 26 August by Belga Films, and 27 November in United Arab Emirates by Gulf Film.[12][13] It received mixed reviews from critics, who criticised the plot and some of the casting, but praised the visuals. It grossed $226 million worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, was considered a box-office bomb following its release in the United States.[14][15][16]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the 28th century, cooperation between the Earth and extraterrestrial species has expanded the former International Space Station to the point its mass threatens gravitational disruption to Earth. Relocated to deep space, it becomes Alpha, a space-traveling city inhabited by 3,236 species from hundreds of planets. Valerian and Laureline are partners in the United Human Federation police.\n\nValerian has a dream of the planet Mül, where a low-tech humanoid race fishes for pearls containing energy, which is converted by a small animal for use. A huge spacecraft crashes into the planet, causing an extinction event. Some of Mül's inhabitants survive in a previously crashed vessel, but the planet's princess, Lihö-Minaa, is stranded outside. Just before death, she conveys an energy wave containing a telepathic message.\n\nValerian and Laureline are on a mission to retrieve the last Mül converter animal, which is in the hands of black market dealer Igon Siruss. In a marketplace on planet Kirian in an alternate dimension, Valerian disrupts a meeting between Igon and two hooded figures similar to the humanoids from his dream. They, too, seek the converter. Valerian and Laureline recover the converter, and Valerian steals an energy pearl. They learn that Mül was destroyed 30 years earlier, and information about it is classified.\n\nOnboard Alpha, commander Arün Filitt informs them that an unknown force increasingly irradiates the station's center, and troops sent into the area have not returned. Laureline and Valerian are assigned to protect the commander during an interstation summit on the crisis; against the commander's wishes, Laureline maintains possession of the converter.\n\nDuring the summit, Mül humanoids attack and kidnap Filitt. Valerian chases the kidnappers to the irradiated area but crashes his spaceplane. Laureline enlists alien information brokers to find Valerian at the edge of the irradiated zone. She is kidnapped by a primitive tribe and presented as the choice course at their emperor's dinner. Valerian infiltrates the tribe's territory with the help of the shape-shifting Bubble. Laureline and Valerian escape, but Bubble is fatally wounded. Valerian and Laureline venture into the irradiated area, discovering it is not dangerous and contains an antique spacecraft. They find the humanoids, the Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt.\n\nPearl Emperor Haban Limaï explains that his people lived peacefully on Mül until a battle occurred in their world between the Federation and a hostile alien race. The human commander Filitt ordered to use fusion missiles to destroy the enemy mothership, but inadvertently resulted in Mül's destruction. Upon her death, Princess Lihö-Minaa transferred her soul into Valerian's body. Trapped in a downed spaceship, the surviving Pearls repaired it and learned human technology and history. Scrap ships took them to Alpha, where they assimilated knowledge from different species and built their own ship. They need the converter and pearl to launch it, so they find a new home.\n\nFilitt admits his role in the genocide but argues it was necessary to end the war and cover it up to prevent humans from losing credibility and influence in Alpha. Valerian and Laureline argue that the commander is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions. When Filitt becomes belligerent, Valerian knocks him out.\n\nValerian hands over the pearl he took from Igon, and Laureline persuades him to return the converter. While the Pearls prepare their spacecraft for takeoff, Filitt's K-Tron robot soldiers attack them, but Valerian and surviving government soldiers defeat the robots. The spacecraft departs, and Filitt is arrested.\n\nValerian and Laureline are left adrift aboard an Apollo Command/Service Module, where she answers his marriage proposal with a \"maybe\" as they await rescue.\n\n## Cast\n\nDelevingne, DeHaan, and Besson were at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con presentation of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets at Camp Conival.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Dane DeHaan as Valerian, a United Human Federation soldier and Laureline's partner/love interest[12]\n- Cara Delevingne as Laureline, a United Human Federation soldier and Valerian's partner/love interest[12]\n- Clive Owen as Arün Filitt, Valerian and Laureline's commander[12]\n- Rihanna as the human form of Bubble, a shapeshifting Glamopod entertainer.[13]\n- Ethan Hawke as Jolly the Pimp, Bubble's \"protector\".[12]\n- Herbie Hancock as Defence Minister[13]\n- Kris Wu as Sergeant Neza[17][18]\n- Rutger Hauer as The President of the World State Federation\n- John Goodman as Igon Siruss (voice), a Kodar'Khan pirate captain and the galaxy's most-wanted criminal[19]\n- Elizabeth Debicki as Emperor Haban Limaï (voice)[20]\n- Sasha Luss as Princess Lihö-Minaa (also credited as Creature \"Candy Dress\" in Paradise Alley)\n- Sam Spruell as General Okto Bar\n- Ola Rapace as Major Gibson\n- Alain Chabat as Bob the Pirate\n- Thom Findlay as The Pirates (voice)\n- Mathieu Kassovitz as Camelot on Big Market\n- Jonas Bloquet as K-Tron Warrior/Control Room Soldier\n- Sand Van Roy as Jessica Rabbit Creature\n- Louis Leterrier as Captain Welcoming Mercurys\n- Olivier Megaton as Captain Welcoming KCO2\n- Gavin Drea as Sergeant Cooper\n- Eric Lampaert as Guide Thaziit, a human guiding tourists in the Big Market\n- Claire Tran as Control room Sergeant\n- Pauline Hoarau as Empress Aloi\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nAlthough Luc Besson loved the Valerian comics while growing up, he did not seriously consider adapting them into a movie until he was working on The Fifth Element. During development, Besson had hired Valerian illustrator Jean-Claude Mézières to work on the film, who asked Besson, \"Why are you doing this shitty film? Why you don't do Valerian?\"[21] At the time, Besson felt that making the film was \"impossible\" given the vast alien-to-human ratio.[21] The release of Avatar served as both a blessing and a curse for Besson; he has said, \"technically, I could see that we can do everything now. The film proved that imagination is the only limit.\" However, he also felt that \"James Cameron pushed all the levels so high\", which made him believe that his script was not good enough, so he rewrote it.[21] Ultimately, the storyboarding for the film took seven months.[22]\n\nThe project was first publicly reported in 2012.[23] The two principal stars, Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne, were announced in May 2015.[24] On 19 August 2015, Clive Owen signed on to play Commander Arün Filitt in the film.[25] The budget, €197 million, is by far the largest ever assembled for a French film. Previously, Asterix at the Olympic Games was the most expensive, at €78 million, just ahead of Besson's The Fifth Element (€75 million).[26] By the end of August 2015, Besson said in an RTL radio interview that shooting the film in France was too expensive. Because it was filmed in a foreign language (English), Besson was unable to benefit from tax credits, despite preferring to produce the film in France and create jobs for 1,200 crew members.[26][27] The criteria to obtain these tax credits were then adapted accordingly. In May 2015, it was announced Fundamental Films would invest US$50 million in the film.[28]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on 5 January 2016 in seven sound stages dedicated to the film at the Cité du Cinéma, in Saint-Denis, north of Paris.[22][29] In total, there are 2,734 visual effect shots.[30] The humanoid race the Pearls were completely synthetic creations by Weta Digital, which generated the characters from performances by actors with motion-capture equipment for their faces and bodies.[31]\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe trailer featured the Beatles song \"Because\", which is the first time a Beatles master recording had been featured outside a Beatles film advertisement.[32]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nIndustrial Light and Magic, Weta Digital and Rodeo FX provided the effects for the film with Scott Stokdyk as the main supervisor.[33]\n\n## Release\n\nThe first teaser for Valerian was released on 10 November 2016.[34] The teaser depicts Marmakas, an Entertainer (Bubble, identified as \"Glamopod\" in the film), Bagoulins, and Shingouz (known as \"Doghan Daguis\" in the film), who all appear in the comic book Ambassador of the Shadows; much of the film's setting and story is also derived from that instalment. A special exclusive preview of Valerian was shown prior to the Fathom Events 4K restoration showing of The Fifth Element on 14 May and 17 May.[35][36]\n\nValerian was released in Israel on 20 July 2017,[37] on 21 July in the United States, on 26 July in France.[38] and on 2 August in the UK [39] Lionsgate handles the film's release in the United Kingdom and Ireland,[40] and STX Entertainment distributes the film in the United States.[41] The film was  released on 25 August 2017 in China.[42]\n\n### Home media\n\nValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets was released online on 7 November 2017, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on 21 November 2017.[43][44]\n\n### Theme park attraction\n\nIn 2018, Europa-Park added VR to its roller coaster, Eurosat - CanCan Coaster themed around Valerian as part of the roller coaster's refurbishment before it closed in 2024 and reopened as a Phantom of the Opera-themed experience that same year.\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe official soundtrack for Valerian was released on 21 July 2017 on vinyl, CD, and download.[45] The total duration of this soundtrack album is exactly the same number of minutes as the duration of the film itself — 137 minutes.\n\n### Track listing\n\n|   No. | Title                                | Artist(s)                               | Length   |\n|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Big Market\" (written by Luc Besson) | Alexandre Desplat                       | 2:05     |\n|     2 | \"Space Oddity\"                       | David Bowie                             | 5:18     |\n|     3 | \"I Feel Everything\"                  | Cara Delevingne                         | 3:02     |\n|     4 | \"Jamming\"                            | Bob Marley                              | 3:19     |\n|     5 | \"Bus Attack\"                         | Alexandre Desplat                       | 3:08     |\n|     6 | \"We Trying to Stay Alive\"            | Wyclef Jean featuring Pras &amp;

The film ended up debuting to $17 million, finishing 5th at the box office, leading Deadline Hollywood to already label the film a domestic box office bomb,[9] and causing an 8.31% fall of the EuropaCorp stock on the following Monday.[15] In its second weekend, the film dropped 62% to $6.4 million, finishing 8th at the box office.[47] In its third and fourth weekends the film made $2.4 million and $901,323, finishing 12th and 17th and dropping another 62% both times.[48]\n\nOutside North America, the film opened in 16 markets alongside the US and made $6.5 million over its opening weekend, including $2.5 million in Germany.[49] In France, the film made $3.72 million (€3.19 million) on its first day, the second-best opening day of 2017 there behind Despicable Me 3.[50] In China, the film made $9.9 million on its first day from 78,000 screens, becoming the first film to displace Wolf Warriors 2 at the country's box office.[51] It went on to open to $29 million, topping the box office.[52] The largest territory for the film was China, with US$62.1 million.[2]\n\n### Critical response\n\nValerian and the City of a Thousand Planets received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visuals while criticizing the plot and some of the casting.[16] On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 300 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets uses sheer kinetic energy and visual thrills to overcome narrative obstacles and offer a viewing experience whose surreal pleasures often outweigh its flaws.\"[53] On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[54] On French entertainment information website AlloCiné, the film has an average grade of 3.0/5, based on 31 critics.[55] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.[9]\n\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of B−, praising how \"unapologetically idiosyncratic\" the film is, while also saying \"the vividness of this place only underscores the lifelessness of the people leading us through it .... There are 394 million stories on the City of a Thousand Planets, and Valerian's might be the only one we've seen before. Still, any excuse to visit this place is one worth taking.\"[56] Peter Sciretta of /Film touted the first half of Valerian as \"unpredictable and bonkers insane\", while calling the second half more formulaic and \"far less exciting\", though he still encouraged seeing the film in 3D \"on the biggest screen possible\".[57] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club wrote that it was \"rare […] to see a film this extravagant that also feels, for better or worse, like the work of a single personality. The longer action scenes may not always rank with Besson's early '90s highlights [...] or the mania of the more recent Lucy, but there isn't a moment in this ludicrous, lushly self-indulgent movie that doesn't feel like its creator is having the time of his life.\"[58]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a negative review, saying: \"The Razzies don't need to wait until the end of the year to anoint a winner for 2017 ... Hollywood studio chiefs can breathe easy that, this time, at least, they'll escape blame for making a giant summer franchise picture that nobody wants to see, since this one's a French import.\"[59] A. O. Scott of The New York Times was also less than happy with the film, writing the effort \"feels as if it were made up on the spot, by someone so delighted by the gaudy genre packaging at his disposal that he lost track of what was supposed to be inside.\"[60] National Public Radio film critic, Mark Jenkins, wrote in a negative review that the film's \"perspective often seems more 19th- than 26th-century, notably in a sequence where Laureline is captured by members of a hostile species and forced to don a white dress to be presented to their emperor. The blobby computer-generated creatures resemble natives from the most racist of Tarzan movies.\"[61]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 44th Saturn Awards, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets was nominated for the Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Production Design (Hugues Tissandier), and Best Costume Design (Olivier Bériot); all respectively lost to Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Black Panther (2018, Hannah Beachler), and Beauty and the Beast (2017, Jacqueline Durran).[62]\n\n## Potential sequel\n\nThough the film was a box office bomb, director Luc Besson claimed in September 2017 that a sequel was still possible due to positive fan reaction.[63]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films featuring space stations\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Cabin, Chris (20 September 2016). \"Alexandre Desplat Moves from 'Rogue One' to 'Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets'\".

It is based on the French science fiction comics series Valérian and Laureline, written by Pierre Christin, illustrated by Jean-Claude Mézières, and published by Dargaud. \n\n        It stars <MainCharacters><Character>Dane DeHaan</Character> and <Character>Cara Delevingne</Character> as Valerian and Laureline, respectively, with <Character>Clive Owen</Character>, <Character>Rihanna</Character>, <Character>Ethan Hawke</Character>, <Character>Herbie Hancock</Character>, <Character>Kris Wu</Character>, and <Character>Rutger Hauer</Character> in supporting roles.</MainCharacters> \n\n        Besson independently financed and personally funded the film. With a production budget of around $180 million, it is both the most expensive European and the most expensive independent film ever made.\n\n        <PlotComplexity>In the 28th century</PlotComplexity>, cooperation between the Earth and extraterrestrial species has expanded the former International Space Station to the point its mass threatens gravitational disruption to Earth. Relocated to deep space, it becomes Alpha, a space-traveling city inhabited by 3,236 species from hundreds of planets. Valerian and Laureline are partners in the United Human Federation police.\n\n        Valerian has a dream of the planet Mül, where a low-tech humanoid race fishes for pearls containing energy, which is converted by a small animal for use. A huge spacecraft crashes into the planet, causing an extinction event. Some of Mül's inhabitants survive in a previously crashed vessel, but the planet's princess, Lihö-Minaa, is stranded outside. Just before death, she conveys an energy wave containing a telepathic message.\n\n        Valerian and Laureline are on a mission to retrieve the last Mül converter animal, which is in the hands of black market dealer Igon Siruss. In a marketplace on planet Kirian in an alternate dimension, Valerian disrupts a meeting between Igon and two hooded figures similar to the humanoids from his dream. They, too, seek the converter. Valerian and Laureline recover the converter, and Valerian steals an energy pearl. They learn that Mül was destroyed 30 years earlier, and information about it is classified.\n\n        Onboard Alpha, commander Arün Filitt informs them that an unknown force increasingly irradiates the station's center, and troops sent into the area have not returned. Laureline and Valerian are assigned to protect the commander during an interstation summit on the crisis; against the commander's wishes, Laureline maintains possession of the converter.\n\n        During the summit, Mül humanoids attack and kidnap Filitt. Valerian chases the kidnappers to the irradiated area but crashes his spaceplane. Laureline enlists alien information brokers to find Valerian at the edge of the irradiated zone. She is kidnapped by a primitive tribe and presented as the choice course at their emperor's dinner. Valerian infiltrates the tribe's territory with the help of the shape-shifting Bubble. Laureline and Valerian escape, but Bubble is fatally wounded. Valerian and Laureline venture into the irradiated area, discovering it is not dangerous and contains an antique spacecraft. They find the humanoids, the Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt.\n\n        Pearl Emperor Haban Limaï explains that his people lived peacefully on Mül until a battle occurred in their world between the Federation and a hostile alien race. The human commander Filitt ordered to use fusion missiles to destroy the enemy mothership, but inadvertently resulted in Mül's destruction. Upon her death, Princess Lihö-Minaa transferred her soul into Valerian's body. Trapped in a downed spaceship, the surviving Pearls repaired it and learned human technology and history. Scrap ships took them to Alpha, where they assimilated knowledge from different species and built their own ship. They need the converter and pearl to launch it, so they find a new home.\n\n        Filitt admits his role in the genocide but argues it was necessary to end the war and cover it up to prevent humans from losing credibility and influence in Alpha. Valerian and Laureline argue that the commander is trying to avoid the consequences of his actions. When Filitt becomes belligerent, Valerian knocks him out.\n\n        Valerian hands over the pearl he took from Igon, and Laureline persuades him to return the converter. While the Pearls prepare their spacecraft for takeoff, Filitt's K-Tron robot soldiers attack them, but Valerian and surviving government soldiers defeat the robots. The spacecraft departs, and Filitt is arrested.\n\n        Valerian and Laureline are left adrift aboard an Apollo Command/Service Module, where she answers his marriage proposal with a \"maybe\" as they await rescue.\n    </Content>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key information is highlighted with appropriate XML tags while maintaining the readability and integrity of the original article.",

Movies don't always have to have some huge plan and scheme. I, for one, would love to see Dave Bautista just living out a portion of his life in the Blade Runner world, having adventures and just being Sapper Morton. Most directors can't pull off the big event anyway. Why can't we have less convoluted and straight-to-the-point stories?

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Doctor Strange (2016) and the 28th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Sam Raimi, written by Michael Waldron, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, alongside Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Rachel McAdams. In the film, Strange must protect America Chavez (Gomez), a teenager capable of traveling the multiverse, from the Scarlet Witch (Olsen).\n\nDoctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson had plans for a sequel by October 2016. He signed to return as director in December 2018, when Cumberbatch was confirmed to return. The film's title was announced in July 2019 along with Olsen's involvement, while Jade Halley Bartlett was hired to write the film that October. Derrickson stepped down as director in January 2020, citing creative differences. Waldron and Raimi joined the following month and started over, adding elements of the horror genre that Raimi had worked with previously and making Wanda the villain of the film, continuing her story from the Disney+ miniseries WandaVision (2021). Filming began in November 2020 in London but was put on hold in January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed by March 2021 and concluded in mid-April in Somerset. Shooting also occurred in Surrey and Los Angeles. With a production budget of $350.6 million, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on May 2, 2022, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $955.8 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2022.\n\n## Plot\n\nA demon chases America Chavez and a version of Stephen Strange in the space between universes while searching for the Book of Vishanti. Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616,[a] where that universe's version of Stephen Strange rescues Chavez from another demon[b] with help from Wong, the Sorcerer Supreme. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse.\n\nRecognizing witchcraft runes on the demon, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff but soon realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Wanda believes that taking Chavez's powers and traveling through the multiverse will allow her to reunite with Billy and Tommy, the children she created during her time in Westview.[c] When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838. Wanda uses the Darkhold to \"dreamwalk\", taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. After a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dreamwalk, an enraged Wanda forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dreamwalk.\n\nWhile searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo, and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter, Blackagar Boltagon, Maria Rambeau, Reed Richards, and Charles Xavier. They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying \"incursion\". After defeating Thanos, the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Wanda reestablishes her dreamwalk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before the Illuminati can pass judgment. She brutally kills all the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 version of Strange's ex-fiancé, Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati.\n\nStrange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis of the Darkhold, but Wanda appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind and uses her powers to send Strange and Palmer to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his Darkhold, and then uses that Darkhold to dreamwalk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Wanda and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. Chavez transports Wanda to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy fearfully recoiling from her while crying for their real mother. Realizing her errors, Wanda relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.\n\nSome time later, Kamar-Taj is under repair and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dreamwalking into a corpse. In a mid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress[d] who warns that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help repair. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension.\n\n## Cast\n\nCumberbatch and Olsen announcing the film at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange:\nA neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident.[9][10] Writer Michael Waldron said Strange was \"at the height of his powers\" in the film,[11] and compared the character to Indiana Jones as a hero who can \"take a punch\", but with the intellect of chef Anthony Bourdain.[12] He saw Strange as a \"great adventure hero you just like to watch kick ass\".[13] Director Sam Raimi explained that Strange begins the film believing that he should be making all decisions, and must learn to \"let go a little bit\" and trust in others.[14] Cumberbatch also portrays three alternate versions of the character:[15][16] the Earth-617 version who dies at the beginning of the film and wears a costume inspired by Matt Fraction's 2011 Defenders comic book series;[17][18] the former Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-838 who founded the Illuminati; and a version who has been corrupted by the Darkhold.[17]\n- Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch:\nA former Avenger gone rogue who can harness chaos magic, engage in telepathy and telekinesis, and alter reality.[19][20] The film continues Wanda's \"ownership of what makes her unique and the accountability of her life experience\" that began in the series WandaVision (2021),[21] including using an accent that is more true to her Sokovian heritage after some of the previous MCU projects had seen her use a more Americanized accent.[7] Olsen wanted to ensure Wanda's role in the film honored the events of the series,[22] requesting some adjustments to the film to ensure that it evolved the character rather than repeating moments from WandaVision.[23] She felt the film's portrayal showed a new confidence for the character that was \"really empowering\", and said it was \"okay to play characters that people get frustrated with sometimes\".[24] Olsen also portrays the character's Earth-838 counterpart.[25][26]\n- Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo:\nThe Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-838 and a member of the Illuminati.[27] He is an alternate version from the Mordo seen in the first film, which set him up as a future antagonist. That version does not appear in the sequel because he did not fit into the story, with Waldron explaining that they were focused on the Earth-838 version of the character and felt it was more exciting to leave the Earth-616 version for \"another day\".[28] An early version of the script included the Earth-616 version of Mordo in an opening sequence in which he would have been killed by Wanda.[29]\n- Benedict Wong as Wong:\nThe Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-616 and Strange's mentor and friend.[30][31] The actor was happy to hear that his character would be the Sorcerer Supreme and stand \"toe-to-toe with Doctor Strange\",[32] serving as the voice of reason for Strange who ultimately faces consequences for ignoring Wong's advice.[33] The actor had more action scenes in this film and prepared by training with former rugby league player Shannon Hegarty.[32]\n- Xochitl Gomez as America Chavez:\nA teenager who can travel between dimensions by punching open doorways.[34][35] She originates from another universe known as the Utopian Parallel.[26][35] Gomez wanted to remain faithful to the source material despite playing a younger version of the character than is seen in the comics,[35] and said her journey in the film begins with the character having been alone for a long time and \"running away from her uniqueness\". Chavez has to embrace her abilities and learn to trust others by the film's end.[35][34] Marvel Studios had been looking for the right film to introduce the character in for a long time before settling on Multiverse of Madness.[34]\n- Michael Stuhlbarg as Nicodemus West:\nA surgeon and former colleague of Strange.[36] Stuhlbarg was also planned to portray his Earth-838 counterpart but could only film one scene, as the Earth-616 version, due to scheduling conflicts. The Earth-838 version would have worked for the Illuminati, and the protagonists would have found his head in an elevator after he was killed by Wanda off-screen, similar to the death of Samuel L. Jackson's Ray Arnold in Jurassic Park (1993).[28]\n- Rachel McAdams as Christine Palmer:\nAn emergency surgeon who was a colleague and lover of Strange.[37] The film explores Strange's decision at the end of Doctor Strange (2016) to protect the New York Sanctum and not be with Palmer, despite still having feelings for her and possibly regretting that decision,[38] with Palmer marrying someone else in this film.[25] McAdams also portrays the character's Earth-838 counterpart, who is an employee of the Baxter Foundation and the former lover of that reality's Strange.[25] McAdams described this version of the character as a \"Multiversal expert\" who allowed her to have more action scenes compared to the first film.[39][40] She has \"a lot more baggage\" than the original version of the character due to the Earth-838 version of Strange being corrupted,[39] but her storyline with the Earth-616 Strange helps resolve his love story with his own version of Palmer.[41]\n\nThe Illuminati of Earth-838 also includes Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, portraying a different version of the character that he previously played in 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series; Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter / Captain Carter, after voicing another version in the animated series What If...? (2021); Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel, an alternate version of her character from Captain Marvel (2019); Anson Mount as Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt, an alternate version of his role from Marvel's ABC television series Inhumans (2017); and John Krasinski as Reed Richards, a member of the Fantastic Four.[27]\n\nJulian Hilliard and Jett Klyne portray the Earth-838 versions of Wanda's sons Billy and Tommy, reprising their respective roles from WandaVision,[42] while Topo Wresniwiro reprises his role from the first film as Hamir, a Master of the Mystic Arts.[43][44] Also appearing in the film are Sheila Atim as Sara, a Master of the Mystic Arts,[45] and Adam Hugill as the voice of Rintrah, a minotaur-like being from R'Vaal who is a student at Kamar-Taj.[46] Ross Marquand voices the Ultron drones that appear on Earth-838. Marquand previously voiced a different version of Ultron in What If...?,[47] replacing James Spader, who portrayed the Earth-616 Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).[48] The character Clea is introduced in the mid-credits scene, portrayed by Charlize Theron,[8] and Waldron makes a cameo appearance as a guest at Palmer's wedding.[49] Bruce Campbell, a frequent collaborator with Raimi, briefly appears in both the main film and post-credits scene as the vendor of an Earth-838 food stall called Pizza Poppa.[50] Scott Spiegel, another frequent collaborator with Raimi, voices one of the Souls of the Damned that attack Strange when he possesses a corpse. Co-producer Richie Palmer also voices one of the Souls of the Damned.[51]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDoctor Strange (2016) co-writer C. Robert Cargill stated in April 2016 that Marvel Studios felt some initial ideas for the film from him and director Scott Derrickson highlighted too much of the \"weird stuff\" associated with the comic book character Doctor Strange to feature in an origin story, but told the duo to hold onto them for potential future films.[52] Derrickson revealed in October that he had plans for a sequel, expressing his love for the character and the visual possibilities that come with him. Derrickson said the first film was \"the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made.\" He wanted to follow the example of The Dark Knight (2008) and introduce a villain in the sequel that would allow them to \"go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Star Benedict Cumberbatch had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange film.[53] Derrickson expressed interest in featuring the villain Nightmare,[54] and further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir after their small roles in the first film. He explained that he had been \"kept in the loop\" on how the Avengers films were using Strange due to his close relationships with Joe Russo—the co-director of Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019)—and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige.[55] Doctor Strange co-writer Jon Spaihts expressed interest in seeing the character Clea appear in a sequel.[56] In April 2017, Derrickson was reported to be returning for a sequel, beginning work after fulfilling his commitments to the television series Locke &amp; Key (2020–2022).[57]\n\nOriginal director Scott Derrickson announcing the film at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy December 2018, Derrickson had quietly finalized a deal to direct the sequel, with Cumberbatch, Benedict Wong, and Rachel McAdams reprising their respective roles of Dr. Stephen Strange, Wong, and Christine Palmer. Marvel was beginning to search for a writer,[9][58] with The Hollywood Reporter stating that the script would be written throughout 2019 for a planned filming start in early 2020 and a potential release in May 2021.[9] Feige and Derrickson officially announced the sequel at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, revealing the title to be Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and confirming a release date of May 7, 2021.[19] Derrickson wanted the sequel to be the first scary Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film and explore more of the gothic and horror elements from the comic books than the first installment did,[19][59] with co-producer Richie Palmer explaining that the film would use the multiverse to explore \"each definition of the word madness\" and the idea that \"the scariest monsters are the ones that dwell within us\".[60] Feige revealed that the Disney+ series WandaVision (2021) would directly set up the film, with Elizabeth Olsen reprising her role of Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch from the series.[19][61] Additionally, the concept of the multiverse was introduced to the MCU in the first season of Loki (2021),[62] and explored further in the film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), which is set before Multiverse of Madness and sees Cumberbatch reprising his role as Strange.[63][15] After Loki's first-season finale was released, Tom Hiddleston was reported to be reprising his role as Loki in Multiverse of Madness,[64] but ultimately did not appear.[65]\n\nJade Halley Bartlett, an \"up-and-coming screenwriter\", was hired to write the sequel's screenplay in October 2019.[66] Barlett said she had developed the film alongside Derrickson, Feige, and other Marvel Studios executives Louis D'Esposito, Eric Hauserman Carroll, and Palmer for around a year, a process she felt was fun and exciting, and called the creative team scholars of the comic books. She was provided with a binder of every Doctor Strange comic book printed for reference to aid her writing.[67] In December, Feige described the multiverse as \"the next step in the evolution of the MCU\", and said this film would \"crack it wide open\" in a way that would have repercussions for the Disney+ series and the next films in Marvel Studios' Phase Four slate.[68] Later in the month, he clarified that the sequel would not be a horror film, as some reports had described it following the Comic-Con announcement, but it would be a \"big MCU film with scary sequences\". Feige compared these sequences to the films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), Gremlins (1984), and Poltergeist (1982), and said Derrickson was good at being \"legitimately scary\" due to his background making horror films. Feige also revealed that the film would introduce several surprising new characters to the MCU, including one that Marvel Studios had been looking for a way to use in an MCU film for some time;[69] this was later revealed to be America Chavez, who was included because her powers are related to the multiverse.[34] Chavez's co-creator Joe Casey was not paid for the character's appearance in the film after he rejected a compensation offer from Marvel Comics that he described as a \"pittance\".[70]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nIn January 2020, Marvel Studios and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences. In separate statements, they both said they were thankful for their collaboration so far and Derrickson would remain an executive producer on the film.[71] This was not expected to delay filming, which was set for May 2020.[71][72] Cargill explained that he and Derrickson conceived a story that went in a different direction from what Marvel wanted,[73] and the pair had not yet written a draft of the screenplay so the final film would not be derivative of their work.[74] Derrickson said leaving the film was a difficult decision, but he did not want to compromise on a film that was different from what he wanted to make. His choice to leave was made easier by the fact that he was able to immediately begin work on The Black Phone (2022), another film he wanted to make.[73] Cumberbatch was not consulted regarding the director change and said he was sad to hear about it, but he respected the decision and how it was handled.[75] Some reports suggested that Derrickson left the film because he wanted to make a \"no-holds-barred weird, gnarly, scary movie\" similar to A24's films The Witch (2015) or Hereditary (2018), and Marvel Studios did not want to go in that direction, but Feige denied this and said the studio loved that idea. He explained that it was their intention for the film to serve as a guide into a \"much creepier side\" of the MCU, even after Derrickson's departure,[76] and they wanted to explore the \"mind-bending frightening side\" of the multiverse.[77]\n\nSam Raimi took over as director during pre-production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSam Raimi entered negotiations to take over as director by early February.[31] At that time, Chiwetel Ejiofor was expected to reprise his role as Karl Mordo, McAdams was no longer expected to appear,[31] and Michael Waldron was hired to rewrite the film's script after serving as the head writer of Loki's first season.[78][79] Raimi signed on to direct the film a few weeks later.[12] He had been reluctant to direct another Marvel superhero film after the mixed critical reaction to Spider-Man 3 (2007),[80] feeling that he needed a break from that genre,[81] but he accepted the job because of the challenge of getting the film into production right away and because he was a fan of the Doctor Strange character and Derrickson's work on the first film.[80][81] Raimi was curious how making big-budgeted films had changed since his prior film, Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), and he also had to familiarize himself with the existing MCU storylines and characters for the film.[81] Waldron had three weeks to write a new script draft based on the work done by Derrickson and Bartlett. He said this was \"almost impossible\",[82] and Raimi felt \"very rushed and panicked\" trying to meet the May 2020 production start date.[83] The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact film productions during those first three weeks,[82] and pre-production started taking place remotely.[84] Filming was initially still on track to begin in May 2020,[72] until Disney shifted much of their Phase Four slate of films due to the pandemic, moving Multiverse of Madness's release date to November 5, 2021.[85] Raimi was relieved by this delay,[83] which allowed him and Waldron to start writing the script from scratch in a reasonable time, and make the film their own.[82][86] Bartlett had written a draft before the COVID-19 pandemic and said that Raimi and Waldron's version was different from the one she developed with Derrickson.[67]\n\nWaldron watched the director's Spider-Man films (2002–2007) so he could identify Raimi's strengths and write toward them.[87] He described Multiverse of Madness as Raimi's return to \"big superhero movies\", and said it would have every aspect of a Sam Raimi film,[88] including a \"slightly scarier direction\" which he felt Raimi had a strong track record with.[86][88] Palmer said Waldron's work introducing the multiverse in Loki allowed Marvel Studios to \"jump into telling a good story\" without having to re-explain those ideas for the audience, and helped bring \"a lot of heart to [the] sci-fi concepts\".[89] Waldron also used his experience from writing the series Rick and Morty (2013–present), which helped him \"introduce these big sci-fi concepts in ways that were digestible, palatable to the audience and without getting them bogged down in the boring details\".[90] Rather than just expanding the stakes of the film, Waldron saw the multiverse as the \"emotional heart\" of the story that could be used in personal ways, such as using \"what ifs\" and alternate versions of characters to reflect on the film's protagonists, and exploring the characters' right or wrong choices through their alternate versions. Waldron watched Doctor Strange several times, saying he became a \"student\" of that film, to understand Strange's story in the original. He also looked at how the character had developed through his other MCU appearances,[91] and Raimi praised how Waldron's imagination and knowledge of Marvel history contributed to the script.[83] The creative team saw early production work for the animated series What If...? (2021–present) to learn how Strange was portrayed in that series.[92]\n\nWaldron described Wanda as \"the biggest best bullet\" that they had,[93] and said she was destined to become a villain in the MCU, as she did in the comics, especially after the end of WandaVision revealed \"to her that the family she's built is not real. Then she gets the Darkhold... and learns that there is a real version of her children out there. And if you've got the Book of the Damned whispering in your ear long enough that your kids are out there and you could go get 'em, maybe that can push you to do some terrible things.\"[82] If she became a villain at the end of the film, he knew another project would get to have the \"fun\" of using her as a villain. He also wanted to avoid the film getting \"overstuffed\" by adding a different multiverse-related villain such as Jonathan Majors's Kang the Conqueror,[93] and felt that this would create a \"watered-down version of Wanda [who] wouldn't be the protagonist, and she wouldn't really be the antagonist\".[82] Olsen was hesitant about playing the villain after believing that she would just be \"in an ensemble thing\", but she came to feel that the combination of WandaVision and Multiverse of Madness allowed her to create a sympathetic character in the series who the audience would therefore have conflicted feelings about when seeing the film.[23] Waldron worked closely with Olsen and WandaVision head writer Jac Schaeffer to ensure Wanda's story was a satisfying continuation of the series,[72] while Raimi also studied the series despite not fully seeing it, particularly key moments that directly impacted their plans for the film, to make sure the film maintained \"a proper through line and character-growth dynamic\" for her character.[83] It was important to Olsen that the film not repeat what was done in WandaVision and instead be an evolution of the character, and she requested several adjustments to the script to avoid moments that she found too similar to the series. To justify the many killings that Wanda commits in the film, Olsen focused on the character's perspective of those people being in her way and not listening to her after the loss of her children in the series.[23]\n\nAfter a planned appearance by Cumberbatch in WandaVision was removed late in the development of the series, rewrites to the Multiverse of Madness script were required which Feige described as a \"wonderful combination of very dedicated coordination, and chaos\".[94] These changes include how Strange and Wanda meet in the film.[7] The story of Multiverse of Madness is still set up by WandaVision, but the film was developed to also work for viewers who did not watch the series.[95] For consistency with the Darkhold's appearance, the film's props department designed the prop that was used for WandaVision and then reused it for the film.[96] While writing his first draft, Waldron felt the film needed to \"get drunk [and] find the madness in the multiverse\" by introducing alternate universe versions of known Marvel characters. This led to the introduction of the Illuminati, a secret society from the comics. Waldron had been watching the film Aliens (1986) as inspiration for the script's thriller tone, and enjoyed how the \"badass\" space marines \"just get slaughtered\" by the titular aliens to set the latter up as scarier villains for the rest of that film. He wanted to do something similar with Wanda by introducing the Illuminati as a group of characters that fans would be excited to see and then have Wanda kill them all. The idea of Strange taking control of a dead body for the end of the film came from Waldron and Palmer discussing how he would be able to confront Wanda from a different universe, with the corpse of another version of Strange having been already established at the start of the film. Raimi, Feige, and Cumberbatch were all excited about the idea, despite Raimi initially wanting to avoid a zombie sequence to not repeat what he had done previously with zombie films.[82]\n\nThe film's release was shifted again at the end of April 2020, this time to March 25, 2022, after Sony Pictures rescheduled No Way Home to the November 2021 date.[97] Until then, Waldron had been writing the script expecting Multiverse of Madness to be released before No Way Home. He was in contact with No Way Home writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers throughout the writing process, and after the release date change they adjusted their respective scripts so instead of Multiverse of Madness \"blowing the lid on the multiverse\" it would pick up after No Way Home with Strange already having multiverse experience. This change had a \"knock-down effect\" on the rest of the script.[93] There had been early plans to include Strange's new costume from Multiverse of Madness and America Chavez in No Way Home,[98][70] while a brief cameo of Spider-Man was planned for Multiverse of Madness, but the pandemic ultimately prevented those plans from coming to fruition.[98] Raimi noted that where No Way Home saw characters from other universes enter the MCU, Multiverse of Madness features characters from the MCU entering the multiverse and exploring different universes.[26] Ejiofor confirmed his involvement in June,[99] and Xochitl Gomez joined the cast in October.[100] Cumberbatch revealed that month that filming would start in London by the beginning of November,[101][102] with the production not impacted by a national lockdown in England that was set for November 5 to December 2 due to increased COVID-19 cases.[103]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in November 2020 in London,[104][105] under the working title Stellar Vortex.[106] Filming was delayed from an initial May 2020 start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[72] Olsen began filming her scenes by November 25,[105] shooting back-to-back with WandaVision,[107] and found it odd to transition from the series back to starring in an MCU film.[108][109] At the beginning of December, filming was taking place at Longcross Studios in Longcross, Surrey,[110] where several New York City blocks and sets for the Sanctum Sanctorum were built by production designer Charlie Woods.[111] McAdams soon signed on to return as Palmer,[37] shortly before Feige officially confirmed her involvement on December 10 along with that of Ejiofor, Wong, and Gomez. He also revealed that Gomez would portray America Chavez.[112][113] Cumberbatch had begun filming his scenes by then, after completing his work on No Way Home.[105][114][115] He said the film was more collaborative than his previous MCU appearances, for which he felt like he was \"just along for the ride\".[116]\n\nMany of the actors, including Olsen,[117] Cumberbatch,[75] and Wong, were excited to be working with Raimi.[118] The director said many \"dimensionalized visuals\" were used during shooting to tell the film's story,[77] as he was able to use his preferred camera techniques such as using the camera and perspective to create a feeling of anxiety for audiences.[117][75][119] John Mathieson served as cinematographer,[12] and shot the film with Panavision DXL2 IMAX-certified cameras.[120] Raimi encouraged improvisation,[75][118] explaining that the cast could adapt their interactions due to their knowledge of their own characters and that the script often changed shortly before filming for those scenes began.[121] The ending of the film was still \"up in the air\" when filming began, and Cumberbatch said it took some time for the team to decide on one that tied together all of the characters' stories.[122] Waldron explained that they felt the ending was too happy following all the \"bad shit\" that occurs in the film and wanted to show that Strange would suffer consequences for his actions—including possessing the corpse of a different version of himself—which tied into Mordo's warning from the first film: \"The bill comes due.\" This led to them adding the ending scene where Strange develops a third eye in his forehead, and Waldron felt this was the sort of twist that horror films often end on.[82] Elaborating on that tone, Olsen said they were going for a \"horror show vibe\",[123] comparing it to Raimi's Evil Dead films with aspects of the horror genre such as \"constant fear\". She felt it was \"more than a glossy Indiana Jones movie\" and would be darker than those films,[124][119] with Raimi trying to make \"the scariest Marvel movie\"[108][109] and create \"as much tension for the audience\" as possible.[77]\n\nOlsen shot for three weeks before pandemic restrictions increased near the end of December due to a surge of COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom, with another lockdown in England announced from January 6, 2021.[125][126] The scenes of Scarlet Witch massacring the Illuminati were shot at the British Museum of London, with Marvel using CGI to add a new room with a glass entrance and a few statues for the background.[127] Filming resumed in early 2021, and at some point, Cumberbatch had to temporarily pause filming after being in close contact with a member of the production who had a false positive test.[75] In mid-March, Cumberbatch said they were in the middle of production,[114] and Ejiofor had begun filming his scenes in London by then.[128] Filming occurred at Broomfield Hill Car Park in Richmond Park for the week of March 25.[129] Shooting took place at Freemasons' Hall, London, for a few weeks in April.[130] On April 15, Feige said they were in the final week of filming,[131] with shooting taking place from that day until April 17 at Burrow Hill Cider Farm in Somerset. Jett Klyne and Julian Hilliard, who respectively portrayed Wanda's sons Tommy and Billy in WandaVision, were reportedly on set at the farm,[132] and were confirmed to be in the film in April 2022.[133]\n\n### Post-production\n\nBob Murawski and Tia Nolan co-edited the film.[134] Some additional photography had been completed by mid-September 2021,[135] with Olsen and Wong completing their work.[135][118] The film was once again delayed in October, this time to May 6, 2022.[136] Later that month, Cumberbatch said they were in the middle of more additional photography, with further reshoots set for November and December,[137] over at least six weeks in Los Angeles. The Hollywood Reporter said this photography was \"significant\" and included two weeks dedicated to filming that could not be completed during principal photography because of actor availability issues and COVID-related slowdowns.[138] Cumberbatch confirmed the reshoots were being used to make adjustments to already shot material, while also filming parts that \"were just impossible to do [during principal photography] because of logistics, COVID etc.\"[139] The Hollywood Reporter later reported that the reshoots would allow the film to have \"more fun with the multiverse\" by adding more cameo appearances and variants of established characters, similar to No Way Home and the first season of Loki.[140] The film's teaser trailer was released in late December and confirmed the involvement of Michael Stuhlbarg as Nicodemus West, reprising his role from Doctor Strange.[36] It also revealed that Cumberbatch would portray multiple versions of Strange in the film.[15] The reshoots reportedly wrapped during the week of December 13,[140] but additional filming continued in early January 2022. The latter was completed on January 8.[141] By the end of the month, Raimi had assembled a cut of the film that would be presented to test audiences, and said there was potential for more reshoots to occur if the test screenings found that clarification or improvement were needed;[142] Cumberbatch was working on further reshoots in the United Kingdom by March 13.[143]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActors reprising their roles from earlier Marvel media as members of the Illuminati include Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier, Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter, Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeau, Anson Mount as Black Bolt, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo. John Krasinski appears as Reed Richards, after having been a popular suggestion for the role.\n\nPatrick Stewart, who portrayed Charles Xavier / Professor X in the X-Men film series, was revealed to be appearing in the film in an undisclosed role with the release of the full trailer in February 2022;[144][16] Stewart was believed to be reprising the role of Xavier,[145] which had previously been the subject of speculation.[16] A poster for the film, released at the same time, additionally teased the inclusion of Peggy Carter / Captain Carter, a character who was introduced in What If...?.[146] Stewart initially denied that he was in the film,[147] but soon admitted that he was.[148] The trailer also revealed that Topo Wresniwiro would reprise his role of Hamir from Doctor Strange.[44][43] A creature resembling prominent Doctor Strange villain Shuma-Gorath appears in the film, but it is given the name Gargantos, which comes from a different comic book character, because the rights to the name Shuma-Gorath belong to Heroic Signatures.[6] Gargantos' eye was modeled after that of Olsen's to foreshadow her role as the film's antagonist.[149] The cosmic entity the Living Tribunal also makes a brief appearance.[150] Discussing Stewart's involvement, as well as assumptions based on the trailer that the Illuminati would be appearing in the film, Palmer said returning actors would not necessarily be portraying characters that had been seen before, and if Marvel Studios were to introduce the Illuminati they would do a \"more MCU-driven\" version of the group.[151]\n\nThe Illuminati's appearance was officially confirmed in March;[152] and the team features actors portraying new versions of their characters from previous projects: Stewart plays a new version of Xavier that combines elements from his previous performances, including a line of dialogue from X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), with elements from X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997);[153] Ejiofor plays a new version of Mordo; Hayley Atwell portrays Captain Carter after voicing the What If...? version; Lashana Lynch plays a different version of Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel from the one she portrayed in Captain Marvel (2019); and Anson Mount portrays an alternate version of Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt from his role in Marvel's ABC television series Inhumans (2017). Also in the group is John Krasinski as Fantastic Four member Reed Richards. Krasinski had been a popular suggestion for the role by fans for some time, especially since the announcement of a new Fantastic Four film set in the MCU.[27] When Lynch was approached to return, she assumed she would be playing an ancestor of Rambeau and was surprised to learn she would be an alternate version of Captain Marvel.[154] The Illuminati sequence was filmed in pieces, with many of the actors not being on set together. Krasinski's footage was filmed during reshoots to replace a planned cameo appearance by Daniel Craig, who chose not to film the role because he did not believe a single day of filming was worth the risk of catching COVID-19 and spreading it to his family.[155][156] Craig was reportedly set to portray the character Balder the Brave in the scene.[155] Olsen did not meet Krasinski while shooting the scene in which Scarlet Witch kills Richards, and she instead filmed the scene with a stand-in.[157] Due to safety protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Stewart and other leading actors filmed their scenes in isolation without other actors present, which he found to be frustrating and disappointing.[158]\n\nWaldron said the final line-up of the Illuminati was similar to the one in his first draft,[82] but with some other suggestions coming from Feige. Waldron considered including Namor, a member of the Illuminati in the comics, but Marvel Studios did not allow the character to appear in any MCU projects before the film Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), in which he was played by Tenoch Huerta;[153][159] Waldron's first draft also included an Earth-838 counterpart of Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne / The Wasp as a member of the Illuminati, who would have been killed by Wanda clapping her hands to kill her.[160] Storyboards by artist Soren Bendt for the Illuminati massacre scene suggest that, in addition to Balder the Brave, an Earth-838 counterpart of Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger, who was previously portrayed by Jeff Bridges in Iron Man (2008), was also considered for the group's lineup.[161] There were also rumors that Tom Cruise would be portraying an alternate version of Tony Stark / Iron Man known as Superior Iron Man in the film after being in contention for the role back in the 1990s before Robert Downey Jr. was cast as the title character in 2006. Waldron expressed interest in the idea, but Cruise was never approached due to his filming schedule for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning (2023) and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (2025).[82] Other rumors about potential cameos included an appearance of Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Wade Wilson / Deadpool from Fox's Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018);[162] Waldron confirmed there had been discussions about bringing Reynolds in to play Deadpool before they decided that the film was not \"the right place\" to feature him.[163] Another character introduced in the film is Clea, with Charlize Theron cast in the role. Waldron said they wanted to include her in the film but felt they needed to resolve Strange's relationship with Christine Palmer first, so the character's introduction was saved for the mid-credits scene to set her up as a potential new love interest in a future story.[41]\n\n| External videos                                                                                                                                                                            | External videos                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness End Credits Main On End Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel | Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness End Credits Main On End Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel |\n\nIndustrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Digital Domain, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Capital T, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Wētā FX, Trixter, Crafty Apes, and Perception worked on the visual effects of the film,[164][165] in which an estimated 2,000 VFX shots were created.[166] Framestore worked on the multiverse jumping sequence with Strange and Chavez, while Luma Pictures worked on the Gargantos fight scene.[164] Perception also designed the film's main-on-end title sequence, which employs colorful Rorschach test visuals because Raimi wanted the sequence to \"both complement and contrast the film\".[167] Animators from Disney worked to create another version of the Walt Disney Productions film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), with a different color palette, for a scene in Multiverse of Madness.[168] Graham Churchyard served as costume designer and created most of the costumes for the film, except for those worn by Black Bolt and Richards, both of which could not be completed in time due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. They were created through visual effects instead.[169] In late August 2022, Waldron revealed that one of the first drafts of the film's script included a post-credits scene involving a seemingly alive Richards, but the idea was scrapped.[170] Another draft of the script included a scene of Strange meeting a variant of himself named Melvin, who would have been depicted as a street magician with no mystical abilities.[168] Gomez noted that Marvel asked for numerous rewrites of the script from Waldron.[171]\n\n## Music\n\nDoctor Strange composer Michael Giacchino was set to return for the sequel by October 2019, when Derrickson was set as director.[172] After Raimi took over, Danny Elfman was hired as composer; Elfman previously worked with Raimi on Darkman (1990), A Simple Plan (1998), Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and Oz the Great and Powerful (2013).[173] By February 2021, Elfman had begun working on music to be used during filming, but would not begin work on the actual score for several months.[173] In January 2022, Elfman said he was completing work on the score,[174] including conducting an orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London.[174][83] Elfman's frequent collaborator Steve Bartek worked on the score remotely over Zoom.[174] A soundtrack album featuring Elfman's score was released digitally by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on May 4,[175] with three \"spoiler tracks\" that were excluded from the initial release being made available on May 20.[176]\n\nElfman referenced Giacchino's Doctor Strange theme in a similar way to how he used Alan Silvestri's theme from The Avengers (2012) when working on Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015).[177] The score also features the song \"WandaVision!\" by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, from the WandaVision episode \"Don't Touch That Dial\", when Wanda is first introduced; Silvestri's \"Captain America March\" theme from Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) for Atwell's Captain Carter appearance;[178] and the main theme from X-Men '97 by the Newton Brothers, which is an updated version of the main theme from X-Men: The Animated Series composed by Ron Wasserman, for the introduction of Xavier. For legal reasons, the latter theme is credited to The Animated Series music executives Haim Saban and Shuki Levy.[178][179]\n\n## Marketing\n\nA teaser trailer for the film was played after the end credits of Spider-Man: No Way Home,[15] before being released online on December 22, 2021.[180] Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine called it a \"rousing, thrilling trailer\" and noted the ending that revealed an alternate version of Strange. He believed this was Doctor Strange Supreme, an alternate version of the character introduced in What If...?.[181] Inverse's Alex Welch felt it was a \"suitably psychedelic teaser, full of revelations and fun moments that should leave Marvel fans gobsmacked\", and suggested the film would tie together \"many of the multiversal threads left hanging\" from No Way Home, WandaVision, and the first seasons of Loki and What If...?.[182] Writing for Decider, Alex Zalben believed the film was a \"direct result\" of What If...?, which \"instantly mak[es] the animated series far more important than Marvel fans might have originally realized\".[183] James Grebey at Syfy Wire said there was \"a very ominous aura to the whole trailer\".[184] Daniel Chin of The Ringer felt the trailer had \"creepy imagery\" and that it was \"expected to separate itself from other Marvel projects even further by weaving in horror elements\", while also noting how the film won't have to introduce the multiverse, and can instead explore it even further, and also how it'll be the \"first real attempt to blend existing story lines from its Disney+ series with its big-screen properties\", while he thought made it the \"first major crossover event in Phase 4\".[185] Also in December, merchandise began to be made available with the reveal of Marvel Legends figures based on the film.[186]\n\nA teaser aired during Super Bowl LVI on February 13, 2022, with the full-length trailer debuting online afterward.[16] Justin Carter at Gizmodo highlighted how the trailer continued the first film's \"visually trippy\" approach to alternate dimensions while adding more horror elements, and was also excited by the brief appearance of America Chavez,[144] while his colleague Germain Lussier felt, compared to the teaser, the trailer \"raised the stakes exponentially with all manner of wild revelations and images\".[187] Entertainment Weekly's Devan Coggan also felt the trailer was \"trippy\" and added that it \"seems to have more in common with Raimi's iconic horror films\".[188] The Verge's Charles Pulliam-Moore said the trailer did a better job conveying the film's plot than the teaser, and he felt the film would be the \"culmination of all the big-picture troubles\" teased in WandaVision and Loki.[189] Many commentators noted the revelation of Patrick Stewart's involvement in the trailer and the implication he could reprise his X-Men role of Charles Xavier / Professor X,[144][16][190][145] which led to speculation that Multiverse of Madness would introduce the MCU version of the Illuminati.[191][192][193][194] RelishMix reported that the trailer had 93.12 million views in 24 hours across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, which was the top trailer among those airing during the Super Bowl according to their metrics. Disney reported 143 million online views across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, and Google searches, and 55 million broadcast views.[195]\n\nFunko Pops based on the film were revealed in March 2022.[196] In April, Procter &amp; Gamble released a commercial promoting the film and Tide laundry detergent featuring Wong and the Cloak of Levitation.[197] Later that month, Disney showcased the opening sequence of the film at CinemaCon.[198] The film also partnered with G Fuel and Xbox, which created custom cobranded console kits and controllers inspired by the film, while also featuring a Jaeger-Le Coultre watch in the film. It also partnered with Mori Building Company, a Japanese urban landscape developer, which turned its café and menu into an interactive photo op experience to promote the film. Additional partnerships included Cadillac, Maybank, Shell US in the Asia–Pacific (APAC) region, and also Xiaomi and T-Mobile in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.[199][200][201][202] Three episodes of the series Marvel Studios: Legends were released on April 29, exploring Doctor Strange, Wong, and Scarlet Witch using footage from their previous MCU appearances.[203] Eight VTubers from Hololive Production promoted the film in a special pre-premiere stream event on YouTube on May 3.[204] Disney spent a total of $150 million promoting the film.[205]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on May 2, 2022.[206][207] The film was released in several countries, including Germany, Italy, Sweden, and South Korea on May 4, 2022, in the United Kingdom on May 5,[208] and in the United States on May 6.[136] It was released in 4DX, RealD 3D, IMAX, Dolby Cinema, ScreenX, and Superscreen formats.[209][210] It was originally set for release on May 7, 2021,[19] but was pushed back to November 5, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[85] before it was further shifted to March 25, 2022, after Sony rescheduled Spider-Man: No Way Home to November 2021.[97] In October 2021, it was shifted once again to its final May 2022 date.[136] The film is part of Phase Four of the MCU.[211]\n\nIn April 2022, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the film would not be released in Saudi Arabia due to the inclusion of America Chavez, a gay character, given the region's censorship of LGBTQ references.[212] Nawaf Alsabhan, Saudi Arabia's general supervisor of cinema classification, said the film had not been banned from the country but revealed that Disney was \"not willing\" to grant their request of cutting \"barely 12 seconds\" of a scene in which Chavez refers to her \"two moms\".[213] The film had been set to release in several Persian Gulf countries on May 5, before advanced tickets were removed from cinema websites in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar. Tickets were still available in the United Arab Emirates, which The Hollywood Reporter stated was an indication that the film could still be released there.[212] IMAX Corporation also confirmed that the film would not be released in Egypt.[214] Cumberbatch was disappointed by the countries' decisions to not release the film, saying: \"We've come to know from those repressive regimes that their lack of tolerance is exclusionary to people who deserve to be not only included, but celebrated for who they are and made to feel part of a society and a culture and not punished for their sexuality. It feels truly out of step with everything that we've experienced as a species, let alone where we're at globally more as a culture, but frankly, it's just even more reason why this isn't tokenism to include an LGBTQ+ community member\".[215] Deadline Hollywood reported in late April that the film was unlikely to be released in China after a newspaper box for The Epoch Times, a newspaper that opposes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was noticed in the film's trailer. It had been submitted for review to Chinese officials by that time.[216] In mid-May, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said the situation was complicated but noted that the film was already commercially successful without a release in China.[217]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film began streaming on Disney+ on June 22, 2022,[218] with the option to view the theatrical version of the film or an IMAX Enhanced version.[219] It was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 26. The home media includes audio commentary, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and various behind-the-scenes featurettes.[220] According to Samba TV, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was watched by 2.1 million U.S. households within its first five days of being available on Disney+; this was comparable to the viewership of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) and Eternals (2021).[221] According to the streaming aggregator JustWatch, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was the sixth most streamed film in the United States in 2022.[222]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness grossed $411.3 million in the United States and Canada and $544.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $955.8 million.[3][4] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2022.[223] Forbes estimated the film made a profit of $127.3 million.[2] The film grossed $42 million in ticket presales through Fandango, and sold the most tickets on the platform since Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), while also surpassing ticket presales for The Batman (2022) within 24 hours.[224][198] Its worldwide opening weekend of $452.4 million was the ninth-largest opening ever, and marked the highest May debut of all-time for IMAX ($33 million).[225]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film grossed $187.4 million in its opening weekend, surpassing the $151 million opening weekend gross of Spider-Man 3 (2007) to become the highest of Sam Raimi's career. It grossed $90.7 million on its opening day, which included $36 million from Thursday previews. The preview was the second-best preview during the pandemic behind Spider-Man: No Way Home and the overall eighth-largest preview performance, while the opening-day gross was the seventh-highest in industry history. The film's $90.7 million opening day tally is also the largest single-day gross in May of all time.[226] In its second weekend, the film grossed $61 million, becoming one of the MCU's biggest second-weekend box office drops. The 67% decline was attributed by Deadline Hollywood to the \"bad word of mouth\" on the film and its CinemaScore grade, while EntTelligence saw more than 17% downsize of available seats for the film, resulting in fewer showtimes which also led to the decline.[227] In its third weekend, the film grossed $31.6 million.[228] The film grossed $17 million in its fourth weekend for a running total of $376.1 million, passing The Batman's $369.3 million to become the highest-grossing film of 2022 (later surpassed by Top Gun: Maverick).[229][230] It ended up being the fourth highest-grossing film of 2022 in this region.[231]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, Multiverse of Madness grossed $265 million from 49 markets within its opening weekend, landing at number one in numerous markets. The film grossed $27.2 million from 20 markets on its opening day, surpassing the first-day overall results of Doctor Strange (2016) by 153% and The Batman by 210%, but falling behind No Way Home by 4%. The film had the highest opening day gross for a film released during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines and Thailand, with $1.2 million in both markets, and the second-best ditto in France ($3 million), Italy ($2.2 million), and Germany ($1.8 million). In Malaysia, the film grossed $1.6 million on its opening day to become the second highest in the country's history. The film grossed $10.3 million from its previews in Latin America, including from Mexico ($3.5 million) and Brazil ($2.7 million).[232] As of June 12, 2022[update], the film's largest markets are the United Kingdom ($51.4 million), South Korea ($49.2 million), Mexico ($40.6 million), Brazil ($33.1 million), and France ($27.7 million).[233]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 74%, with an average score of 6.5/10, based on 465 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness labors under the weight of the sprawling MCU, but Sam Raimi's distinctive direction casts an entertaining spell.\"[234] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 65 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[235] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 82% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 69% saying they would definitely recommend it.[226]\n\nCritics had varied opinions on the film, though many praised Sam Raimi's direction for its distinctive style. Don Kaye of Den of Geek and Owen Gleiberman of Variety both noted Raimi's touch, with Kaye appreciating the comic book weirdness and Gleiberman acknowledging the excessive CGI but enjoying Raimi's flair.[236][237] Similarly, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly found Raimi's direction \"wildly refreshing\", and Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood likened the film's storytelling to Raimi's earlier horror works, such as The Evil Dead.[238][239] However, not all reviews were glowing. David Ehrlich of IndieWire felt that Doctor Strange's character had been diluted and offered a mixed view on Raimi's impact,[240] while Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com criticized the film's characterization and excessive reliance on CGI, labeling it a \"Frankenstein movie\".[134] Similarly, Alonso Duralde of TheWrap compared the film unfavorably to Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), criticizing the writing and lack of character development, though he did appreciate the score and visuals.[241] Overall, while Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness received praise for its unique direction under Raimi and strong performances, particularly from Elizabeth Olsen, the film's heavy reliance on CGI, its plot complexities, and issues with character development left some critics divided.[242][243][244][245]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                               | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                      |

Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange's corpse to Earth-616, where that universe's version of Stephen Strange rescues Chavez from another demon with help from Wong, the Sorcerer Supreme. Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse.\n\n        Recognizing witchcraft runes on the demon, Strange consults Wanda Maximoff but soon realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Wanda believes that taking Chavez's powers and traveling through the multiverse will allow her to reunite with Billy and Tommy, the children she created during her time in Westview. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez, Wanda attacks Kamar-Taj and kills many sorcerers. Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838. Wanda uses the Darkhold to \"dreamwalk\", taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. After a surviving sorceress, Sara, sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dreamwalk, an enraged Wanda forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore, the source of the Darkhold's power, to reestablish the dreamwalk.\n\n        While searching for help, Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838's Sorcerer Supreme, Karl Mordo, and brought before the Illuminati, a group consisting of Mordo, Peggy Carter, Blackagar Boltagon, Maria Rambeau, Reed Richards, and Charles Xavier. They explain that through reckless use of their universe's Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos, Earth-838's Strange triggered a universe-destroying \"incursion\". After defeating Thanos, the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm. Mordo believes that Earth-616's Strange is similarly dangerous, but Wanda reestablishes her dreamwalk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart's body before the Illuminati can pass judgment. She brutally kills all the Illuminati except Mordo, whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 version of Strange's ex-fiancé, Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati.\n\n        Strange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis of the Darkhold, but Wanda appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind and uses her powers to send Strange and Palmer to an incursion-destroyed universe. Strange defeats the destroyed universe's Strange, who has been corrupted by his Darkhold, and then uses that Darkhold to dreamwalk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Wanda and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. Chavez transports Wanda to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy fearfully recoiling from her while crying for their real mother. Realizing her errors, Wanda relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.\n\n        Some time later, Kamar-Taj is under repair and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training. Strange develops a third eye as a result of using the Darkhold and dreamwalking into a corpse. In a mid-credits scene, Strange is approached by a sorceress who warns that his actions have triggered an incursion that he must help repair. Strange follows her into the Dark Dimension.\n    </Plot>\n</DoctorStrangeInTheMultiverseOfMadness>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the key attributes are clearly tagged.

Sometimes in my reviews, I’ll assess a movie purely from an entertainment standpoint. But sometimes, a movie will come along that honestly needs to be looked at closer with both lenses. And Godzilla Vs. Kong, of all things, is actually one of those movies. To be frank, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like this movie. From an entertainment standpoint it’s actually a huge blast! But for a film in a franchise so heavily tied to Japanese roots, and prior to this installment, honored those roots proudly, it honestly gets me a bit angry whenever I think about it. So, with your permission, and because it’s cheaper than therapy, I’d like to use this review to talk about the things I loved about the film from an entertainment standpoint, the things I disliked from an entertainment standpoint, and the things I hated from a cultural standpoint as a fellow Nerd of Color.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo kick things off, Godzilla Vs. Kong takes place a few years after the events of Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It begins when Godzilla, out of nowhere, attacks a facility for a multi-billion dollar corporation called APEX. The CEO of APEX, Walter Simmons (Damien Bichir), in response seeks out Dr. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) and asks him to lead an expedition to the Hollow Earth–a long theorized world at the center of the Earth–to harness a source of energy that APEX is planning to use as a weapon against Godzilla. In order to get to Hollow Earth, however, Lind needs a Titan to escort them through (since Titans originally came from The Hollow Earth), and thus he contacts his former colleague at Monarch, and caregiver for Kong, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle) to see if they can assist him in getting Kong to be that Titan chaperone. However, as legends state, bringing Kong out of Skull Island triggers an ancient rivalry he has with Godzilla–both being apex titans–and before you can say “king of the monsters,” Godzilla comes for Kong.\n\nLet’s start with what I loved. This movie is honestly the most fun I’ve had seeing a film in the past year! You know I love kaiju movies and Godzilla movies in general, and Godzilla Vs. Kong delivers hands down the best action I’ve seen in the MonsterVerse, period. I gushed about how much I loved the action in King of the Monsters, but the fights in this one are clearer, more dynamic, more organic, and all the more brutal. The cinematography is just beautiful too. WB and Legendary deliver on a scale that is just so unheard of, that you will be smiling at every frame put to celluloid. The final battle(s) alone is well worth the price of an IMAX ticket. It’s an exciting, candy-coated colorful delight for your eyes and inner-8-year old! It’s spectacle incarnate!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the action, the other amazing thing about this movie is how it slyly makes Kong the big star. Yes, surprisingly, even though everyone’s favorite radioactive reptile gets top-billing, this movie actually belongs to the great gorilla. I’m a Team Godzilla guy, but Kong is infinitely more sympathetic here, and ends up being my favorite character in the film. All he wants to do is find a home, but whether it’s Godzilla or humanity, something is always stopping him. So you can’t help but feel bad for him and love him, since he’s ultimately the victim in all this. The movie totally understands that its greatest source of heart comes from Kong’s true humanity (for lack of a better term), and his relationship with Jia, a deaf girl who speaks to Kong through sign language, played by an adorable, scene stealing newcomer Kaylee Hottle. Their relationship is sweet, touching, and believable. However the movie also treats him like a complete badass! And, on more than one occasion, Kong saves the day in the most awesome, most brutal ways possible! Furthermore, his entire search for a home, and the subsequent journey to the Hollow Earth is so gorgeous and gonzo, that you can’t help but gleefully smile at the sheer ridiculous imagination this film has. There’s literally a scene of Kong reaching out at a floating rock in zero-gravity that’s surprisingly poetic, highlighting his sense of human wonder within an animal that should be all primal rage and instinct, but really is so much more.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Godzilla sadly doesn’t get explored as a character as deeply in this film as Kong does, but frankly that’s okay since we had King of the Monsters not too long ago. We explored the similar humanity in Godzilla in that movie, so the groundwork was done. It’s the same principle behind not needing to establish who Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America are in the very first Avengers film back in 2012. We accept Godzilla’s character and his motivations because he had two films to earn and establish them, and Godzilla Vs Kong frankly just needs to play off that. And in that regard, surprisingly, the MonsterVerse is actually better established and planned out than many other cinematic universes. We already know who Kong and Godzilla are when they begin their battle. And that sort of makes the stakes a bit higher because we actually do like both characters, and are invested in seeing which one will fall, because we really don’t want either of them to.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhere Godzilla Vs. Kong is less successful than King of the Monsters or Kong Skull Island, however, is the human element. Now I’ve often said that the humans don’t matter much in Godzilla movies, and I do stand by that. Yet many people still complained about the human story in King of the Monsters too. But I argue that at least in that film, I felt the humans were way more useful/necessary in terms of actually helping Godzilla than any of them were here, outside of Jia. In fact, in the entire franchise, I’d argue that this may be the stupidest group of humans from all four MonsterVerse films. For example, there’s a team of characters in this movie, played by really talented actors, that simply serves literally zero purpose other than to travel to Hong Kong to reveal expositional plot points for the audience, then perhaps spill a drink (you’ll know what I mean when you see it. Trust me. It’s dumb.). While one team is doing that, the other team has a bit more of a successful storyline that dives into really crazy sci-fi/fantasy territory that, to a degree, feels completely, tonally different from the previous three gritty/realistic films in this franchise. That second team is a lot more entertaining and engaging, but I found them still making such idiotic choices at times that it becomes hard to take any of them seriously as scientists.\n\nThe tone is also a bit more odd in this one than previous installments. For example, when we look back at Godzilla 2014, the material really treated things as if Godzilla attacking San Francisco was akin to a real-life 9/11-esque disaster. I can say that, for better and worse, Godzilla Vs. Kong completely throws that out the window and fully embraces camp and silliness. And it’s weird and, from a franchise standpoint, seriously inconsistent. So in that regard (the inconsistency specifically) I wasn’t a fan of the abrupt 180-degree shift. And yet, at the same time, odd and weird in this case is also kind of good. This installment doesn’t take itself too seriously, and it really shouldn’t! This is a movie about two kaiju smashing each other and beating each other senseless, so it’s time to let go of the grit and just embrace the fun. Yeah that makes things a lot stupider. But does it really matter as long as I’m entertained? In this case I’ll let inconsistency and intelligence slide, and embrace the goofy, nutty wham-bam of it all like I do with any Fast and Furious movie!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNow, there’s a reason I haven’t gotten to performances yet in this review, and it’s because this aspect of the film really ties heavily into what made me angry about it. As much fun as I did have with the movie, boy, does it really stomp all over its diverse cast in favor of giving the spotlight to White actors, who frankly give aggressively mediocre performances. We’re talking about a cast consisting of Brian Tyree Henry, Eiza González, Shun Oguri, Julian Dennison, and Academy Award-Nominee Demian Bichir. And they’re all wasted.\n\nDo you know what sort of material they’re given? Henry plays a paranoid alcoholic crackpot of no real value in this film other than serving as a ridiculous exposition dump from scene to scene. The movie treats him like a caricature of conspiracy theorist loonies and poorly executed comedic relief that frankly makes him, one of the most charming actors working today, quite unappealing. González and Bichir are reduced to playing such broad 1-dimensional villains that are (spoiler alert) disposed of in ways that are treated like jokes (admittedly, I did laugh at one of those scenes, and groaned at the other). González, herself, who has time and time again proven her acting chops in films like this year’s I Care A Lot and 2017’s Baby Driver, is reduced to saying such stupid lines like “Did the monkey just talk?” Whereas, Bichir, an Oscar nominee, is literally playing a cartoonish villain with ridiculous motivations, written off in a scene that fits in more with Looney Tunes than a real Godzilla movie.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd, don’t get me started on Oguri’s character. Playing the son of Ken Watanabe’s incredible character Ishirō “Let Them Fight” Serizawa (not that this movie bothers to spend any time telling you that he’s Serizawa’s son, mind you), the stand-out character of the past two Godzilla films, Oguri’s character is not only a villain whose philosophies are inexplicably contrary to his father’s, but he literally says maybe five lines in one scene, then spends the rest of the movie “in a trance” plugged in to a giant kaiju skull, before getting electrocuted randomly. It’s an extremely disappointing showing for a Japanese character in a franchise that takes its roots from Japanese culture and has at least attempted to honor that culture in the past two films.\n\nAll of this garbage is given to seasoned actors of color, in favor of passing the spotlight to the generic White characters. Take returning character, Madison Russell, played by Millie Bobby Brown. We spend so much time with Madison doing absolutely nothing. She runs around the world to say some snarky things here and there, gets in trouble, and that’s it. Uh, could none of that screen time have been spent instead establishing a compelling story about Oguri’s Ren Serizawa and a fractured relationship with his kaiju-obsessed father who sacrificed himself trying to save Godzilla and the world? Could they not have discussed something on par with him blaming Godzilla for his father’s death? Apparently not! It is far more important to have Madison Russell talk about tap water with Henry’s paranoid crackpot character. There’s also Alexander Skarsgård, who does have a better role in the film than Brown, since he plays the, once again, White male hero who helps the Titans save Hong Kong from disaster.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd yes, I’ll give credit to the film for making Hottle, an actress of Asian descent, the heart and soul of the film with Kong. But at no point in the movie are we really aware that she’s a character of color. And look, I’m not saying they have to blatantly say she’s Asian and she’s saving the day. But it couldn’t hurt a movie that seems already incredibly keen to treat the other minority characters in it as giant jokes or non-existent entities. My point is, you’re a movie franchise derived from Japanese pop culture. Do better to represent that culture!\n\nWhat makes the film all the worse is that this is the second time we’ve seen a movie by director Adam Wingard adapted from source material rooted in Asian culture being completely white-washed in its entirety. Wingard saw a lot of rage and controversy from the Asian community with his treatment of Death Note for Netflix, which was literally his last project. While I understand the studio has a significant hand at the casting decisions and story than perhaps Wingard himself would have, it really looks as if there was zero accountability or lessons learned from this experience on that previous film four years ago. There could have been further suggestions made to avoid these sorts of representation issues, but alas, this doesn’t appear to have been considered on any significant level, which is a huge shame and a real missed opportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo add further insult to injury, having the movie’s climax set in Hong Kong, while we root for giant monsters and White saviors to come stop the destruction or create more is seriously a bad look this day in age. Because the intent of the film is for audiences to be excited and joyful about seeing the epic showdown between Kong and Godzilla, the movie seems to be 100% okay with us callously not giving a damn about the hundreds of Hong Kong residents getting crushed and killed in the destruction. At least in King of the Monsters, we’re shown the US Government’s efforts to evacuate Boston, where the final showdown between Godzilla and Mothra vs. Rodan and King Ghidorah takes place. The carnage in that film occurs in the relatively uninhabited remains of the city. But here debris is falling from the sky and destroying Asians by the dozen. No one is trying to help or save any of the Asian citizens. But it’s supposed to be all okay because of how cool it looks. Between the previous film and this one, we’re seeing a completely mixed message in my opinion; one that seems to insinuate that the lives of American folks in Boston matter more than the Asian lives in Hong Kong. While I understand it’s not explicitly stated, no efforts are being made to show those lives need to be valued as well. And the intent is literally that we’re not supposed to question any of this, in favor of hooting and hollering at the pretty action on screen.\n\nFurthermore, to even release this film during a time when violence against Asians and Asian Americans is running rampant is, quite frankly, an incredibly tone deaf decision. Did no one think about this? I mean what sort of message are we saying when we release statements saying “We stand against racism and violence against Asians…Now watch this really pretty movie where White people save Hong Kong, and root for giant monsters killing Asian people all over the streets!”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook, I like Godzilla movies. And yes, I had fun with this film on a superficial level. I stand by the idea that it’s the most fun I’ve had turning my brain off for a popcorn movie in 2 years. But one of the things we, at the Nerds of Color, believe is that you can actually like a movie, but still take a lot of issue with how problematic it is. And for every ounce of fun Godzilla Vs. Kong has to offer, there are a LOT of problematic areas that need to be assessed as well. And to that end, I encourage you, our fans and fellow people of color to continue to go out and support this movie. Why? Because we still want more Godzilla movies in the future – especially if the action and spectacle is still fun and worth watching. But I urge you that with every ticket you claim or stream you view, to also tell the studio that they need to do better next time! Do we want to see Godzilla and Kong again? Of course we do. We just also want to see ourselves in these movies in better opportunities than this specific installment afforded us. And we want to see less disregard and double standards regarding the on-screen deaths of people that look like us. God knows we see it in real life enough. We can’t persist in spreading the message that this sort of violence is okay when it comes to people of color. So send our message instead.\n\nGodzilla first debuted in 1954, and times have changed significantly since then. It’s time his films start changing too.\n\nOverall Score (on an entertainment level): B\nOverall Score (on a representation level): D-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Threads (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n- More\n\n- Click to print (Opens in new window)\n- Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\n\n### Like this:\n\n### Related\n\n## 5 thoughts on “NOC Review: ‘Godzilla Vs.

I happened to find your review when searching for reviews of GvK by POC’s to get some added perspective! Admittedly, I had to skim through parts of it to avoid some spoilers mentioned (not ranting or mad!) and I find your take on enjoying a film but acknowledging problematic areas to be really interesting and fascinating because this is something I struggle with as a viewer. Whenever I see that a film has issues with it’s POC characters/casting, I always feel that someway I’m hurting and disrespecting POC viewers if I enjoy a certain film, especially if a POC mentions it in a review or conversation, or if I haven’t seen the film yet I tend to not watch them over said issues. So seeing how you still recommended seeing the film is something that is really interesting to me, and was wondering how you were able to balance noticing and feeling (justifiably) upset over the issues regarding the POC characters, but also still having fun and enjoying watching the film and recommending it? I’m super sorry for the essay, just a big Godzilla film fan, but also someone who wants to make sure that I am not hurting others by the media I watch! I guess I’m still working on being able to do both! I appreciate your review for giving me a perspective to think about when and after I see the film!

Thanks for your thoughtful reply. You absolutely didn’t do anything offensive and you raised a really good question. \nIt can be difficult to isolate sometimes but I strongly feel there are 2 ways to look at a movie: From an entertainment and narrative perspective and from a sociological perspective. \nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying a good movie on an entertainment perspective. A Fast and Furious movie, or Avengers can be loved and enjoyed for fun, spectacle, heart, etc. all depending on character, story, plot, action, etc. And in that regard, the MonsterVerse is pretty high up there. It’s fun. It’s gorgeous. It’s pretty well developed as a franchise. And that is something we need in our lives because sometimes the real world can be difficult to deal with. Escapism and indulging in the fun it brings is necessary to bring some sense of joy in our lives. \nFrom a sociological perspective, there doesn’t always have to be an expectation. I don’t go into Avengers movies expecting deeper commentaries on life and that’s ok. They’re not trying to. And on the whole neither is Godzilla vs Kong. But when you think about the roots of a franchise like Godzilla, they really started in Japanese culture. \nNow for an American studio to adapt it is not only fine, but also encouraged to spread the love and fandom to other cultures, but it needs to be done with a bit of reverence and acknowledgement,  otherwise it’s almost like inferior plagiarism. Or worse, the implied notion that an American company can do something that’s authentically Japanese better than its creators. I felt that reverence to the Japanese influence in the first two WB Godzilla films with Ken Watanabe’s character, but it seems to have been abandoned here. And that’s one of the things that bothered me. The sole allusion to Japanese culture is Shun Oguri’s character and his role is not only minor but pointless. The second allusion to Asian culture (in this case not Japanese but still Asian) is the setting of Hong Kong where much of the damage and chaos ensues. Hundreds of Asians getting killed, which is a point not focused on at all.\nWhen you combine that with the notion that other characters of color are also given little to do, it makes you wonder why. Why were those decisions made? From a narrative or entertainment standpoint any character of any decent could have played Alexander Skarsgaard’s part. Why did it strictly have to be a White male? And that’s the part that’s troublesome. You abandon the reverence to the Japanese roots of the franchise or opportunity to shine the spotlight on other actors of color for nothing. And that is problematic. That’s something studios and filmmakers should consider when making these films. Otherwise it marginalizes or alienates other cultures.\nNow those issues don’t prevent you from enjoying the spectacle of two giant monsters fighting each other. That’s isolated. That part of us prioritizing the entertainment cuz it fills us with joy can and still should enjoy that. Feel the fun. Enjoy it cuz you deserve it. And GVK delivers in that well. It’s almost decoupled from the other parts of the movie that bother me.\nBut consider how this is being seen by millions of people. What sort of message is it spreading and what sort of influence is happening when those viewers see a White male once again saving the day, or the Japanese guy as one of the villains. Or the idea that Asian citizens getting killed is something we can brush off? That’s understated negligence and underlying racism at its core.\nPoint is, it’s completely ok to go into a movie with your brain turned off and come out enjoying it. But once that’s over, think about how there’s still room for growth in the industry and in society.\nHope that makes sense and thanks again for reading and listening.\n\nLoading...\n- Pingback: NOC Interview: ‘Godzilla Vs.

Sometimes in my reviews, I’ll assess a movie purely from an entertainment standpoint. But sometimes, a movie will come along that honestly needs to be looked at closer with both lenses. And <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation>, of all things, is actually one of those movies. To be frank, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like this movie. From an entertainment standpoint it’s actually a huge blast! But for a film in a franchise so heavily tied to Japanese roots, and prior to this installment, honored those roots proudly, it honestly gets me a bit angry whenever I think about it. So, with your permission, and because it’s cheaper than therapy, I’d like to use this review to talk about the things I loved about the film from an entertainment standpoint, the things I disliked from an entertainment standpoint, and the things I hated from a cultural standpoint as a fellow Nerd of Color.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            To kick things off, <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation> takes place a few years after the events of <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</Name></movieRecommendation>. It begins when Godzilla, out of nowhere, attacks a facility for a multi-billion dollar corporation called APEX. The CEO of APEX, Walter Simmons (Damien Bichir), in response seeks out Dr. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) and asks him to lead an expedition to the Hollow Earth–a long theorized world at the center of the Earth–to harness a source of energy that APEX is planning to use as a weapon against Godzilla. In order to get to Hollow Earth, however, Lind needs a Titan to escort them through (since Titans originally came from The Hollow Earth), and thus he contacts his former colleague at Monarch, and caregiver for Kong, Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) and her adopted daughter Jia (Kaylee Hottle) to see if they can assist him in getting Kong to be that Titan chaperone. However, as legends state, bringing Kong out of Skull Island triggers an ancient rivalry he has with Godzilla–both being apex titans–and before you can say “king of the monsters,” Godzilla comes for Kong.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Let’s start with what I loved. This movie is honestly the most fun I’ve had seeing a film in the past year! You know I love kaiju movies and Godzilla movies in general, and <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation> delivers hands down the best action I’ve seen in the MonsterVerse, period. I gushed about how much I loved the action in <movieRecommendation><Name>King of the Monsters</Name></movieRecommendation>, but the fights in this one are clearer, more dynamic, more organic, and all the more brutal. The cinematography is just beautiful too. WB and Legendary deliver on a scale that is just so unheard of, that you will be smiling at every frame put to celluloid. The final battle(s) alone is well worth the price of an IMAX ticket. It’s an exciting, candy-coated colorful delight for your eyes and inner-8-year old! It’s spectacle incarnate!\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            In addition to the action, the other amazing thing about this movie is how it slyly makes Kong the big star. Yes, surprisingly, even though everyone’s favorite radioactive reptile gets top-billing, this movie actually belongs to the great gorilla. I’m a Team Godzilla guy, but Kong is infinitely more sympathetic here, and ends up being my favorite character in the film. All he wants to do is find a home, but whether it’s Godzilla or humanity, something is always stopping him. So you can’t help but feel bad for him and love him, since he’s ultimately the victim in all this. The movie totally understands that its greatest source of heart comes from Kong’s true humanity (for lack of a better term), and his relationship with Jia, a deaf girl who speaks to Kong through sign language, played by an adorable, scene stealing newcomer Kaylee Hottle. Their relationship is sweet, touching, and believable. However the movie also treats him like a complete badass! And, on more than one occasion, Kong saves the day in the most awesome, most brutal ways possible! Furthermore, his entire search for a home, and the subsequent journey to the Hollow Earth is so gorgeous and gonzo, that you can’t help but gleefully smile at the sheer ridiculous imagination this film has. There’s literally a scene of Kong reaching out at a floating rock in zero-gravity that’s surprisingly poetic, highlighting his sense of human wonder within an animal that should be all primal rage and instinct, but really is so much more.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            On the other side of the coin, Godzilla sadly doesn’t get explored as a character as deeply in this film as Kong does, but frankly that’s okay since we had <movieRecommendation><Name>King of the Monsters</Name></movieRecommendation> not too long ago. We explored the similar humanity in Godzilla in that movie, so the groundwork was done. It’s the same principle behind not needing to establish who Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America are in the very first Avengers film back in 2012. We accept Godzilla’s character and his motivations because he had two films to earn and establish them, and <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation> frankly just needs to play off that. And in that regard, surprisingly, the MonsterVerse is actually better established and planned out than many other cinematic universes. We already know who Kong and Godzilla are when they begin their battle. And that sort of makes the stakes a bit higher because we actually do like both characters, and are invested in seeing which one will fall, because we really don’t want either of them to.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Where <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation> is less successful than <movieRecommendation><Name>King of the Monsters</Name></movieRecommendation> or <movieRecommendation><Name>Kong Skull Island</Name></movieRecommendation>, however, is the human element. Now I’ve often said that the humans don’t matter much in Godzilla movies, and I do stand by that. Yet many people still complained about the human story in <movieRecommendation><Name>King of the Monsters</Name></movieRecommendation> too. But I argue that at least in that film, I felt the humans were way more useful/necessary in terms of actually helping Godzilla than any of them were here, outside of Jia. In fact, in the entire franchise, I’d argue that this may be the stupidest group of humans from all four MonsterVerse films. For example, there’s a team of characters in this movie, played by really talented actors, that simply serves literally zero purpose other than to travel to Hong Kong to reveal expositional plot points for the audience, then perhaps spill a drink (you’ll know what I mean when you see it. Trust me. It’s dumb.). While one team is doing that, the other team has a bit more of a successful storyline that dives into really crazy sci-fi/fantasy territory that, to a degree, feels completely, tonally different from the previous three gritty/realistic films in this franchise. That second team is a lot more entertaining and engaging, but I found them still making such idiotic choices at times that it becomes hard to take any of them seriously as scientists.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            The tone is also a bit more odd in this one than previous installments. For example, when we look back at <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla 2014</Name></movieRecommendation>, the material really treated things as if Godzilla attacking San Francisco was akin to a real-life 9/11-esque disaster. I can say that, for better and worse, <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation> completely throws that out the window and fully embraces camp and silliness. And it’s weird and, from a franchise standpoint, seriously inconsistent. So in that regard (the inconsistency specifically) I wasn’t a fan of the abrupt 180-degree shift. And yet, at the same time, odd and weird in this case is also kind of good. This installment doesn’t take itself too seriously, and it really shouldn’t! This is a movie about two kaiju smashing each other and beating each other senseless, so it’s time to let go of the grit and just embrace the fun. Yeah that makes things a lot stupider. But does it really matter as long as I’m entertained? In this case I’ll let inconsistency and intelligence slide, and embrace the goofy, nutty wham-bam of it all like I do with any Fast and Furious movie!\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Now, there’s a reason I haven’t gotten to performances yet in this review, and it’s because this aspect of the film really ties heavily into what made me angry about it. As much fun as I did have with the movie, boy, does it really stomp all over its diverse cast in favor of giving the spotlight to White actors, who frankly give aggressively mediocre performances. We’re talking about a cast consisting of Brian Tyree Henry, Eiza González, Shun Oguri, Julian Dennison, and Academy Award-Nominee Demian Bichir. And they’re all wasted.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Do you know what sort of material they’re given? Henry plays a paranoid alcoholic crackpot of no real value in this film other than serving as a ridiculous exposition dump from scene to scene. The movie treats him like a caricature of conspiracy theorist loonies and poorly executed comedic relief that frankly makes him, one of the most charming actors working today, quite unappealing. González and Bichir are reduced to playing such broad 1-dimensional villains that are (spoiler alert) disposed of in ways that are treated like jokes (admittedly, I did laugh at one of those scenes, and groaned at the other). González, herself, who has time and time again proven her acting chops in films like this year’s I Care A Lot and 2017’s Baby Driver, is reduced to saying such stupid lines like “Did the monkey just talk?” Whereas, Bichir, an Oscar nominee, is literally playing a cartoonish villain with ridiculous motivations, written off in a scene that fits in more with Looney Tunes than a real Godzilla movie.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            And, don’t get me started on Oguri’s character. Playing the son of Ken Watanabe’s incredible character Ishirō “Let Them Fight” Serizawa (not that this movie bothers to spend any time telling you that he’s Serizawa’s son, mind you), the stand-out character of the past two Godzilla films, Oguri’s character is not only a villain whose philosophies are inexplicably contrary to his father’s, but he literally says maybe five lines in one scene, then spends the rest of the movie “in a trance” plugged in to a giant kaiju skull, before getting electrocuted randomly. It’s an extremely disappointing showing for a Japanese character in a franchise that takes its roots from Japanese culture and has at least attempted to honor that culture in the past two films.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            All of this garbage is given to seasoned actors of color, in favor of passing the spotlight to the generic White characters. Take returning character, Madison Russell, played by Millie Bobby Brown. We spend so much time with Madison doing absolutely nothing. She runs around the world to say some snarky things here and there, gets in trouble, and that’s it. Uh, could none of that screen time have been spent instead establishing a compelling story about Oguri’s Ren Serizawa and a fractured relationship with his kaiju-obsessed father who sacrificed himself trying to save Godzilla and the world? Could they not have discussed something on par with him blaming Godzilla for his father’s death? Apparently not! It is far more important to have Madison Russell talk about tap water with Henry’s paranoid crackpot character. There’s also Alexander Skarsgård, who does have a better role in the film than Brown, since he plays the, once again, White male hero who helps the Titans save Hong Kong from disaster.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            And yes, I’ll give credit to the film for making Hottle, an actress of Asian descent, the heart and soul of the film with Kong. But at no point in the movie are we really aware that she’s a character of color. And look, I’m not saying they have to blatantly say she’s Asian and she’s saving the day. But it couldn’t hurt a movie that seems already incredibly keen to treat the other minority characters in it as giant jokes or non-existent entities. My point is, you’re a movie franchise derived from Japanese pop culture. Do better to represent that culture!\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            What makes the film all the worse is that this is the second time we’ve seen a movie by director Adam Wingard adapted from source material rooted in Asian culture being completely white-washed in its entirety. Wingard saw a lot of rage and controversy from the Asian community with his treatment of <movieRecommendation><Name>Death Note</Name></movieRecommendation> for Netflix, which was literally his last project. While I understand the studio has a significant hand at the casting decisions and story than perhaps Wingard himself would have, it really looks as if there was zero accountability or lessons learned from this experience on that previous film four years ago. There could have been further suggestions made to avoid these sorts of representation issues, but alas, this doesn’t appear to have been considered on any significant level, which is a huge shame and a real missed opportunity.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            To add further insult to injury, having the movie’s climax set in Hong Kong, while we root for giant monsters and White saviors to come stop the destruction or create more is seriously a bad look this day in age. Because the intent of the film is for audiences to be excited and joyful about seeing the epic showdown between Kong and Godzilla, the movie seems to be 100% okay with us callously not giving a damn about the hundreds of Hong Kong residents getting crushed and killed in the destruction. At least in <movieRecommendation><Name>King of the Monsters</Name></movieRecommendation>, we’re shown the US Government’s efforts to evacuate Boston, where the final showdown between Godzilla and Mothra vs. Rodan and King Ghidorah takes place. The carnage in that film occurs in the relatively uninhabited remains of the city. But here debris is falling from the sky and destroying Asians by the dozen. No one is trying to help or save any of the Asian citizens. But it’s supposed to be all okay because of how cool it looks. Between the previous film and this one, we’re seeing a completely mixed message in my opinion; one that seems to insinuate that the lives of American folks in Boston matter more than the Asian lives in Hong Kong. While I understand it’s not explicitly stated, no efforts are being made to show those lives need to be valued as well. And the intent is literally that we’re not supposed to question any of this, in favor of hooting and hollering at the pretty action on screen.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Furthermore, to even release this film during a time when violence against Asians and Asian Americans is running rampant is, quite frankly, an incredibly tone deaf decision. Did no one think about this? I mean what sort of message are we saying when we release statements saying “We stand against racism and violence against Asians…Now watch this really pretty movie where White people save Hong Kong, and root for giant monsters killing Asian people all over the streets!”\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Look, I like Godzilla movies. And yes, I had fun with this film on a superficial level. I stand by the idea that it’s the most fun I’ve had turning my brain off for a popcorn movie in 2 years. But one of the things we, at the Nerds of Color, believe is that you can actually like a movie, but still take a lot of issue with how problematic it is. And for every ounce of fun <movieRecommendation><Name>Godzilla Vs. Kong</Name></movieRecommendation> has to offer, there are a LOT of problematic areas that need to be assessed as well. And to that end, I encourage you, our fans and fellow people of color to continue to go out and support this movie. Why? Because we still want more Godzilla movies in the future – especially if the action and spectacle is still fun and worth watching. But I urge you that with every ticket you claim or stream you view, to also tell the studio that they need to do better next time! Do we want to see Godzilla and Kong again? Of course we do. We just also want to see ourselves in these movies in better opportunities than this specific installment afforded us. And we want to see less disregard and double standards regarding the on-screen deaths of people that look like us. God knows we see it in real life enough. We can’t persist in spreading the message that this sort of violence is okay when it comes to people of color. So send our message instead.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Godzilla first debuted in 1954, and times have changed significantly since then.

We enjoyed the 'butler' robot very much with his sarcastic remarks bringing humour to the film and tied nicely with his master's equally dry sense of humour. \n\nI really wish I could rate it higher because we were left saying 'that wasn't bad' when the credits rolled but honestly I can barely remember the storyline it was shifting so rapidly. \n\nHopefully the next Transformers instalment will carry a little more weight in terms of storyline and pacing to support it's awesome CGI elements and give the film a better shape overall.\n\n- MikeOzen\n- Jul 25, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### fancy visual effet as usual, horrible ridiculous pilot, fragment shot\n\nLike all the other sequence, the visual effect is good, which is of course expected. However, the splendid visual effect cannot save an unreasonable screenplay with particularly fragmental shots and scenes.\n\nThere are countless flaws in the plots and poorly actings:\n1. the self-righteous scientists, their smug parts have 0 contributions to the movie. \n2. Cade, what's wrong with Mark Wahlberg? First time acting? Especially his tone is NOT convincing at all. He really needs to work on his facial expressions and tones. (or perhaps his shots are so fragmental? )\n3. the car chasing part in London city is to make audience excited or dizzy/faint? \n...\n\nAfter 30 minutes, all i want is to skip to the end. \n\nThe last straw that makes the whole movie doomed is Optimus' line: earth is my home.\nThere is no need spending 150 mins on this movie.\n\n- toddcha\n- Feb 19, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### All spectacle\n\n- Leofwine\\_draca\n- Aug 30, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Michael Bay's checklist to make bad movies\n\n1. Every movie must be 3hrs long, keep adding secondary characters until you get there.\n\n2. Have a pointless love interest with no chemistry.\n\n3. Have fight scenes pop up out of nowhere just to show off special effects.\n\n4. Pay a famous actor to do what amounts to an extended cameo, no matter how forced.\n\n5. Introduce stereotypical, secondary characters that were popular in the 80's, the cute kid and the comedic relief, black guy\n\n6. Have heroic deaths, where each hero gets to give a speech as they die in the arms of their best friend. Play epic music just in case we don't understand the moment.\n\n7. Even after 3hrs, leave the audience confused about the plot and behavior of main characters. What was up w/Optimus Prime was he a redeemed bad guy or a restored good guy, why the mood swings?\n\n8. Have the main villain who was indestructible at the start of the movie, badly lose the last fight of the movie.\n\nI felt bad for Laura Haddock, she could have served a purpose other then 'love interest' had they combined her role with Hopkins, and dropped Hopkins. This would have shortened the movie by 30 minutes (oh yeah, rule #1). But instead they gave her a trite role, 'the scholar who was the ONLY one who could FIND the artifact only to hand it over to Wahlberg the ONLY one who could USE it)\n\n- chris-j-chuba\n- Jun 23, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Not impressed\n\nThe best part of this movie is the action, the story was very lack luster. I think it had potential with a good cast including Anthony Hopkins, but the writting always falls short in these movies. You can watch it over and over for the action, you just might scratch your head at certain spots.\n\n- 0U\n- Feb 22, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Not as good as the first, but still a must-see compared to Age of Extinction.\n\n- EatThatPie\n- Jun 19, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Only this franchise could take something as inherently exciting as giant robots fighting and make it utterly dull.\n\nDespite all its spectacle, 'Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)' is simply completely mind-and-arse-numbingly boring. It's an utter chore to sit through from beginning to long-awaited end. It's also the kind of self-indulgent trite that goes in one ear and straight out of the other. Honestly, I felt as though I'd been sat in the cinema for years, never mind the already far too long two-and-a-half hours I actually had to endure this for. Not a single frame provided even a morsel of entertainment - which is weird because, for all intents and purposes, the admittedly impressive visual effects should've at least granted me some brief form of passive enjoyment during one of the over-blown action set-pieces. Yet, the takeaway I have from the picture is this: only Michael Bay (and his team, of course) could make something as inherently exciting as giant robots battling one another so painfully and utterly dull. 3/10.\n\n- Pjtaylor-96-138044\n- May 7, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### My First Ever Review\n\nI actually liked this movie it's far far better than the previous one , i don't know why it's getting bad reviews, i liked the movie , the story line was good , camera work awesome , 3d very impressive , even though it's a lengthy movie i did not get bored , i would love to see more transformers movies like this , do give it a watch\n\n- sulimcool1\n- Sep 26, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Michael Bay toppes himself\n\nThis is unwatchable and so bizarre. I mean Merlin and king Arthur in Transformers movie????\n\n- alansabljakovic-39044\n- Dec 28, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### I  liked this one. For what it was it was entertaining.\n\nNot bad at all.\n\nWhat is it about the odd numbered ones in this franchise that are my favorite? The first Transformers movie was OK. The Third one was my favorite (Which is not saying much). This fifth and last one is up there with the third one.\n\nLike the third one, it was an excellent use of CGI to do the action scenes. Transformers was one of the first movies that I've seen in which they did CGI scenes in the day time, and it looked really good. You can see that director Michael Bay has hit his peak in really making the CGI action interact well with the live action footage.\n\nLike the original movie, The Last Knight is an ensemble cast that revolves around the main character. It's not the best ensemble cast I've seen. Josh Duhamel, who had been in the series longer than Wahlberg felt like a strange insert done for pure nostalgia, but if you are into the Franchise or Transformers in general the ensemble cast gives you that fandom.\n\nSpeaking of Wahlberg, his Cade Yeager is a much better character than Shia LaBeouf's, Sam Witwicky. I like the way Cade gets into the action more than Sam trying to get away from it. It makes for better interaction between the live action and CGI. Bay treats Wahlberg like a walking action figure.\n\nIt is weird how little action is actually in this movie. You have a few giant battles leading up to the epic one at the end, and in-between it's Micheal Bay pretending to be the filmmaker he's not with funny scenes that are not really funny and his attempts to poke fun at Romance scenes in films only made his film stupid. Stick to the slick action and crap blowing up Bay.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the film. Not one of my favorite franchises but I did like this one. It's like watching a live action cartoon, but that's all the Transformers movies isn't it? Thought this one seems to be the best cartoon out of them all.\n\nOK http://cinemagardens.com\n\n- subxerogravity\n- Jun 20, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Pray let this be the last\n\nJust for the record, before those defending the film jump down my throat and start accusing me of all kinds of unfounded things like they have done with their tiresome, uncalled for and disgustingly condescending critic bashing, this review is not coming from a 'Transformers' detractor. Far from it actually oddly enough.\n\nMost of the animated show are really entertaining and well made, and the animated film likewise in a guilty pleasure sort of way. Of the live-action films, the first was enjoyable, 'Revenge of the Fallen' (often considered the worst) for me wasn't that terrible but had a lot wrong with it while 'Dark of the Moon' and 'Age of Extinction' were mediocre. This is coming from somebody with a diverse taste in film and television (and a huge fan of classical music and opera), loving films of all genres old and new.\n\nAm honestly of the opinion that Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise got worse with each instalment, and having seen some describe 'The Last Knight' as the worst of the five having seen for myself with an open mind but with a little knowledge of its reception personally am in agreement. By all means, 'The Last Knight' is not irredeemably bad, none of the 'Transformers' films are. As usual the special effects are mostly of an awesome standard and the Transformers themselves are very well voiced, particularly a note-perfect Peter Cullen and Frank Welker.\n\nBringing some welcome gravitas and fun to the film is Anthony Hopkins in one of the better performances of all five films put together. The best character is the refreshingly witty Cogman, performed with sleek enthusiasm by Jim Carter.\n\nHowever, Bay's direction is smug and self-indulgent and while there is some audacious stylishness to some of the cinematography too much of the editing is enough to make one get a headache. The Transformers don't have enough to do and while well voiced their personalities have been better defined before and their scenes lack tension, fun, excitement or any kind of intrigue. While the action sequences worked in the first three films, they didn't here and 'Age of Extinction', especially here, being chaotic and dull in rhythm. Aside from them being so poorly edited that it was confusing making out what was going on and to the point it was seizure-inducing, they got increasingly repetitive and dull. So instead of feeling thrilled the only feeling I got was boredom, and that was true of a lot of the audience in the cinema.\n\nNone of the human characters are interesting, some are wasted and some are pointless (such as Izabella and Sqweeks). Others are annoying, of all the characters in the entire film faring worst in this regard is the complete failure of a comic relief character in Jimmy, annoyingly played by Jerrod Carmichael. Once again the script is very poor, which has the subtlety of a sledgehammer (even for a live-action 'Transformers' film where subtlety was never a strong suit and wasn't expected, but this was nauseating overkill too often) and is laden with tiresome clichés and cheap lowbrow humour that is on 'Age of Extinction' level and makes that of 'Revenge of the Fallen' comparatively tame.\n\n'The Last Knight' is again overlong by an hour, with the basic story being very thin on the ground and both rushed and slow moving. To make up for this, or disguise it more like, a lot of subplots are added, far too many and many of them are unsatisfyingly resolved or explored or serve no point at all, all giving an over-stuffed feel. Hopkins aside, the acting for the human characters is really not good, with Mark Whalberg being wooden and unconvincing at being tough and Laura Haddock is completely out of her depth. The two generate zero chemistry throughout. Even John Tuturro, Stanley Tucci and Mitch Pileggi are lacklustre.\n\nIn conclusion, weak film and gives the sense that the 'Transformers' franchise has run its course. 3/10 Bethany Cox\n\n- TheLittleSongbird\n- Jun 30, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Absolutely terrible but also fantastic.\n\nWe've got to the point where no one expects anything good from any of these Transformer movies, and this one is no different. It has a confusing, pointless plot with heaps of holes, shocking acting, and unlikable characters. \n\nHowever, I didn't watch this movie with the intention of being a critic; I watched this movie one afternoon when I felt like watching a crappy action movie with robots, explosions, and the occasional fart joke. And in that sense, the movie nails it. I had no idea what was going on the whole way through but I'd be damned if I didn't love every minute of it. Mark Wahlberg's acting is disappointingly terrible and that's awesome, and the editing is absolute chaos. It was perfect.\n\n- sammas-nz\n- Oct 29, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Pardon The Interruption: A Bayhem Apologysts\n\nLook, let's all agree from the outset that Transformers -- as a concept -- is absolutely asinine. It's a race of advanced alien super machines disturbingly taking on traits of human behavior and cultural affectation whilst mostly rolling around in the guise of various performance vehicles fawned over by philistines. There's no rationale where this isn't a mind-numbing conceit born from a toy line aimed at the aggressive fantasy synapses of immature brains. And that's a perfect sandbox for Michael Bay to build his arena and wallow with gluttonous abandon.\n\nSo now that that's established, let me declare the main thesis point for advocacy here: He's a genius! That's right -- Michael Bay is a genius!\n\nBecause Bay is one of the few commonly known filmmakers in the zeitgeist, certain glib hipster constituencies lazily feign credibility in cinematic knowledge by dropping his name in loathing as a pathetic synonym shortcut for superiority though snark. In deed, any faint praise toward Bay is often immediately shot down with hyperbolic aghast and equated to justifying Hitler by his work as a painter, or musing on the songwriting merit of Charles Manson. Now I won't dispute that Bay has an inclination for silly sophomoric humor and vapid glamorization of excess. Nor will I gloss over his propensity to indulge in stereotypes and cliché. One may not be simpatico to his fetishizations, but it's sort of pointless to criticize the very essence of the art form, especially when it's done with such gusto. At lest Bay seems to have a knowing wryness that can take a joke at expense of his brash reputation. As an artist working in the medium of moving visuals, Michael Bay is nothing short of brilliant. If he plays to the lowest common denominator, that denominator in nonetheless true to a passionate perspective set by him. These raucous boyhood reveries aren't just mercenary exploits, but expressions of what Bay truly loves and wants to revisit. Intimately personal to a singular psyche, these are massive experimental art films that happen to align with commerce as their principled dogma. If nothing else, being cognizant that what you're getting is being given with a verisimilitude that absolutely attends to the authentic aura of its own axiom, ought to eek some appreciation -- however begrudging. Just because Bay makes movies with the sensibilities of a thirteen-year-old boy, doesn't mean he ought to be demonized as though guilty of atrocities.\n\nIt's fairly true that Bay's spectacular extravaganzas cater to simpletons, but the dense amount of information breathlessly presented through pure cinematic terms within them is anything but simple. The fact that most of the breakneck exposition being blasted at an audience actually sticks, is proof that Bay is profoundly competent beyond eye-popping exhilarations. It should be noted that before his feature debut with \"Bad Boys\", Michael Bay was already one of the most sought after and acclaimed commercial directors of all time, having amassed an astounding amount of advertising awards for his ability to pack viscerally entertaining stories into thirty-second to a minute-and-a-half short form films.\n\nUnlike the majority of filmmakers credited on complicated productions of vast proportion, Bay (quite uniquely) doesn't shirk responsibilities off to 2nd-Unit crews and department heads to autonomously realize aspects or sequences, but rather personally micromanages all divisions to his specified fruition. With a wicked efficiency in speed and breadth, Bay generals hugely intricate on- set sequences involving simultaneous camera setups of stunning aesthetic composition involving impressive precision in kinetics, frame- rates, lighting, lens augmentations, stunt work and practical effects rigging -- with actors performing in frame – and orchestrates all this \"Bayhem\" safely. Then without missing a beat carries that energy over to lording over every minute aspect of post-production; from the incredibly layered complexities of editing, effects, sound design, music, and even marketing. Bay is no gun-for-hire hack, he is a specific visionary of immense skill set. Although some may be bewildered by the styled nature of its non-stop sensory bombardment -- and regardless as to its vulgar pronouncement, no one can claim it's not often astonishingly beautiful and does somehow express a cohesive whole. That's an extraordinary exhaustive task that only a handful of the most adept and composed directors in the world could even dare attempt, which Bay confidently mounts on a frequent basis, to a degree perhaps unequaled. \n\nThere is a reason why the often emulated, never replication, bigger than life spectacle that Bay routinely accomplishes has garnered proper recognition, accolade, and defense over the years from peers such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, Edgar Wright, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Quentin Tarantino; Because they know that action and montage is the purest form of cinema and Michael Bay is a master of that discipline -- and the fact that it seems so undisciplined is maybe even a testament too. Also they understand the overwhelming workload required to definitively command such gargantuan ventures, and the fact that Bay does it time and again with virtuoso vision of auteur aesthetic is a totally impressive feat -- even if you don't care for it.\n\nOpposing the consensus dismissal that Bay is an unsophisticated abomination that merely makes incoherent populace bombasts that lack any semblance of subtly or nuance in pensive development -- I would counter that perhaps the purveyors of that notion simply lack capacity in comprehending communication through super sophisticated rapid sensorial stimulation. Bay may be stuck in arrested development in his childish proclivities, but that child is nonetheless a supreme savant in cinematic verse.\n\nAs for \"Transformers: The Last Knight\", it has the same expected virtues I've detailed as well as those defects of being excessively loud and shallow. Sure, I'd prefer Bay tone down the bro banter, silly stoicism, and frenetic editing – but such criticisms can only go so deep when what is presented is so staggeringly authentic to its aspiration. Anyway, Anthony Hopkins seems to be having a helluva time!\n\n- octagonproplex\n- Jun 23, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Stop\n\nBoring pointless rubbish, just don't bother it's bad\n\n- andrewjoy-75878\n- Mar 6, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### \"Transformers: The Last Knight\" Is Worse Than \"Age Of Extinction!\"\n\n- TheJediWay9\n- Jun 21, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### It's the fifth film, you know what you're getting by now.\n\nI rarely write reviews, but I'm actually surprised about how harshly this is getting bashed. Well, I'm not *that* surprised. All the Transformer films get eviscerated by critics. So I don't put much stock in reviews. All I'll say is; it's more of the same. If you like the previous 4 films, you'll like this one. I enjoy them all for what they are; cheesy popcorn movies. I personally think this film improves on Age of Extinction. Both Mark Wahlberg and Laura Haddock's characters had equally important roles. Unlike the first three films where Sam was always \"The Chosen One\" and his girlfriend's job was to just run in slow motion yelling \"SAAAAAM!\". The main group of Decepticons were actually given personalities and unique identities. Though completely under- utilized. They make a big deal of giving them Suicide Squad-like introductions and their screen time amounts to maybe 45 seconds each. I was actually surprised how much screen time Anthony Hopkins had. I figured he'd slum it for two or three scenes, of exposition, grab his paycheck then disappear. But he's actually a prominent character and he seemed to have a lot of fun in the role.\n\nI really don't have much else to say. As stated above, it's the fifth film, you've already made up your mind whether you want to see it or not. If the negative reviews have put you on the fence or dissuaded you, think about whether or not you enjoyed the last four films. If yes, then ignore the critics and enjoy yourself.\n\n- briangcb\n- Jun 24, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### How to Enjoy Transformers\n\n- seawolfvii\n- Jun 23, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### If only Age of Extinction ended with extinction so no one had to suffer this mess!\n\n- pixiekatten\n- Aug 5, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Popcorn Movies will never satisfy the critics!\n\n- a649538729\n- Jun 22, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Don't waste your time\n\nThe worst piece of dirt this year so far. No logic, no plot, no story, but with Anthony Hopkins. Why did Anthony participated in this dirt ball mind crap, I don't know but it is not enough. This movie is empty, it is a 2 hours long advertisement of various car manufacturers and American military. Worst Transformers ever, please let this garbage just die and don't bother us with actors who just can not save this movie. It was just awful to watch, I couldn't believe the low quality dialogues and just the waste of money for junk CGI no one really cares about. But why did Mr. Hopkins lower himself to participate in this charade of a movie is beyond me.\n\nWORST MOVIE 2017\n\n- alppein\n- Jul 31, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Quantity over quality\n\nThe Transformers franchise is one of the rare bad movie franchise that continues to entertain and made a lot of cash. They are a type of movie where you throw your brain out of the window, be entertained and have some fun. The trailer for the fifth Transformer movie did give us the impression that this movie might be good, but is it really what the trailer show us?\n\nWell, I've got the answer: It's both a very entertaining movie and a huge mess. This movie, in a typical Michael Bay fashion, is a very entertaining ride from start to finish, which is also a poorly constructed pieces of awesomeness that the movie itself cannot show it's potential to be a good movie (despite being the one with the most potential to be a good movie!)\n\nPros: The story is the most creative and the most entertaining out of the five. Idk why but this is the most \"fun\" Transformer story so far.\n\nMark Wahlberg is fine. Not great, just fine. Stanley Tucci, although brief, brings a good performance as Merlin. Laura Haddock who plays Vivian the professor, and Isabella Moner as (the lazily named) Izabella, both being the latest to be \"Michael Bay-fied\" also gives a good performance, in particular Isabella Moner. Anthony Hopkins is way to good for this movie, and he's one of the bright spots in this movie.\n\nFor the action scenes... You don't need a review for this (because it's Michael friggin Bay.) The visuals are amazing as usual, although there's nothing new to be seen. The cinematography is just fine. The Third Act is a mind-blowing, over the top action that will (obviously) blew your mind. The small cameo by Nicola Peltz and Shia LaBeouf is also well executed.\n\nThe post end credits scene (yes, there is one) is well executed (I guess), and the fact that the long typical​ styled​ credits is replaced by appear/disappear credits (that it's only purpose is to match the end of the song to the end of the credits) is a nice touch as well. \n\nCons: Despite being the most \"fun\" Transformer story, it is also a mess. The story is so convoluted that it's very hard to follow. There's so many plot holes, I mean a lot of plot holes that makes the movie less exciting. The first and the second act was so rushed and it felt like a large portion of the story there was missing. I can bet that there's a large portion of deleted scenes removed from there.\n\nKen Nolan, despite I have high hopes for you for the screenplay, but you're not as good as the other Nolan. The screenplay is littered by very bad and cheesy one liners and despite trying to be funny, it just don't land. Not to mention some awful characterization: Isabella Moner's character is just someone in the wrong place and in the wrong time, she's just there. The inventor guy is so annoying. Josh Duhamel as Lennox from the first three movies is, I don't know, \"useless\". Like Isabella Moner's character, he's just there. John Tuturro's Seymour Simmons is for me can be removed from the movie and made this movie 5 minutes shorter.\n\nDespite being the shortest of the entire franchise, it feels like the longest. Also in the credits I see around 6-7 editors for the movie, but the movie is poorly edited, a downgrade from the previous installment (what the hell are you doing editors?!). When introducing the Deceptions, they went for the \"Suicide Squad\" style introduction, which is very unnecessary. I hate the constant change of aspect ratio in standard theaters. Does it even necessary to \"force you to watch in IMAX 3D to see more\"?. Also, is it just me, or the editors were lazy enough so that when they introducing the locations, they use the exact same font and effect from a better Michael Bay film: \"13 Hours: Secret Soldiers of Benghazi\".\n\nOverall this movie is both a entertaining, no brainier fun, but with over convoluted plot and bad editing, makes this movie not as entertaining as the previous installments. If you want some over the top, out of this world action scenes, go watch this movie and have some fun, otherwise don't watch this movie because it's definitely not for you. Just don't forget to bring some popcorns and drinks because it's going be a very long ride.\n\nFinal Score: 7/10 for action sequences, explosions and more explosions.\n\nOn a side note: Michael Bay, should you ever direct another Transformers movie, can you please prioritize story over visuals, cause I think that is the biggest flaw in every Transformer movie. Thank you.\n\n- Darryl\\_Lazakar01\n- Jun 23, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### A movie out of even common sense\n\nThe movie is made by a teenage writer who cannot even write conversations natural, read part of DaVinci Code, part of Arthur, and watched a Star War movie. Putting everything together without logic, this is what the movie is. Oh, by the way, his knowledge about physics never go beyond what his parents told him in kindergarten.\n\nThere are more than enough critics on plot and poorly told stories; I'm not going to repeat. But I have to point one character: the Old Man. Who cares what his name is (I didn't get it AT ALL) I don't know what kind of personality Michael Bay want to create. What I saw was a rude, uneducated, changing man with a lot of money. It was so awkward while he dump the famous names into my ears and declared that all those people tried to keep that stupid secret. I don't know what he said \"I can't go with you\" because he eventually was there, and...just died there.\n\nAfter 10 min, the only though I had was to see how bad the movie can be. YKW, it's just worse than I thought.\n\n- omegafleons12\n- Sep 28, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### So Much Fun\n\nThis movie is outstanding. You know how when you are a kid you and your brother throw over the toy bin and pull out dinosaurs, knights, tanks, submarines, Lamborghinis, Transformers, GI Joe, Voltron, some LEGO vehicles that can be disassembled and reassembled and a few Star Wars space ships? Maybe your sister wants to play so somehow a Barbie ends up in the mix. Then you have an absolutely epic battle with Knights fighting space ships and LEGOs transforming on the spot to whatever you want. Toys switch back and forth and fight for whoever is holding them. Complete insanity ensues. The story makes no sense because it can't but the battle is truly epic. Your brother grabs a chair and declares its his planet and throws it at your toys so you throw the couch at his. Finally your mom comes in and sends everyone outside, so you leave every toy out and all the furniture turned over to clean up later. Maybe your sister declares that Barbie just did something. That is this movie! It has absolutely everything and makes about as much sense as it can considering. This movie truly channeled second grade for me. I had so much fun and I cannot wait to go back! Definitely watch in 3D and try to watch in IMAX if it is available. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD.\n\n- bertkyle\n- Jun 29, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Definitely not the best Transformers, but still worthy if u enjoy good special effects\n\nWell as a sequel to Transformers movie, this one was having not so many Transformers. It had the same ingredients of the previous movies where a lead character would have a very important role to save the world and there would be support from the US armies/troops. This one was having a formula that was similar to the 3rd Transformers (Dark of The Moon) with some rather outrageous theory about the history, myth or legends. \n\nThe challenge of telling this kind of story was that it kind of makes the movie to be difficult to digest. It was not helping either when it was having too many side stories. This movie unfortunately was not able to compile the whole side stories (or even the main story) into a cohesive movie. It felt like so many parts being forced to be put into 1 movie. Sorry to say, this time I really could not enjoy the storyline, and it also had too many of unnecessary characters. \n\nPerhaps if they just stick to fewer characters, the movie would be more enjoyable. My personal views, the children involved in the beginning were a distraction (including Izabella) and some of the Autobots &amp; Decepticons minor roles were really not interesting. Even John Turturo's character of Seymour from all previous Transformers' movies felt forced to be included. The only worthy characters that I felt have significant importance were Edmund Burton and Viviane. The Autobots that were also worthwhile to see were Cogman, Hot Rod, Bumblebee and of course our real favorite, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen).\n\nApart from the lousy story line and too many characters, the movie was certainly excellent in term of its special effects and its 3D effects. As I found out that 98% of the movie was shot in IMAX 3D camera, all those effects felt truly amazing. However, I got to say that the sound effects did not feel too spectacular. I am not sure if the cinema was only focusing on IMAX and hence it did not have the good sound system, but I was not really entertained with it. The movie did have some funny and interesting moments especially during the time when Edmund, Viviane, Cogman and Cade were in the same screen. But other than that, it did not have too much funny moments. My views is that the movie would definitely be trashed by critics though general audience would probably still be interested and attracted to see this in theaters.\n\nSo if you are a fan of Transformers movies and have been following the previous 4 movies, you would definitely still be entertained with this one, even though the Transformers were not as many as the earlier ones. My wife and I still believed that the original Transformers was still the best of all 5, and unfortunately this one fell into the least enjoyable of them all. I am actually not really fussy about storyline when I watched a full special effects action movie like this one as I would not expect it as Oscar worthy movie anyway, but if it was up to the point of making it less enjoyable, then it became a downside. However, if you are a hardcore fan who do not care about the story at all, and just want to see those cool special effects and the amazing Optimus Prime in action, then you should definitely see this one. Recommended to see this in IMAX 3D (but you must be prepared to be tired as it has a duration of 2.5 hours). \n\nFor my complete review, pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id\n\n- MichaelNontonMulu\n- Jun 20, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### The Worst Transformers Movie, And That's Saying Something\n\n- zaidmnomani\n- May 27, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### More from this title\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment in the Avatar film series. It features Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald reprising their roles from the first film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role[6] and Kate Winslet joining the cast. It follows a blue-skinned humanoid Na'vi named Jake Sully (Worthington) as he and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan of Pandora, a habitable exomoon on which they live.\n\nCameron said in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it were successful, and he announced the first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the necessity to develop new technology to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing, preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with Avatar: Fire and Ash, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to Wellington on September 25, 2017, which ended in late September 2020 after three years of shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, the film is one of the most expensive ever made.\n\nAfter repeated delays in release, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on December 6, 2022, and was released in the United States on December 16. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the visual effects and technical achievements but criticized the runtime and simplicity of the plot.[10] It was a major box office success, breaking multiple records, and grossing $2.320 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2022, the highest-grossing film since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the third-highest-grossing film of all time. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named The Way of Water one of the top-ten films of 2022. Among its many accolades, the film was nominated for four awards at the 95th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Visual Effects. The third Avatar film, subtitled Fire and Ash, is set to be released in December 2025.\n\n## Plot\n\nSixteen years after the Na'vi repelled the Resources Development Administration (RDA) from Pandora,[a] Jake Sully is chief of the Omatikaya clan and raises his family with Neytiri, consisting of two sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, his daughter Tuktirey \"Tuk\", and adopted daughter Kiri, who was born from Dr. Grace Augustine's inert avatar. Miles \"Spider\" Socorro, son of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, frequently visits their children while being raised by human scientists who stayed on Pandora.\n\nThe RDA returns to colonize Pandora. Among their ranks are Recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human soldiers, with a recombinant Quaritch as their leader. Jake leads a guerrilla warfare against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, but Quaritch manages to capture Spider, subsequently recognizing him as his son. After the RDA unsuccessfully interrogates Spider for additional information, Quaritch decides to spend time with Spider to gain his favor. In return, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language.\n\nAware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge, Jake and his family relocate themselves from the Omatikaya to Pandora's eastern sea, inhabited by the Metkayina clan. There, the family assimilates with the Metkayina: Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea, Jake and Neytiri assist Chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal, while Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, their daughter. Following an altercation between Lo'ak and Tonowari's son Aonung after the latter mocked Kiri, Lo'ak apologizes at Jake's insistence due to initiating the fight. Aonung and his friends entice Lo'ak to a hunting trip, stranding him in a sea predator's territory. Lo'ak is saved from the predator by Payakan, a Tulkun—an intelligent and pacifist whale-like species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual brethren—and befriends Payakan. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's friendship by accepting blame for the trip but is told that Payakan is an outcast. Later, Kiri links to the Metkayina's underwater Spirit Tree and meets Grace in a vision, but suffers a seizure during the link-induced trance and nearly drowns. Jake summons his friends Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help, who diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again.\n\nQuaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the Metkayina's archipelago. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with the RDA's marine operations and commandeers a whaling vessel hunting Tulkuns. Quaritch's squad begins raiding the archipelago but fails to find Jake after interrogating various tribes. Quaritch decides to massacre villages and kill Tulkuns to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns he was cast out because he attacked human whalers who killed his mother, which magnified the bloodshed.\n\nWhen the Metkayina learns of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak warns Payakan, joined by his siblings. They find Payakan being hunted and are captured by Quaritch. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina confront the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan attacks the vessel, sparking a battle between the Matkayina and the humans. Spider cripples the vessel while Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider, but is fatally shot. Traumatized by Neteyam's death, Jake and Neytiri resolve to save their recaptured daughters. Jake faces Quaritch, who holds Kiri hostage, but backs down when Neytiri does the same with Spider. They all get trapped inside the sinking vessel. After a tense skirmish, Jake strangles Quaritch unconscious and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri saves Neytiri and Tuk. Spider saves Quaritch from drowning but rejects him and rejoins Jake's family.\n\nAfter Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina. However, Tonowari identifies Jake's family as part of the clan out of reverence and welcomes them to stay. Jake's family accepts their new lives at sea but vows to continue their struggle against the RDA.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nleft to right: , , and  (all pictured in 2022), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n- Sam Worthington as Jake Sully: a former human who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become Na'vi and is now chief of the Omatikaya.[11][12]\n- Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite: the daughter of the previous leaders of the Omatikaya, the clan's future spiritual leader, and Jake's mate.[11][12]\n- Sigourney Weaver as Kiri te Suli Kireysi'ite: the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's Na'vi avatar who was adopted by Jake and Neytiri.[ 13] Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human scientist who took the side of the Na'vi and died during the conflict. Her Na'vi avatar is revealed to have birthed Kiri despite her death. Like most of the cast, she learned free-diving for the film and filmed scenes underwater.[ 14]\n    - Weaver also reprises her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, despite Weaver's saying in 2014 that she would not do so, though she and Cameron confirmed prior to then that she would return in the sequels:[6][15][16] she appears in this film in a video recording and in a spiritual vision in which she meets with Kiri.\n- Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch : a human military officer who led the paramilitary division of the RDA in their conflict with the Na'vi.[ 17] After being killed by Neytiri, he is resurrected as a Recombinant[ 17] and seeks revenge against Jake and his family. Cameron said that Quaritch would act as the main antagonist in all five planned films.[ 18] [ 19] [ 20] [ 21]\n    - Lang also reprises his role as the late human Quaritch in a contingency video prepared for his Recombinant self.\n- Kate Winslet as Ronal: a free diver of the Metkayina, the clan's spiritual leader, and pregnant wife of Tonowari.[22][23] Winslet called Ronal \"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\" but also \"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\" since shooting all her scenes only took a month.[24] It marks her first time working with performance capture, and motion capture altogether. She, like most of the cast, also had to learn free diving for the film; while filming an underwater scene, she held her breath for over seven minutes, a new record for any film scene shot underwater.[14][24][25][26]\n- Cliff Curtis as Tonowari: the chief of the Metkayina clan and Ronal's husband.[27][28][29]\n- Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman: a former Avatar Program scientist who allies with the Na'vi.[30]\n- CCH Pounder as Mo'at: the Omatikaya's spiritual leader, and Neytiri's mother.[31][32]\n- Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore: the commander in charge of the RDA's interests.[33]\n- Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby: the head of an RDA private sector marine hunting vessel on the moon of Pandora.[34]\n- Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin: a marine biologist working for the RDA.[35]\n- Jamie Flatters as Neteyam te Suli Tsyeyk'itan: Jake and Neytiri's 16-year-old son and oldest child.[ 36] [ 37]\n    - Jeremy Irwin as young Neteyam.[38]\n    - Joel David Moore's son Oliver cameos as the infant Neteyam.[39]\n- Britain Dalton as Lo'ak te Suli Tsyeyk'itan: Jake and Neytiri's 14-year-old son.[ 36] [ 37]\n    - Chloe Coleman as young Lo'ak.\n- Trinity Bliss as Tuktirey \"Tuk\" te Suli Neytiri'ite: Jake and Neytiri's 8-year-old daughter and their youngest child.[36][37][40]\n- Jack Champion as Miles \"Spider\" Socorro: the 16-year-old son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human base on Pandora in the first film) who was raised by scientists who stayed back on Pandora and wears Na'vi attire and an oxygen mask when outside a building. He is inseparable from Jake and Neytiri's children.[36][37][41]\n- Bailey Bass as Tsireya \"Reya\": a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal's daughter[36][37]\n- Filip Geljo as Aonung: a young male hunter, a free diver of the Metkayina, and Tonowari and Ronal's son[36][37]\n- Duane Evans Jr. as Rotxo: a young male hunter and free diver of the Metkayina[36][37]\n- Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge: the former corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation, who appears in a recording made for Quaritch's Recombinant.[42][43][44]\n- Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel: a former Avatar program scientist who allies with the Na'vi.[45]\n- Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet: a Recombinant under Quaritch's command. Gerald was announced to reprise his role in August 2017.[ 29]\n    - Gerald also reprises his role as the original human Wainfleet from the first film shown in Quaritch's video recording.\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears uncredited as Zdinarsk, a Recombinant and member of the 1st Recom Squadron. Vela-Bailey previously portrayed Ikeyni, Saeyla, and a blonde woman in a bar in the original Avatar. She is also featured as a stunt performer in both films.[46][47] CJ Jones appears, also uncredited, as a Metkayina interpreter of the Na'vi sign language he created.[48] Keston John plays Tarsem, a member of the Omatikaya clan who succeeds Jake when he and his family flee to the Metkayina territories.\n\n## Themes and analysis\n\nFamily is the central concept featured in Avatar: The Way of Water.[49][50][51] RogerEbert.com critic Brian Tallerico notes that some of the themes in the film echo themes from earlier films directed by Cameron, including Titanic (1997), Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). For example, the film asks whether you should run and hide from a powerful enemy or fight their evil, similar to the Terminator films. The film also invokes themes of environmentalism and settler colonialism.[52] Comparing the themes of the sequels to the original, Cameron said \"It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you're gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you're probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you're probably gonna love these\".[53]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector James Cameron in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2006, James Cameron said if Avatar (2009) were successful, he would consider making two sequels.[7] In 2010, he said the sequels would proceed as planned as a result of the film's widespread success.[8] The sequels were originally scheduled for release in December 2014 and 2015.[9] He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups.[7][11] Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work \"once the novel is nailed down\".[54] He said the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus.[55] The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest.[56] He intended to capture footage for the sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible.[57] In 2011, Cameron said he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be \"strident\" since the film will concentrate on entertainment.[58] The sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri in December 2009.[12] Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story.[59] In 2011, Cameron said he would film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, to add a heightened sense of reality.[60]\n\nIn 2013, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500 million (approximately US$410 million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).[61][62]\n\nCameron mentioned a possible third sequel for the first time in 2012; and was officially confirmed the following year.[63][64] Cameron was then looking to release Avatar 2 in 2015, but later that year, production was rescheduled for 2014, with the film to be released in December 2016, and to be followed by the two other sequels in 2017 and 2018.[65] By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year, with the first sequel expected to be released in December 2017; this was due to the writing process, which Cameron called \"a complex job\".[66][67] The following month, Fox announced a further release delay.[68] In February 2016, production of the sequels was scheduled to begin in April 2016 in New Zealand.[69] In April 2016, Cameron announced at CinemaCon that there will be four Avatar sequels, all of which will be filmed simultaneously.[70]\n\nNew crew members include cinematographer Russell Carpenter, who worked with Cameron on True Lies (1994) and Titanic (1997), and Aashrita Kamath, who will act as art director on all four sequels.[71][72][73] Kirk Krack, founder of Performance Freediving International, worked as a free-diving trainer for the cast and crew for the underwater scenes.[74] Several creatures that were first introduced in the Walt Disney World theme park attraction Avatar Flight of Passage were featured in the film.[75]\n\nIn 2019, after several media outlets shared rumors of potential titles for the Avatar sequels, including the name Avatar: The Way of Water, Cameron confirmed that the titles mentioned were \"among titles that are in consideration\" but had not been finalized at the time.[76]\n\nIn 2022, Cameron said that about ten minutes of \"gunplay action\" were cut from the film as he was no longer inclined to \"fetishize the gun\", although he is known as an \"action filmmaker\".[77]\n\n### Writing\n\nIn 2012, Cameron said the sequels were being written as \"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the second, and Shane Salerno for the third.[65] However, Friedman later clarified and said Jaffa and Silver were writing the first of the four sequels and he was writing the second.[78] In April 2014, Cameron expected to finish the (then) three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases.[79][80] He said although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first worked together on all three scripts: \"I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie.\"[65][81][82][18][78][83] Cameron added that they had \"worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga\", a creative process that was inspired by his experiences in the writing room of his television series Dark Angel.[84] The writing took longer than expected, forcing Cameron to delay the release of the films further in 2015.[66]\n\nHe spent a year writing the script for the first sequel titled Avatar: The High Ground, a 130-page treatment and then threw it out and started over because \"it didn't go enough into the unexpected,\" which is one of the critical elements about sequels, according to Cameron. At one point, he threatened to fire his writers because they would only focus on the new stories, rather than first figuring out what made the original movie a success.[85][86] In December 2015, in an interview with  Entertainment Weekly Cameron said: \"I'm in the process of doing another pass through all three scripts [...] Just refining. That's in parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for about a year and a half. All the characters, settings and creatures are all pretty much [set].\"[87] On February 11, 2017, Cameron announced that the writing of all four sequels was complete.[88] In a November 26 interview the same year, he estimated that the scripts had taken four years to write overall.[53] One element in The High Ground, showing an outer space battle between Na'vi, humans and spaceships was cut; this was later used in the prequel novel of the same name. Cameron cited the omission of the sequel's core aspects, which were insufficient, as reasons for the removal.[89][90]\n\nDiscussing the character of Tuk in a February 2019 interview, Cameron mentioned that she was eight years old, and that the film would feature a scene between Jake and Neytiri taking place from Tuk's perspective: \"There's a three-page argument scene between Jake and Neytiri, a marital dispute, very, very critical to the storyline. I wound up shooting it all from the point of view of the 8-year-old hiding under the structure and peeking in. Having gone through the experience with [Sam Worthington] on Avatar, I now knew how to write the Jake character going forward across the emotional rollercoaster of the next four movies.\"[40][91] Cameron said the film addresses the implications of Jake and Neytiri becoming parents in the time that elapsed since the first film.[92] He said:\n\nBecoming a parent changes so much of your behavior and your value system...What we saw in the first film were people who were fearless. Jake would throw himself off his ikran onto a leonopteryx (creatures featured in Avatar) but is a father of four going do that?...He's trying to keep his kids alive and trying to adjust his own life. Is he still a warrior? Are these young boys who are 14, 15, 16, coming up, getting all excited about wanting to go to war and fight for their people and for their land? How's [Jake] going to be a hypocrite and hold them back when he has to go do it?[92]\n\nIn a December 2019 interview, Lang said his character was always meant to return in the sequels, as Cameron had shared with him \"that Quaritch had a future\" while shooting the original film.[93]\n\n### Casting\n\nProducer Landau, Worthington, Saldaña, Cameron, Weaver and Lang promoting the film in Tokyo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña were confirmed in January 2010 to have signed on to reprise their roles in the sequels.[11] Later that year, Cameron confirmed that both Weaver and Stephen Lang would return despite the demise of their characters.[18][15] Cameron also said Weaver would be featured in all three sequels (the fourth one was not planned at the time), and that her character, Grace Augustine, would be alive.[16] In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.[6] Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return as Quaritch in the first three sequels, stating, \"I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga.\"[18][19] In September 2015, Michelle Rodriguez said unlike Weaver and Lang, whose characters had also died in the first film, she would not return in Avatar 2.[94]\n\nSeveral new cast announcements were made in 2017, with Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Matt Gerald all confirmed to return from the first film.[31][32][29][30] Additionally, Cliff Curtis joined the cast as Tonowari, the leader of the Na'vi reef people clan of Metkayina.[27][29] On September 23, 2017, child actor Filip Geljo was revealed to have been signed in an undisclosed role.[95] On September 27, seven child actors were confirmed as a part of the main cast including Geljo: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as Jake and Neytiri's children; Geljo, Bailey Bass and Duane Evans Jr. as members of the Metkayina (together with Curtis); and Jack Champion, the only one to perform in live action, as a human born on Pandora.[36][37] Cameron later said the child cast had been trained for six months to prepare for the underwater scenes filmed in performance capture, and that they now could all hold their breath \"in the two- to four-minute range\", even then-seven-year-old Trinity Bliss, and were now \"all perfectly capable of acting underwater, very calmly while holding their breath\".[96][97]\n\nOn October 3, 2017, it was reported that Winslet, who starred in Cameron's Titanic, had joined the cast of Avatar 2, and possibly its sequels. Cameron commented: \"Kate and I had been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on Titanic, which was one of the most rewarding of my career\", and added that her character was named Ronal.[22][98][23] When asked by ComicBook.com on her reasons to return to work with Cameron, Winslet said he just asked her to play Ronal and she accepted out of a combination of her love for the first Avatar film, an attraction to the well-written and strong female role she was offered, a love for being on the water and to work with Cameron and the film's cast.[99] Although the nature of her character was originally unknown, the following month Cameron said Ronal was \"part of the Sea People, the reef people\", in reference to the Na'vi clan of Metkayina, making Avatar 2 Winslet's first role via performance capture, or motion capture altogether, which she was looking forward to; since she insisted on performing all of her character's movements herself, she, like the child cast, had to learn free diving for the film.[53][24] Winslet, who had been notoriously reluctant about working with Cameron again because of the complicated situations he puts his actors in for their scenes, said Cameron proposed the role to her in July 2017 when he came to help her and their fellow Titanic collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio at a fundraiser in France, sending her the scripts shortly after.[24] She commented that her role was \"relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot\", as she would only have one month of shootings, but also \"a pivotal character in the ongoing story\".[24]\n\nOn October 13, 2017, it was announced that Giovanni Ribisi would reprise his role of Parker Selfridge from the first film, in all four upcoming Avatar films.[43] On January 25, 2018, Dileep Rao was confirmed to return as Dr. Max Patel. A year later, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell and Jemaine Clement joined the cast in live-action roles.[33][34][35] Marc Maron also auditioned for Clement's part.[100] Edward Norton turned down an undisclosed role in Avatar 2, due to only being interested in playing a Na'vi, which his proposed character was not.[101] Joel David Moore's then infant son, Oliver, filmed a brief cameo as an infant Neteyam.[39]\n\n### Filming\n\n#### Performance capture\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California, as the main shooting location.[102] Principal photography began on September 25, 2017, on a $350–$460 million budget; the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.[2][3][103] It was simultaneously filmed with Avatar: Fire and Ash (2025).[104] As Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of Doc Martin (2004–22).[105]\n\nOn November 23, Cameron said the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14, featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss.[53] He said \"we're getting really good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the code\".[96][97] The cast and crew did not use scuba sets as \"air bubbles might interfere with the accuracy of the sensors\". Another problem with underwater scenes was how the infrared light used in performance capture was not registered by the camera sensors as it was absorbed by the water, and so UV-light had to be used instead. Two separate performance capture systems were made; one used underwater, and another above the water, which had to work in sync with one another.[106] Cameron said that tests would last until January 2018, as \"we're still working in our small test tank. We graduate to our big tank in January\".[96] It was \"a dialogue scene\", as according to Cameron, the characters communicate via \"a kind of a sign language\".[53] The underwater fight scene between Worthington and Lang was difficult, based on their interviews. Worthington considered this a risky option because doing choke-outs can cause drowning. Overseen by a safety team during the shoot, the actors ensured their survival.[49][107]\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Winslet had \"just a couple days\" of shooting left to do.[108] While filming an underwater scene, Winslet held her breath for over seven minutes, breaking the record for longest breath held while shooting a film scene underwater, a record previously held by Tom Cruise for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015).[14] In May 2018, Saldaña said filming was \"kind of only halfway done\" and that the crew is \"about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand.\"[109] Saldaña finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both Avatar 2 and its sequel, while Cameron said around the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot.[25][26] On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.[21]\n\nPart of the movie was shot at 24 frames per second, but many fast scenes were filmed at 48 frames per second. This allows fast objects still to be clearly visible when moving, but it was also said that too detailed a view sometimes causes the viewer to see playing actors rather than story characters. The projector in the movie hall runs at 48 frames per second, for the 24 fps sections frames are duplicated.[110] To avoid the soap opera effect, Lightstorm Entertainment hired Pixelworks in 2020, which used their TrueCut Motion software to create \"motion grading\", a tool that ensure a movie keep its theatrical appearance.[111]\n\n#### Live-action\n\nIn February 2019, Landau said live-action filming for Avatar 2 and 3 would commence in New Zealand in the spring of 2019.[112] Cameron confirmed later the same month that they had \"only wrapped for [the motion capture parts]. Now, that is the vast majority of the characters and it is the vast majority of the running time of the film[s]. But that pesky little live action component is going to cost me five months of my life across the two movies.\"[113] Filming for 2019 concluded on November 29, to resume the following year in New Zealand.[114][115][116]\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Landau announced that the filming of the Avatar sequel films in New Zealand had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also confirmed that production would remain in Los Angeles.[117] However, virtual production continued in Manhattan Beach, California while visual effects continued at Weta Digital in Wellington.[118] In early May, health and safety production protocols had been endorsed by the New Zealand government, allowing filming to resume in the country.[119]\n\nOn June 1, 2020, Landau posted a picture of himself and Cameron on Instagram, showing that they had returned to New Zealand to resume filming. After their arrival, Cameron and 55 other crew members who had traveled to New Zealand started a 2-week government-supervised isolation period at a hotel in Wellington before they would resume filming. This would make Avatar 2 and 3 the first major Hollywood blockbusters to resume production after postponing filming due to the pandemic.[120][121][122][123] On June 16, 2020, Cameron resumed filming and Landau posted a photo of his crew on Instagram filming the production.[124][125] The New Zealand production hired 46 New Zealand cast members including Cliff Curtis (Tonowari) and Duane Evans Jr. (Roxto), 114 local stunt artists, almost 800 extras, and 36 apprentices and interns.[126][127] In September 2020, Cameron confirmed that live action filming in New Zealand had been completed, therefore completing the shooting of the film altogether after over three years; he estimated Avatar: Fire and Ash to be \"95%\" completed, due to having live-action parts yet to be filmed outside of New Zealand.[128][129][130]\n\nIn July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the Avatar sequels had received over NZ$140 million worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant. By comparison, The Hobbit trilogy (2012–2014) had received NZ$161 million in film subsidies. While ACT party deputy leader Brooke van Velden criticised the Government's film subsidy programme for allegedly taking public funding from other areas, the Economic Development and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash argued that New Zealand's film subsidies for major Hollywood products brought much needed overseas investment and jobs to the New Zealand film industry.[131]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nIt's never been done before and it's very tricky because our motion capture system, like most motion capture systems, is what they call optical base, meaning that it uses markers that are photographed with hundreds of cameras. The problem with water is not the underwater part, but the interface between the air and the water, which forms a moving mirror. That moving mirror reflects all the dots and markers, and ... it creates thousands of false targets, so we've had to figure out how to get around that problem, which we did. ... It's taken us about a year and a half now to work out how we're going to do it.\n\nOn July 31, 2017, it was announced that Wētā FX had commenced work on the Avatar sequels.[134] The film heavily features underwater scenes, actually filmed underwater with the cast in performance capture.[96][97] Blending underwater filming and performance capture being a feature never accomplished before, it took the team a year and a half to develop a new motion capture system.[133][132] In December 2022, Wētā FX's VFX producer David Conley described Avatar 2 as the biggest visual effects project that the company had ever undertaken, totalling nearly 3.3 billion thread powers. To cope with the huge amount of data, Wētā used the services of cloud storage company Amazon Web Services.[135]\n\nIn November 2015, Landau said Avatar 2 would have a number of major technological improvements since the first movie. A lot more of the lighting work on the virtual production stage could be done during production instead of post-production, and like Alita: Battle Angel (2019), which is produced and co-written by Cameron, the crew can use two lightweight HD head cams to record the actors' facial performance. In addition they also used two digital puppets instead of just one; one that is an accurate copy of the real actor, and another that is the actor's character, allowing the team to re-target one onto the other to make it as accurate as possible.[136][137]\n\nCameron said there was a possibility that the film could be shown in \"glasses-free 3D\", along with the sequels.[138][139] But he later disagreed with these rumors and did not think the technology would be there yet.[140]\n\nIndustrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) also returned to assist the VFX for the film after doing so with Weta for the final battle of the first film. ILM assisted in delivering 48 one-off VFX shots for the film's opening scenes.[141][142]\n\nThe film was completed on November 23, 2022.[143]\n\n### Runtime\n\nIn July 2022, Empire revealed the runtime was \"around three hours\" at that stage in production.[144] In November 2022, the film's runtime was revealed to be 192 minutes (three hours and twelve minutes).[1] In the Empire interview, Cameron said: \"I don't want anybody whining about length when they sit and binge-watch [television] for eight hours... I've watched my kids sit and do five one-hour episodes in a row. Here's the big social paradigm shift that has to happen: it's okay to get up and go pee.\"[145][146]\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water is the second Disney-distributed film and the second 20th Century Studios film, after Avengers: Endgame and Titanic respectively, to exceed three hours in length.[147]\n\n## Music\n\nAvatar composer James Horner was originally reported to score music for the franchise, before his death in June 2015.[148] In December 2019, Simon Franglen, who had previously worked with both Cameron and Horner as record producer and arranger since 1997's Titanic, including on Avatar (notably completing Horner's score for 2016's The Magnificent Seven after his death), was reported to write music for the film.[149] Landau confirmed his involvement in the project in August 2021, while also associating with the forthcoming Avatar sequels.[150][151] Horner's score was reused in the film, in addition to the original themes produced by Franglen.[151] The scoring for Avatar: The Way of Water officially began on July 29, 2022.[152] The soundtrack album was released on December 16, 2022, by Hollywood Records.[153][154] An expanded score album, featuring ten more tracks from the original score, followed four days later.[155]\n\nIn November 2022, it was reported that the film would feature an original song titled \"Song Chord\" which will be performed by Franglen and Zoe Saldaña.[156] The following month, it was announced that Canadian singer the Weeknd would contribute an original song \"Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength)\" to the film, produced by Franglen and Swedish supergroup Swedish House Mafia.[153][157]\n\n## Marketing\n\nDisney extensively promoted Avatar: The Way of Water across multiple media platforms, including merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising.[158]\nAt the 2022 CinemaCon,[159] the new title for the sequel was officially announced and the first teaser trailer was debuted at the event,[160] along with four new first look images, showing off the adventures of the Na'vi on and off the coasts of Pandora.[6] It was theatrically showcased at the premiere of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,[161][162] and was later released online on May 9.[163] The teaser finished its first 24-hour online window with 148.6 million views,[164] including 23 million from China alone, according to Disney and 20th Century.[165][166] Grant Ridner of GQ commented: \"The trailer features minimal dialogue and primarily focuses on shots of the cerulean Pandora and its residents, as well as indigenous flora and fauna.\"[167] However, Stuart Heritage of The Guardian criticized the teaser, saying: \"There isn't a trace of premise here, or character, or any real action to speak of. Instead, we're given a minute and a half of nice-looking scenery. It's like being held hostage to look at someone's holiday photos.\"[168] Louis Chilton of The Independent also felt that the trailer \"feels rather too much like a tech demo, or the trailer for a long-gestating video-game sequel\".[169]\n\nIn June 2022, the teaser was edited by Disney ahead of the theatrical screenings of Pixar's Lightyear, where sequences featuring Sully holding a rifle and few guns were edited. According to Russ Burlingame of Comic Book Resources, the trailer was edited due to \"public sentiments to avoid glorifying gun violence\" as Lightyear released after the Robb Elementary School shooting incident,[170] while TheWrap's Drew Taylor opined that the change was made on the request of the Motion Picture Association for attaching the trailer with PG-rated films.[171] New set photos were released by Empire on June 30, showing Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis in their Na'vi forms,[172] and subsequent photos were released on the following day, showing Sigourney Weaver as Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage Na'vi daughter, Kiri.[13] Though the film was not promoted at San Diego Comic-Con, Lego released four new sets from the franchise as a part of the promotions.[173]\n\nEight minutes of the film's footage were showcased in 3D at the D23 Expo on September 10, 2022.[174][175] McFarlane Toys had launched several action figures based on the characters and creatures, which were unveiled at the event.[176] The collections were officially released on October 1.[177] A second excerpt from the film was shown during the credits of the Avatar re-release on September 23, which evidently varies in different versions and screenings.[178][179] The official trailer was released on November 2 at Good Morning America.[180][181] New poster characters were released on November 21, and the second and final trailer was also released then.[182][183] An 18-minute clip of \"never-seen-before\" footage from the film was exclusively released at the CCXP convention on December 2.[184] The footage features independent storylines surrounding Jake's character and events occurring several years since the first film.[185]\n\nDisney initiated the environmental global campaign, \"Keep Our Oceans Amazing\", to support the Nature Conservancy in the conservation of marine habitats and animal species.[158][186] A concept art book titled The Art of Avatar: The Way of Water, written by Tara Bennett with a foreword by Robert Rodriguez, was made available for pre-order in October 2022, and was set to be released simultaneously with the film.[187] Another book titled Avatar The Way of Water: The Visual Dictionary by Joshua Izzo is also set to be released with the film.[187]\n\nDeadline Hollywood estimated that advertisers paid more than $170 million for promos. Lightstorm Entertainment and Mercedes-Benz revealed the Vision AVTR concept car inspired by the film at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020. Amazon Echo enabled interactions for its Alexa virtual assistant based on the film, the first time it did so for any film. In China, Disney partnered with JD.com and Alipay for advertising, while Razer Inc. launched the Yaqi Orochi V2 Avatar computer mouse in the country themed after the film. NYX Professional Makeup owned by L'Oréal promoted a lineup of makeup products inspired by the film. Kellogg's launched an estimated 53 million Avatar-themed packages across its three labels. Motorola Mobility and Deutsche Telekom partnered with Disney to promote the film in Latin America and EMEA respectively.[188]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water's world premiere was held on December 6, 2022, at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London.[189] The film was released to theaters in some countries on December 14, 2022,[190] and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16 by Disney subsidiary 20th Century Studios.[191][192][193] The film is the first in the series to be released under Disney, since its acquisition of the entertainment properties of 21st Century Fox and therein the rights to Avatar in 2019.[194][195] The film was released in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX and IMAX 3D formats. Select showings also had support for a dynamic high frame rate of up to 48 frames per second.[196] The Way of Water, alongside the forthcoming sequels, was released in Dolby Vision.[53] The Way of Water is one of the widest releases ever given for a Disney film, debuting on over 12,000 screens in the United States and Canada and 40,000 internationally.[197]\n\nThe 2023 Hollywood Professional Association Tech Retreat revealed that 1,065 individual Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) were created for the film's theatrical release. This includes specific variations of the film presented in formats such as 2D, 3D, HDR, 4K, varying light levels, aspect ratios and various audio formats, as well as 51 subtitled languages and 28 dubbed language variations. According to Disney's Motion Pictures Operations VP Kim Beresford, the film was divided into 15 reels (resulting in 6,338 portions) to be completed in time; allowing the DCP mastering team to begin creating delivery elements before the complete film was locked. Roughly 800 DCPs were reviewed for quality control five days prior to the film's release date. Walt Disney Studios' VP of Distribution Technology Mark Arana said: \"We had to turn our operation into a 24/7 support model.\" Additionally, Disney's distribution team invented a new system to create and keep track of the numerous versions as well as a cloud-based DCP mastering tool.[198][excessive detail?]\n\nThe film was subjected to eight delays, as the crew took more time on the writing, pre-production and visual effects process. Initially in late-2010, the film was scheduled for release in December 2014.[9] By mid-2013, Cameron originally intended Avatar 2 to be released in December 2015,[65] which was subsequently delayed to 2016 and then to 2017.[67][66] In April 2016, Cameron announced four Avatar sequels which would be released in December 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023;[70] but, in March 2017, he said this film would not be released in 2018, due to extensive production and the visual effects process.[199]\n\nIn April 2017, a new release date of December 18, 2020, was announced, with all the other sequels: Avatar 3, 4 and 5 releasing on December 17, 2021, December 20, 2024, and December 19, 2025, respectively.[200] However, following the announcement of the three upcoming Star Wars films,[201] in May 2019, the sequels were delayed another two years, with this film being scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021.[202] The release date was again deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in August 2020, a new release date of December 16, 2022, was announced.[196][203][191] Mentioning the delays, Cameron felt optimistic that they would not harm the films' success, likening Avatar 2 to his films Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.[53][204] The film was also approved for release in China, making it one of the few Hollywood blockbusters to be greenlit for distribution in the country in 2022.[205]\n\n### Home media\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water was released for digital download on March 28, 2023. It contains behind-the-scenes featurettes.[206] The film was released on June 7, 2023, on Disney+ and Max.[207][208] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (under the 20th Century Home Entertainment label) distributed Avatar: The Way of Water on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD on June 20, 2023.[209] Disney released an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[210]\n\nOn February 2, 2024, the film became available to stream in variable high frame rate in 3D 4K Dolby Vision on the Disney+ app for visionOS.[211]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nTheater attendees watching the film in 3D in Barcelona\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water grossed $684.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.636 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.320 billion.[4][5] It had a worldwide opening of $441.7 million, the eleventh-biggest of all time, and the third largest in the COVID-19 pandemic era, behind Spider-Man: No Way Home ($601 million) and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($452.4 million). IMAX accounted for $48.8 million, the second-highest global weekend ever for a film released in IMAX cinemas.[212][213] It is the highest-grossing film of 2022, the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[214][215] and the highest-grossing film of the pandemic era.[216]\n\nIt is the fourth film to reach the $1 billion milestone in the pandemic era after Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick and Jurassic World Dominion, as well as the sixth-fastest overall to reach the milestone at 14 days.[217][218] It crossed the $2 billion milestone on January 22, becoming the first film in the pandemic era and the sixth in history to reach the milestone. It is also the second-fastest to gross over $2 billion, reaching the milestone in 40 days.[219][220] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $531.7 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2022's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[221]\n\n#### United States and Canada\n\nBy December 14, 2022, prior to the film's release in the United States and Canada, Boxoffice Pro projected an opening weekend of $145–179 million, and a total final gross of $574–803 million.[222] The film made $53.2 million on its first day, including $17 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to a $134.1 million weekend, nearly double the original's opening of $77 million, but coming in below expectations while finishing first at the box office.[223][224] Deadline Hollywood and Variety wrote that strong audience exit scores, the small day-to-day drop, limited competition from other films and the upcoming Christmas holiday all indicated likely strong legs at the box office.[3][225]\n\nThe film made $63.3 million in its second weekend, a drop of 53%,[226] and $95.6 million over the four-day Christmas weekend, remaining atop the box office.[227] Box office analysts partially attributed the December 2022 North American winter storm for the drop.[228][229] In the third weekend, it grossed $67.4 million for an increase of 6%, and also grossed $88.8 million through the four-day New Year weekend,[230][231] while becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2022 in the region.[232] It remained the highest-grossing film at the box office throughout its first seven weekends of release, the highest number of consecutive weekends for any film since the original Avatar.[233][234] It is also the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time in the US and Canada.[235]\n\n#### China\n\nOn the release day of Avatar: The Way of Water, Tianjin Maoyan Weiying Culture Media estimated that the film would make $357 million (¥2.5 billion) and $100 million in its opening weekend, later revising it down to $222 million (¥1.5 billion).[236][237] It grossed $57 million in the first week in China, according to Artisan Gateway. This included a gross of $51.3 million during the weekend. The box-office gross of the film was impacted by the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in the country. IMAX meanwhile reported that the film marked its best weekend ever in China, with a $15.8 million opening.[238] In the second weekend, the film grossed $25.9 million, for a drop of 55%,[239] and an increase of 42% during the New Year weekend with $36.9 million.[240] Avatar: The Way of Water ultimately grossed $245 million in China, slightly more than the $202 million that  Avatar earned in its initial run.[241][237]\n\n#### Other territories\n\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $307.6 million in 52 countries in its first week of release. The largest openings for the film by the end of the week were in China ($56.8 million), South Korea ($24.9 million), France ($21.7 million), Germany ($19.4 million) and India ($19.2 million).[212][213] In the second weekend, it grossed $168.6 million for a drop of 42%.[242] In the third weekend, it grossed $186.7 million, an increase of 6% from the previous weekend.[243] In the fourth weekend, it grossed $132.6 million for a drop of 30%, while becoming the highest-grossing film of the pandemic era outside the US and Canada.[244] The five largest-running total countries by February 26, 2023, are China ($249.8 million), France ($148.3 million), Germany ($138.3 million), South Korea ($105 million) and the United Kingdom ($91 million). It became the highest-grossing film of all time in twenty box office territories, including Germany, France, Austria, Turkey and New Zealand.[245][246][247][248]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 76% of 453 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Narratively, it might be fairly standard stuff—but visually speaking, Avatar: The Way of Water is a stunningly immersive experience.\"[249] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 68 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[250] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the first Avatar, while PostTrak reported 91% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 82% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3]\n\nPositive reviews focused on the visual spectacle of the film, and advocated seeing it in as large a format as possible.[10][251] Chicago-Sun Times critic Richard Roeper gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four stars, highlighting the film's visuals as \"some of the most dazzling, vibrant, and gorgeous images ever seen on screen\".[252] Variety critic Owen Gleiberman praised the film as a \"dizzyingly spectacular sequel\" with \"miraculously sustained\" combat sequences, \"scenes that will make your eyes pop, your head spin and your soul race\" and \"state-of-the-art 3D (never in-your-face, just images that look and feel sculpted) [that] makes the film's every underwater glide feel as experiential as one that you're literally on\". On the other hand, Gleiberman felt that the story is \"basic\" with a \"string of serviceable clichés\", \"bare-bones dialogue\" and little dimensionality to the characters.[253] The Atlantic critic David Sims said that the film will wow audiences and exhibit \"new delights...in the alien world of Pandora\" while noting that the film gets off to a slow start that is \"busy with plot details as the film updates the audience on the past decade-plus of Pandoran life\".[254] Science writer Darren Naish praised the creature design and detailed alien world, saying the series would remain a \"mainstay of discussions in creature design and speculative biology for some time yet\".[255]\n\nLos Angeles Times critic Justin Chang hailed Cameron as \"one of the few Hollywood visionaries who actually merits that much-abused term\" and said the film will \"stun most of his naysayers into silence\", while also praising the film's tenderness and sentimentality.[256] Entertainment Weekly critic Leah Greenblatt summarized her review of The Way of Water saying that it \"created its own whole-cloth reality, a meticulous world-building as astonishing and enveloping as anything we've ever seen on screen — until that crown is passed, inevitably, in December 2024, the projected release date for Avatar 3\".[257]\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the film was excessively long, and that the script was not substantial enough to justify the length.[10] The New Yorker critic Anthony Lane opined: \"The film is more than three hours long, some of it dangerously close to dawdling; not until the final third does Cameron apply the whip and remind us that, in the choreographing of action sequences, he remains unsurpassed.\"[258] The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw was critical of the \"scathingly bland plot\" and noted that, despite the shift in setting, \"there isn't a single interesting visual image\".[259] San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Mick LaSalle called it \"a one-hour story rattling around in a 192-minute bag\", while acknowledging that \"it looks pretty good\", incorporating \"one of the best uses of 3-D to date, with visuals that seem to have been conceived in three dimensions\".[260] The Telegraph critic Robbie Collin said that the film \"has no plot, no stakes and atrocious dialogue\" and that \"for all its world-building sprawl, The Way of Water is a horizon-narrowing experience – the sad sight of a great filmmaker reversing up a creative cul-de-sac\".[261] The Toronto Star commented that the film was poorly received by some indigenous peoples in Canada, being viewed as trying to portray the colonial struggles of an indigenous population, with reviewer Drew Hayden Taylor noting: \"It's also rather conventional in its own way and somewhat boring. Predictable. I've been involved in crooked card games with a less foreseeable storyline.\"[262]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, Avatar: The Way of Water received nominations for Best Picture, Best Sound, and Best Production Design; and won Best Visual Effects.[263] Its other nominations include two Annie Awards (winning both),[264] two British Academy Film Awards (winning one),[265] five Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning one),[266] and two Golden Globe Awards.[267] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named The Way of Water one of the ten-best films of 2022.[268][269]\n\n## Sequels\n\nThe Way of Water is the first of four planned sequels to Avatar. Avatar: Fire and Ash started filming simultaneously with this film in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Cast members from previous films, including Worthington, Saldaña, Lang, Weaver, Pounder, Winslet, Curtis, Ribisi, Moore, Rao, Gerald, Dalton, Bliss, Champion, Bass, and Geljo, have all been announced to return while Oona Chaplin, Michelle Yeoh, and David Thewlis will be playing new characters.[270][271][272][273]\n\nAccording to Kirk Krack, Cameron said that Fire and Ash will be 30% water, half of The Way of Water's 60%, and 4 and 5 15%.[106] The ocean scenes for the sequels were filmed simultaneously during the production of The Way of Water.[274]\n\nAlthough the last two sequels have been reportedly greenlit, in a November 2017 interview Cameron said: \"Let's face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don't make enough money, there's not going to be a 4 and 5.\"[53] Thewlis later confirmed this in February 2018, stating \"they're making 2 and 3, they're gonna see if people go and see them, and then they'll make 4 and 5.\"[275] Conversely in November 2018, Weaver said, after the first two sequels had completed main photography, that she was currently \"busy doing Avatar 4 and 5\", which several media outlets interpreted as confirmation that the last two sequels had started filming.[276][277][278]\n\nIn January 2019, in face of the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that both Avatar 4 and Avatar 5 are being developed but have not been officially greenlit.[279] According to producer Landau in February 2019, Iger may have been misinterpreted. He said that Avatar 4 and 5 \"are not only [greenlit]\" but also a third of Avatar 4 has already been filmed.[280]\n\nFollowing the box-office success of The Way of Water, Cameron confirmed that the sequels are effectively greenlit. \"It looks like with the momentum that the film has now that we'll easily pass our break even in the next few days, so it looks like I can't wiggle out of this and I'm gonna have to do these other sequels,\" Cameron said in January 2023, adding: \"I know what I'm going to be doing the next six or seven years\".[281] It was also confirmed that Brendan Cowell will reprise his role as Captain Mick Scoresby and will also feature the return of Payakan, the Tulkun who befriends Lo'ak.[282] Giovanni Ribisi will reprise his role as Parker Selfridge, with his character having a bigger role in the film after his brief cameo in The Way of Water.[283]\n\n## See also\n\n- Film portal\n- Science Fiction portal\n\n- Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\n- List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n- List of films with the longest production time\n- List of highest-grossing films\n- List of most expensive films\n- List of underwater science fiction works\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ As depicted in Avatar (2009)\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b McClintock, Pamela; Couch, Aaron (October 29, 2022). \"'Avatar: The Way of Water' Runtime Sails Past Three Hours\".

Miles \"Spider\" Socorro, son of the late Colonel Miles Quaritch, frequently visits their children while being raised by human scientists who stayed on Pandora.\n\n        The RDA returns to colonize Pandora. Among their ranks are Recombinants, Na'vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human soldiers, with a recombinant Quaritch as their leader. Jake leads a guerrilla warfare against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, but Quaritch manages to capture Spider, subsequently recognizing him as his son. After the RDA unsuccessfully interrogates Spider for additional information, Quaritch decides to spend time with Spider to gain his favor. In return, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language.\n\n        Aware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge, Jake and his family relocate themselves from the Omatikaya to Pandora's eastern sea, inhabited by the Metkayina clan. There, the family assimilates with the Metkayina: Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea, Jake and Neytiri assist Chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal, while Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, their daughter. Following an altercation between Lo'ak and Tonowari's son Aonung after the latter mocked Kiri, Lo'ak apologizes at Jake's insistence due to initiating the fight. Aonung and his friends entice Lo'ak to a hunting trip, stranding him in a sea predator's territory. Lo'ak is saved from the predator by Payakan, a Tulkun—an intelligent and pacifist whale-like species whom the Metkayina consider their spiritual brethren—and befriends Payakan. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's friendship by accepting blame for the trip but is told that Payakan is an outcast. Later, Kiri links to the Metkayina's underwater Spirit Tree and meets Grace in a vision, but suffers a seizure during the link-induced trance and nearly drowns. Jake summons his friends Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help, who diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again.\n\n        Quaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the Metkayina's archipelago. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with the RDA's marine operations and commandeers a whaling vessel hunting Tulkuns. Quaritch's squad begins raiding the archipelago but fails to find Jake after interrogating various tribes. Quaritch decides to massacre villages and kill Tulkuns to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns he was cast out because he attacked human whalers who killed his mother, which magnified the bloodshed.\n\n        When the Metkayina learns of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak warns Payakan, joined by his siblings. They find Payakan being hunted and are captured by Quaritch. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina confront the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but Payakan attacks the vessel, sparking a battle between the Matkayina and the humans. Spider cripples the vessel while Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider, but is fatally shot. Traumatized by Neteyam's death, Jake and Neytiri resolve to save their recaptured daughters. Jake faces Quaritch, who holds Kiri hostage, but backs down when Neytiri does the same with Spider. They all get trapped inside the sinking vessel. After a tense skirmish, Jake strangles Quaritch unconscious and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri saves Neytiri and Tuk. Spider saves Quaritch from drowning but rejects him and rejoins Jake's family.\n\n        After Neteyam's funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina. However, Tonowari identifies Jake's family as part of the clan out of reverence and welcomes them to stay. Jake's family accepts their new lives at sea but vows to continue their struggle against the RDA.\n    </Plot>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to be more readable while ensuring that the relevant information is tagged according to the specified attributes.

                                       |\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a 2023 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Scott Lang / Ant-Man and Hope Pym / Wasp. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), and the 31st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed by Peyton Reed, written by Jeff Loveness, and stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne, alongside Jonathan Majors, Kathryn Newton, David Dastmalchian, Katy O'Brian, William Jackson Harper, Bill Murray, Michelle Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll, and Michael Douglas. In the film, Lang, Van Dyne, and their family are accidentally transported to the Quantum Realm and face off against Kang the Conqueror (Majors).\n\nPlans for a third Ant-Man film were confirmed in November 2019, with Reed and Rudd returning. Loveness was hired by April 2020, with development beginning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The title and new cast members, including the additions of Majors and Newton, were announced in December 2020. Filming in Turkey began in early February 2021, and additional filming occurred in San Francisco in mid-June. Principal photography began at the end of July at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire and ended in November.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania premiered in Westwood, Los Angeles, on February 6, 2023, and was released in the United States on February 17. It is the first film, and beginning, of Phase Five of the MCU. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It was a box-office disappointment, grossing $476.1 million worldwide against a gross production budget of $388.4 million and becoming one of the few MCU films not to break-even in its theatrical run.\n\n## Plot\n\nFollowing the Avengers's battle against Thanos,[a] Scott Lang has become a successful memoirist and has been living happily with his girlfriend, Hope van Dyne. Scott's now-teenage daughter Cassie has become an activist, helping people displaced by the Blip, resulting in her having a strained relationship with her father. While visiting Hope's parents, Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, Cassie reveals that she has been working on a device that can establish contact with the Quantum Realm. Upon learning of this, Janet panics and forcefully shuts off the device, but the message is received, resulting in a portal that opens and sucks the five of them into the Quantum Realm. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Hank explore a sprawling city to get answers.\n\nHope, Janet, and Hank meet with Lord Krylar, a former ally of Janet's, who reveals that things have changed since she left,[b] and that he is now working for Kang, the Quantum Realm's new ruler. The three are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. The Langs, meanwhile, are told by rebel leader Jentorra that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. The rebels soon come under attack by Kang's forces led by M.O.D.O.K., who is revealed to be Darren Cross, having survived his apparent death at the hands of Scott,[c] and who previously received Cassie's message. Aboard Krylar's ship, Janet confesses to Hope and Hank that she met Kang when she was previously in the Quantum Realm. He claimed that he and Janet could both escape from the Quantum Realm if she helped him rebuild his multiversal power core. After they managed to repair it, Janet saw a vision of Kang conquering and destroying entire timelines. Kang revealed he was exiled by his variants out of fear, which drove Janet to turn against him. Outmatched, Janet used her Pym Particles to enlarge the power core beyond use. Kang, having regained his powers, eventually conquered the Quantum Realm afterward.\n\nThe Langs are taken to Kang, who demands that Scott help get his power core back or else he will kill Cassie. Scott is then taken to the core's location and shrinks down. In the core, he encounters a probability storm, which causes him to split into multiple copies of himself nearly overwhelming him, but Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang reneges on the deal, capturing Janet with M.O.D.O.K. destroying her ship with Hank on it. After being rescued by his ants, who rapidly evolved and became hyper-intelligent after being pulled into the Quantum Realm, Hank helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie convinces Cross to switch sides and fight Kang, with him eventually sacrificing his life.\n\nJanet fixes the power core as she, Hank, Hope, and Cassie jump through a portal home. Kang attacks Scott at the last minute. Before he can beat Scott into submission, Hope returns, and she and Scott throw Kang and the Pym Particles into the power core, destroying them both. Cassie reopens the portal for Scott and Hope to return home. As Scott happily resumes his life, he begins to rethink what he was told about Kang's death being the start of something terrible happening, but brushes it off. In a mid-credits scene, numerous variants of Kang, led by Immortus, commiserate Kang's death and plan their multiversal uprising. In a post-credits scene, Loki and Mobius M. Mobius encounter another Kang variant, Victor Timely, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.[d]\n\n## Cast\n\n- Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:\nAn Avenger and former petty criminal with a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while increasing in strength.[8] After the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Scott has become a well-known celebrity to the public, as well as the author of an autobiographical book titled Look Out for the Little Guy, which tells a different version of how he helped save the universe from Thanos in Endgame.[9][10]\n- Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp:\nThe daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne who is handed down a similar suit and the Wasp mantle from her mother.[11] She serves as the head of the Pym van Dyne Foundation, which uses the Pym Particles for humanitarian efforts.[12] Lilly said the film would explore how the character deals with her \"fragilities and her vulnerabilities\", continuing from how Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) showed how powerful and capable she was.[10]\n- Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror :A \"time-traveling, multiversal adversary\" trapped in the Quantum Realm who needs Pym Particles to get his ship and a device online that would allow him to go anywhere and when in time.[ 13] [ 14] [ 15] Kang is an alternate-timeline variant of the character He Who Remains , the creator of the Time Variance Authority (TVA), who was introduced in the finale of first season of Loki (2021).[ 13] Kang was described by Loki season one head writer Michael Waldron as the \"next big cross-movie villain\" for the MCU,[ 13] while Quantumania writer Jeff Loveness described Kang as a \"top-tier, A-list Avengers villain\".[ 16] Majors said Kang is different from He Who Remains, who is not in Quantumania , with a shifted psychology, portraying Kang differently from He Who Remains due to the different characters surrounding him and transitioning from a series to a film.[ 17] He was attracted to Kang's \"character and dimensions\" and the potential that presented to him as an actor, noting Kang would be a different type of villain to the MCU than Erik Killmonger and Thanos were,[ 18] as well as the possibility of playing a complex villain about whom everyone has to be careful, akin to Iago in William Shakespeare 's tragedy Othello .[ 19] Loveness wanted to focus on Kang as a human being by exploring his humanity and vulnerability as a \"very lonely\" character before he reaches \"apocalyptic, Avengers-scale heights\". He contrasted this to Thanos by not creating him entirely from computer-generated imagery , and said Kang would be \"Thanos on an exponential level\".[ 16] He also said that because the concept of time travel had already been explored in Endgame , he had to broaden his approach to Kang to focus more on the multiverse , his dimensionality, and his \"limitless freedom\" from his time, and how different versions of the character would destroy it and make it their own.[ 20] Loveness researched the different versions of Kang from the comics such as Rama-Tut and the Scarlet Centurion and described him as an \"infinite snake eating infinite tails\" in being \"a man literally at war against himself\".[ 21] Director Peyton Reed likened the character to Alexander the Great as a reference point for Majors,[ 15] who also found inspiration in Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar . Majors said that Kang would be the \"supervillain of supervillains\" and looked to contrast Tony Stark / Iron Man , who he called the \"superhero of superheroes\".[ 22] Majors added 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of muscle for the role, focusing on strength and conditioning training.[ 18] Reed said Quantumania would show a \"different flavor\" of Majors's approach to Kang's alternate versions and explained that Kang \"has dominion over time\", calling him a warrior, strategist, and \"all-timer antagonist\" compared to the antagonists of the prior Ant-Man films as a \"force of nature\",[ 23] one that adds \"tonal diversity, real conflict and real friction\".[ 15] Given his work with time, Kang does not live a linear life.[ 19]\n    - Majors also portrays numerous Kang variants within the Council of Kangs including Immortus, Rama-Tut, and Centurion in the mid-credits scene, as well as the variant Victor Timely in the post-credits scene.[24][25]\n- Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang:\nScott Lang's 18-year-old daughter who acquires a suit similar to her father's.[9][26] She is scientifically inclined, and gains an interest in Pym's old notes and learning more about the science and technology from the Quantum Realm. Reed said that he wanted to further develop the relationship between Cassie and Scott, as it was central to the previous Ant-Man films.[19] The character was previously portrayed as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in the previous Ant-Man films and as a teenager by Emma Fuhrmann in Endgame.[27]\n- David Dastmalchian as Veb: A slime-like creature that lives in the Quantum Realm whose ooze can make anyone understand Quantum Realm language. Dastmalchian previously portrayed Kurt in the first two Ant-Man films.[28]\n- Katy O'Brian as Jentorra:\nThe human-shaped leader of the Freedom Fighters rebelling against Kang's oppression of the communities in the Quantum Realm.[29][30] O'Brian auditioned for the role, despite previously working with Reed on the Star Wars series The Mandalorian, and originally believed she was auditioning for The Marvels (2023). Despite the character appearing in the comics, O'Brian was encouraged to create the character as she chose.[31] O'Brian previously appeared as Kimball in the Marvel Television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.[32]\n- William Jackson Harper as Quaz: A humanoid telepath who lives in the Quantum Realm.[29]\n- Bill Murray as Lord Krylar:\nThe human-shaped governor of the lavish Axia community in the Quantum Realm,[33] who has a history with Janet van Dyne in the Quantum Realm.[34][35] Reed believed Murray's character represented a person's past \"always find[ing] a way to show up again\" and the film's theme of secrets between family members and how they are each affected by them.[19]\n- Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne / Wasp: Pym's wife, Hope's mother, and the original Wasp, who was lost in the Quantum Realm for 30 years.[36]\n- Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / M.O.D.O.K.:\nPym's former protégé who was shrunken to subatomic size in the Quantum Realm during the events of Ant-Man (2015) and became a mutated, cybernetically enhanced individual with an oversized head known as M.O.D.O.K.[37][9][38] Loveness described the character as a cross between Kevin Kline's Otto West from A Fish Called Wanda (1988) and Frank Grimes from The Simpsons season eight episode \"Homer's Enemy\" (1997). Loveness felt M.O.D.O.K. to be his favorite character in the film because they put a \"little extra\" on him, and said M.O.D.O.K.'s ego would be crumbled throughout the film whenever he is challenged, but like Otto West, easily kills as a \"real loose cannon\".[39]\n- Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym / Ant-Man:\nA former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, entomologist, and physicist who became the original Ant-Man after creating the suit.[11] In the film, Pym was written to be more \"relaxed\" than in previous MCU appearances, as he is more focused on reacquainting with Janet than his work. As a result, Broussard described Pym as \"a little more sure of himself\" and \"not looking around every corner\". Loveness believed that Pym's fascination with ants, a trait only comically referenced previously, was a critical hallmark of the character, and thus decided to expand on it in the film. Broussard felt the expansion was \"a weird thing ... but also awesome ... a bit of an acknowledgment of ... a weird obsession for this guy who's totally owned it.\"[40]\n\nAdditionally, Randall Park briefly reprises his role as FBI agent Jimmy Woo from previous MCU media,[41] along with Gregg Turkington as Baskin-Robbins store manager Dale from Ant-Man.[42] Ruben Rabasa appears as a coffee shop attendant who mistakes Ant-Man for Spider-Man.[34] A man asking Lang for a picture with his dog is played by Mark Oliver Everett, frontman of the rock band Eels, whose father was quantum physicist Hugh Everett III and the originator of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory.[43] Roger Craig Smith and Matthew Wood voice the Quantumnauts, the foot soldiers of Kang.[44] The film's post-credits scene features uncredited cameo appearances by Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson, reprising their respective roles as Loki and Mobius M. Mobius from Loki.[24]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nAhead of the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), director Peyton Reed said there were elements of that film that leave \"a lot to play with\" in a potential third film in the franchise. He highlighted the Quantum Realm, which was introduced in Ant-Man (2015) and explored further in Ant-Man and the Wasp; Reed said they were \"just dipping our toes into it\" for the previous films.[45] Reed added that he and Marvel Studios were hopeful about a third film and had discussed potential story points for such a sequel.[46] In February 2019, Hank Pym actor Michael Douglas confirmed that informal discussions regarding a sequel to Ant-Man and the Wasp had taken place,[47] though by that time Evangeline Lilly had not heard of any plans for her character Hope van Dyne / Wasp following her role in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Lilly stated that \"Hope is mid-journey. I don't see her journey as being over by any stretch.\"[48] That October, Michelle Pfeiffer expressed interest in reprising her role of Janet van Dyne in a sequel,[49] while Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was asked about the future of Paul Rudd's Scott Lang / Ant-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Endgame, and responded that \"the chess pieces were arranged very purposefully\" at the end of that film, with some taken \"off the board\" and others, like Ant-Man, \"still on [the board, so] you never know\".[50] Rudd was asked whether he would be returning to the role, either in a third Ant-Man film or as part of another hero's MCU franchise, and said that both of those options had been discussed.[51]\n\nReed officially signed on to direct a third Ant-Man film at the start of November 2019. Rudd was set to star as Lang,[8] with Lilly and Douglas also returning.[11] Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2021 with a likely release date in 2022.[52][8] Reed was hired again, despite Marvel's interest in new filmmakers bringing different takes to their heroes for each film, because executives felt he had \"a real grasp on the Ant-Man universe and want[ed] to see him return to wrap up his trilogy\".[11] Jeff Loveness was hired to write the script for the film during \"the early days of Hollywood's shutdown\" due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and he had begun working on the screenplay by April 2020. At that point, it was no longer clear when production would begin on the film due to the effects of the pandemic on all film productions.[53] Chris McKenna, Eric Pearson, Rudd, and Erik Sommers received credit for additional off-screen literary material.[54] In August 2020, Reed confirmed that development on the film was continuing during the pandemic. He said that Lilly would continue to get equal billing in the film alongside Rudd as she is \"a very, very important part\" of the partnership between Ant-Man and the Wasp, despite rumors that her role would be reduced following controversial comments about the pandemic. Reed added that the story for the film had been \"cracked\", though \"nothing [was] official yet\",[55] and said the third film would be a \"bigger, more sprawling movie than the first two [with] a very different visual template\".[56] Reed stated they wanted to further explore the Quantum Realm in the film as a \"massive world-building undertaking\", and compared its design to electron microscope photography, the Heavy Metal magazine issues of the 1970s and 1980s and his favorite science fiction cover artists such as Jean Giraud for fantastical realism.[14] Marvel Studios producer Brian Gay said the film would \"feel like a real departure\" from the first two Ant-Man films and be a big adventure.[57] Fellow Marvel Studios executive Stephen Broussard produced the film alongside Feige.[58]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nJonathan Majors was cast as Kang the Conqueror for the film, and the character was subsequently planned as the main antagonist of the Multiverse Saga during production.[59]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJonathan Majors was cast in September 2020 in a \"lead role\" for the film, which was reported to be Kang the Conqueror.[60] Because the actor cast as Kang would first portray an alternate version of the character, named He Who Remains, in the Disney+ series Loki, Kate Herron and Michael Waldron—the director and head writer of Loki's first season, respectively—were involved in casting Majors in addition to Reed and executives at Marvel Studios;[61][13] Marvel Studios were eager to work with and cast Majors after seeing his performance in The Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019), with Reed very supportive of approaching Majors.[62] Majors was approached for the role without an audition,[63] and later noted he had been involved in the film \"since the beginning\" before joining Loki.[17] Reed was interested in having Ant-Man and the Wasp go up against a formidable foe in the film, believing Kang to be one of Marvel Comics' \"all-timers\" like Loki and Doctor Doom.[19]\n\nIn November 2020, filming was expected to start in 2021.[64] The following month, Pfeiffer confirmed her involvement and that filming would begin in mid-2021,[36] while she and Douglas both indicated that the film would be released in 2022.[65][66] Later in December at Disney's Investor Day, Feige revealed the film's title as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, confirmed the return of Rudd, Lilly, Douglas and Pfeiffer, alongside Majors as Kang, and revealed that Kathryn Newton had joined the film as Cassie Lang.[27] Newton originally auditioned for the role of Kate Bishop in the Disney+ miniseries Hawkeye (2021), before Hailee Steinfeld was cast as the character.[67] Emma Fuhrmann, who played the character as a teenager in Avengers: Endgame, was saddened by the announcement of Newton taking over the role, and hoped to be involved in the MCU in the future.[68] Later that month, Loveness revealed that he had turned in the first draft of the script, and said Marvel had used the COVID-19 pandemic break to \"do something new and weird\" with the film.[69] Loveness was inspired by several \"father and daughter\" films starring Steve Martin or Robin Williams from the 1990s, like Father of the Bride, Hook (both 1991) and Jumanji (1995), with Loveness feeling that because he admired all those father characters, he could mix the \"underdog dad\" hero energy with Rudd's likability to make it a through line for the film.[70] Broussard described the film as a \"family adventure\" film that becomes \"an epic sci-fi war movie and a coming-of-age story\".[71]: 2–3\n\nOn February 4, 2021, Turkey's Minister of Culture and Tourism Mehmet Ersoy announced that shooting for the film had begun in the country's region of Cappadocia, with the production also set to film in other parts of Turkey.[72] At the beginning of March, Tip \"T.I.\" Harris was revealed to not be returning as his character Dave from the first two Ant-Man films.[73][74] This news came after sexual abuse allegations against Harris and his wife Tameka Cottle arose at the end of February, but Variety reported that this was unrelated and Harris was never set to return for the sequel.[73] In early May 2021, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on February 17, 2023.[75] In mid-June, Rudd and Douglas headed to England to prepare for filming.[76][77] Shooting to capture exterior shots and background plates took place at the San Francisco Police Department Central Station in North Beach, San Francisco on June 19 and 20, with filming of the station's interior, the outward view of the building, and downtown San Francisco.[78] In July, Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair reported that Corey Stoll, who portrayed Darren Cross / Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, would appear in \"some shape\" for Quantumania.[79] Reed planned to feature comedian Tom Scharpling again in the film, after his cameos in the previous two films were ultimately cut from the theatrical releases; however, the scene in which he would have been featured was cut before it was filmed.[80]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 26, 2021,[81] at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire,[82] using the working title Dust Bunny,[83] with Bill Pope serving as cinematographer.[84] Industrial Light &amp; Magic provided the same StageCraft virtual production technology Reed used while directing episodes of the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian.[82] Will Htay served as the production designer.[85] Principal photography was previously set to begin in January 2021 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[52][53][86] It was then expected to take place between May 31 and September 24.[87] By September 16, over 50 crew members from Pinewood Studios productions, mainly Quantumania and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023), contracted norovirus following an outbreak at the studio. The main cast was not affected.[88] In October, the film's release was delayed to July 28, 2023.[89] Later that month, Bill Murray revealed he had shot material for a Marvel film with Reed, which was believed to be Quantumania. Murray explained he joined the project as he liked Reed and his work on Bring It On (2000), despite not being interested in superhero films,[90] before he further indicated his involvement in the film, but said he could not comment on his prior statement;[91][92] Murray later said he was playing a \"bad guy\" in the film.[35] During the filming process, the screenplay was reportedly still being worked on at the same time, with multiple scenes involving Murray and Katy O'Brian's Jentorra later being scrapped, resulting in Murray's character seemingly dying.[31] Principal photography was completed in November 2021.[93] Filming was also expected to take place in Atlanta,[87] and the production was slated to move to San Francisco in 2022 with the cast.[78]\n\n### Post-production\n\nIn April 2022, the film was moved back to its February 17, 2023, release date, swapping places with The Marvels because Quantumania was further along in production than that film.[94] In September 2022, Randall Park was confirmed to be reprising his role as Jimmy Woo,[41] and Feige called the film \"a direct line\" into Phase Five and the planned Phase Six film Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,[95] with Majors attached to reprise his role in The Kang Dynasty.[19] Reed stated that Quantumania would have a \"profound impact\" on the MCU and that the impact of Kang's appearance in this film was discussed with Loveness for The Kang Dynasty, which he was also writing.[23] Loveness felt that having Kang as the main villain of Quantumania would set up the dynamic story he was developing for The Kang Dynasty.[16] Marvel Studios was not initially planning to have \"The Multiverse Saga\", which comprises Phases Four, Five, and Six, revolve around Kang, but decided to after seeing Majors' performance in the first season of Loki and the dailies while filming Quantumania.[59] Reed also hoped the film would not be viewed as a \"palate cleanser\" the previous two films had been following Avengers films, but would instead feel as big as an Avengers film.[19] Gregg Turkington was also revealed to be reprising his role as Dale, a Baskin-Robbins manager, from Ant-Man.[42] In October 2022, William Jackson Harper was revealed to be appearing in the film in an undisclosed role,[96] and in November, O'Brian was revealed to be appearing in the film alongside David Dastmalchian, who portrayed Kurt in the first two films,[97] after he previously said he was not involved in Quantumania.[98] In January 2023, Dastmalchian, Harper, O'Brian, Murray, and Stoll were revealed to be playing Veb, Quaz, Jentorra, Lord Krylar,[28] and M.O.D.O.K., respectively.[37] Pick-up shots with Rudd occurred by then.[99]\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene sees the introduction of the Council of Kangs, particularly Immortus, Rama-Tut, and Centurion. These variants, all portrayed by Majors, discuss how the Conqueror has been killed and that the Avengers are starting to infringe on the multiverse and what they have built. This leads to hundreds of other Kang variants filling an arena,[25] in a shot reminiscent of the council's first appearance in comics in The Avengers #292 (June 1988).[100] The post-credits scene is footage from the Loki season 2 episode \"1893\" (2023),[100][5][6][7] with Majors appearing as Victor Timely, a Kang variant, and Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson reprising their respective Loki roles of Loki and Mobius M. Mobius.[24][25][5][6][7]\n\n| External videos                                                                                                                                                              | External videos                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Marvel Studios' Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania Main on End Credits Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel | Marvel Studios' Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania Main on End Credits Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel |\n\nThe film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception, which emulated the visuals of the Quantum Realm using fluid motion and microscopic chemical reactions.[101] The visual effects were made by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Digital Domain, Moving Picture Company, Fin Design + Effects, Spin VFX, Rising Sun Pictures, Folks VFX, Barnstorm VFX, Base FX, Pixomondo, MARZ, Luma Pictures, Atomic Arts, Territory Studio, and Stereo D,[102] with Jesse James Chisholm as the visual effects supervisor,[84] while Adam Gerstel and Laura Jennings co-edited the film.[103] Due to the shifting release schedule of the film, the post-production period for Quantumania was reduced by four-and-a-half months, which resulted in reportedly at least 10 rushed visual effects scenes being added at the last minute.[104] Several visual effects companies that worked on Quantumania were also in post-production on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) around the same time, which resulted in \"critical resources\" being diverted to focus on Wakanda Forever.[105] Disney spent $194.7 million during pre-production and filming and an additional $131.9 million on post-production in 2022 for a total gross production budget of $326.6 million, which was over 63% more than an initially estimated $200 million production budget and exceeded that of Disney's internal projections for the budget. Disney also received a total reimbursement from the UK government of $50.6 million, which reduced the net budget to $276 million.[106]\n\nIn March 2023, Marvel Studios filed a request to issue a subpoena to Reddit to identify the person or group who was responsible for leaking the script and subtitle file for the film in January 2023 to the subreddit r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers, as well as a subpoena to Google since the leaked information had been uploaded to Google Docs.[107] As a result of the request, r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers temporarily went private and became unavailable to the public.[108] The subreddit was reopened in July 2023.[109]\n\n## Music\n\nChristophe Beck was revealed to be composing the score by July 2022, after previously working on the previous two Ant-Man films, as well as the MCU Disney+ series WandaVision and Hawkeye (both in 2021).[110] The soundtrack album was released digitally by Hollywood Records and Marvel Music on February 15, 2023,[111] with its first track, \"Theme from Quantumania\", released as a digital single on February 12.[112]\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe first footage from the film was shown at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con where Feige, Reed, and the cast promoted the film and discussed the characters.[9] Further footage was shown at D23 in September, which Ryan Leston at IGN called \"an intriguing glimpse\" into the film.[95] A teaser trailer for the film was released on October 24, 2022. It featured \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton John.[58] Tom Chapman at Den of Geek noted the trailer was \"darker than ever\" compared to the comedic tone of the prior two Ant-Man films and featured \"dramatic pauses and tense musical cues\", but felt it was \"another MCU teaser trailer that does a little too much teasing\" to not reveal key details, such as the absence of the character M.O.D.O.K. who was shown in the D23 footage.[113] Charles Pulliuam-Moore of The Verge compared the trailer to Disney's then-upcoming film Strange World (2022) and highlighted the Quantum Realm's appearance as being \"beautiful and nonsensical\",[114] while Empire's Owen Williams compared the Quantum Realm to Ego's planet from the MCU film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[115]\n\nA new trailer for the film debuted during the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship on January 9 before it was released online. Daniel Chin of The Ringer noted the trailer had revealed \"a lot\" as compared to the teaser one, including the lay out of the film's plot and the first look at M.O.D.O.K. Chin felt the trailer had featured \"some misdirections... but it seems to supply more advance knowledge than Marvel typically dispenses.\"[116] That month, Heineken released a commercial featuring Rudd to promote their non-alcoholic beer and the film.[117] The following month, Volkswagen released a commercial that was directed by Anthony Leonardi III to promote the film and their SUV model ID.4.[118] Additionally, Lang's fictional memoir, Look Out for the Little Guy, was announced to be published by Hyperion Avenue, created alongside Marvel Studios and the filmmakers, and was released on September 5, 2023. It features \"over 20 short pieces exploring different aspects of Scott's experiences\" as a father and Avenger,[119] and was written by Rob Kutner. Loveness wrote the passages that were featured in the film.[120]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania had its world premiere at Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles, on February 6, 2023,[121] and was released in the United States and China on February 17, 2023.[94][122] The film was previously set to be released in 2022,[65][66] before being officially announced as releasing on February 17, 2023, in May 2021.[75] It was delayed to July 28, 2023, in October 2021,[89] and returned to the February 2023 date in April 2022.[94] It is the first film, and start of, Phase Five of the MCU.[123]\n\n### Home media\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital download on April 18, 2023; on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on May 16; and on Disney+ on May 17.[124]\n\nThe film debuted at No. 1 on Vudu's weekly chart for the week ending April 23, 2023, following its digital purchase release on April 18.[125] It later moved to No. 2 on Vudu's chart for the week ending April 30.[126] Upon its release on PVOD, Quantumania reached No. 1 on iTunes.[127] It debuted at No. 1 on the Circana VideoScan First Alert chart for DVD and Blu-ray Disc unit sales for the week ending May 20, 2023. Blu-ray formats accounted for 69% of total unit sales, with 37% from regular Blu-ray and 32% from 4K Ultra HD, making it No. 1 on the dedicated 4K chart as well.[128] In May 2023, Quantumania debuted at No. 1 on the physical disc sales chart, according to Circana's VideoScan tracking service. It was also one of the top-performing films in terms of disc sales throughout the first half of 2023.[129]\n\nNielsen Media Research, which records streaming viewership on certain U.S. television screens, calculated that Quantumania was streamed for 766 million minutes from May 15—21, 2023.[130][131] Analytics company Samba TV, which gathers viewership data from certain smart TVs and content providers, reported that Quantumania was the second most-streamed program from May 17—23, 2023.[132]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania grossed $214.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $261.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $476.1 million.[3][4] It was a box-office disappointment, falling short of its reported break-even point of $600 million,[133] against a gross production budget of $388.4 million.[2] This budget was initially reported to be around $200 million.[134][133]\n\nIn January 2023, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was projected to earn $120 million in North America over the four-day Presidents' Day opening weekend.[135] The following month, it was projected to debut at $105–110 million domestically and $280 million globally in its opening weekend.[136] The film made $46 million on its first day, including $17.5 million from Thursday previews that began at 3 pm. It went on to debut to $106.1 million (and a total of $120.4 million over the four-day frame) from 4,345 theatres, marking the best opening of the Ant-Man series and the third-best for a February release, behind Black Panther ($242.1 million in 2018) and Deadpool ($152.1 million in 2016).[134][3][137] The film's second weekend saw a 69% drop, down to $32 million in North America, the largest second-week domestic drop-off of any Marvel Cinematic Universe film.[138] In its third weekend, the film earned $12.4 million, for a drop of 61%.[139]\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film grossed $121.3 million in its opening weekend.[140] In its second weekend, the film earned $46.4 million, for a drop of 57%, and remained the number one non-local movie in most markets.[141] The film grossed $22 million from 52 markets in its third weekend, for a decline of 53%.[142] The top five international markets were China ($39.4 million), the UK ($23.9 million), Mexico ($18 million), France ($13.6 million), and South Korea ($12.6 million).[143]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 46% with an average rating of 5.5/10, based on 410 reviews. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania mostly lacks the spark of fun that elevated earlier adventures, but Jonathan Majors' Kang is a thrilling villain poised to alter the course of the MCU.\"[144] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 61 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[145] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, and those polled by PostTrak reported 75% of audience members gave the film a positive score, with 60% saying they would definitely recommend it.[137]\n\nOwen Gleiberman from Variety was critical of the film, calling it \"at once fun and numbing\" and stating \"...if this is what Phase 5 looks like, God save us from Phases 6, 7 and 8.\"[146] Caryn James from the BBC stated that the movie has \"Marvel's next big villain but other than that, it has nothing to offer beyond drab-looking action.\"[147] Wendy Ide from The Guardian called Majors's performance the film's \"magnetic core\", but said that overall the film was \"baffling and illogical\".[148] Ross Bonaime from Collider also praised Majors's performance, writing he \"makes for an excellent villain, who brings nuance and subtlety to his character ... Majors makes this character [Kang] likable in the beginning, but also never hides the menace and terror that he can cause at any moment.\" Giving the film a B−, Bonaime stated: \"Quantumania is a promising, but shaky start for Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's just a shame it comes at the sake of the little guy.\"[149] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commended Majors for \"bringing real gravitas\" to the film, and investing \"his performance with such an arrestingly quiet stillness and ambivalence that you're on edge every moment he's onscreen.\" Scheck also praised Pfeiffer, writing she \"is terrific in her expanded role, given the opportunity to be a badass heroine and making the most of it.\"[150] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times felt Pfeiffer, Majors, and Douglas were the \"truer stars of this show\", but felt the overall film was \"busy, noisy and thoroughly uninspired\".[151]\n\nRichard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times rated the film three out of four stars, writing it is a \"mid-tier MCU film, with decent enough battle sequences and some nifty visuals\".[152] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a B+, concluding: \"At just over 120 minutes, though — a blink in Marvel time — this Ant-Man is clever enough to be fun, and wise enough not overstay its welcome. Who better understands the benefits, after all, of keeping it small?\"[153] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, stating it is \"less fun, and blandly garish visually. The earlier films' throwaway jokes and welcome aversion to brutal solemnity have largely been ditched in favor of endless endgame stuff and weirdly cheesy digital world-building in the Quantum Realm.\"[154] Similarly, David Sims of The Atlantic disapprovingly compared the film to the first two entries, writing in his review: \"That cleverness, combined with the special-effect goofiness of people and objects getting big and small, powered the series—and it is basically been junked here, replaced by a bunch of celestial showdowns between Kang and Ant-Man. Anytime Quantumania allows itself to get a little silly, it's in much better shape.\"[155]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania received a nomination for Best Music Supervision in a Trailer – Film at the 2023 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards.[156] At the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards, it was nominated for Best Hero (Rudd) and Best Kick-Ass Cast.[157] The film garnered a nomination for Best Fantasy Adventure TV Spot (for a Feature Film) at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[158][159] The film is also nominated for Best Superhero Film at the 51st Saturn Awards,[160] and for Best Visual Effects or Animation at the 13th AACTA Awards.[161] At the 49th People's Choice Awards, it is nominated for Action Movie of the Year.[162] At the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Supporting Actor for both Douglas and Murray, Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, and Worst Director for Reed.[163]\n\n## Documentary special\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced.[164] The special on this film, \"The Making of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\", was released on Disney+ on July 19, 2023.[165]\n\n## Future\n\nIn February 2023, Broussard said he had started to discuss a potential fourth film with Feige and Reed.[166] Douglas said he would be interested in returning for a fourth film if Pym died in it,[167] but in April 2024 he said \"I don't think I'm going to show up\" for a fourth film because he had requested for Pym to die in Quantumania and was disappointed that this did not happen.[168]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ As depicted in Avengers: Endgame (2019)\n- ^ As depicted in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)\n- ^ As depicted in Ant-Man (2015)\n- ^ As depicted in the Loki season 2 episode \"1893\" (2023)[5][6][7]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Ant-man And The Wasp Quantumania\".

As a result, a relatively boring movie. It felt as though there was so much context to provide there was no time to make it enjoyable. Some exciting parts but this was only attributable to Suzanne Collins' writing; I believe the directors heavily relied on the plot already written for them. Rachel exaggerated jaw acting made this not only a boring watch but a difficult one. Lucy Gray was a textbook manic pixie dream girl - I thought cinema would be more self aware by now.\n\n- claudiabrowne-35545\n- Dec 1, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp;amp; Snakes?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - November 16, 2023 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Canada\n- Official site\n    - Film website\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Los juegos del hambre: Balada de pájaros cantores y serpientes\n- Filming locations\n    - Landschaftspark, Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\n- Production companies\n    - Lionsgate\n    - Color Force\n    - About Blank\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $100,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $166,350,594\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $44,607,143\n    - Nov 19, 2023\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $348,900,019\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 37 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - IMAX 6-Track\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - 12-Track Digital Sound\n    - Auro 11.1\n    - DTS:X\n    - D-Cinema 96kHz 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes (2023)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This novel takes place sixty-four years before the beloved original, The Hunger Games. It introduces new and surprising information about the Capitol, making it easier to understand how Coriolanus Snow became the ruthless President he was in the original series. The book features new, likable characters and numerous twists that keep readers engaged. It is thicker than the original trilogy, with a higher standard of vocabulary, appealing to older fans. Overall, it is rated 8.5/10.",

The novel adds layers to the original series, introducing new meanings behind key elements like mockingjays and 'The Hanging Tree' song. Snow's moral dilemmas and his eventual decisions are pivotal to understanding his character arc. The book leaves room for interpretation, making it a worthwhile read."

To preface, I love the original one from 1996 (the one that actually felt like an intelligent spy thriller and still had pretty phenomenal action set pieces and a singular feat of mindblowing espionage - the NOC list heist) Besides that I really enjoy the third one for its action, plot, supporting cast, and for Philip Seymour Hoffman's genuinely menacing performance as Owen Davian. And I did like the fourth one well enough; the Kremlin stuff is fun and the Burj Khalifa sequence is admittedly amazing.\n\nBut these newer ones, I don't know anymore. I didn't see Rogue Nation and I think I saw Fallout but I can't even remember because it was completely forgettable for me. And this one, Dead Reckoning (sorry, Dead Reckoning PART 1 ...🙄), has to be one of the blandest high budget action films I can remember. Awful dialogue, awful attempts at humor, absolutely no meaningful characterization or character development, rehashed and hollow action spectacles, constant expository dialogue when the plot could be summed up in a few words, flat performances... and everyone of the main team looks old and worn out (especially Tom Cruise). And not to mention the completely unnecessary callbacks to the first movie.\n\nI'm just baffled at the praise this thing is getting. Is it because it's cool to see Tom Cruise riding a motorcycle off a cliff? Well yes ok, that one scene is a little cool. But you have to suffer through the entire rest of the movie that surrounds it. Is it worth it?

            "spanned_content": "The official Sardonicast subreddit\n\n# <Name>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning</Name>... awful\n\nI just saw the new <Name>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning</Name> movie and it was one of the worst movies I've seen all year. To preface, I love the original one from 1996 (the one that actually felt like an intelligent spy thriller and still had pretty phenomenal action set pieces and a singular feat of mindblowing espionage - the NOC list heist). Besides that, I really enjoy the third one for its <Genre>action</Genre>, <Plot Complexity>plot</Plot Complexity>, supporting cast, and for <Main Characters>Philip Seymour Hoffman's</Main Characters> genuinely menacing performance as <Main Characters>Owen Davian</Main Characters>. And I did like the fourth one well enough; the Kremlin stuff is fun and the Burj Khalifa sequence is admittedly amazing.\n\nBut these newer ones, I don't know anymore. I didn't see <Name>Rogue Nation</Name> and I think I saw <Name>Fallout</Name> but I can't even remember because it was completely forgettable for me. And this one, <Name>Dead Reckoning</Name> (sorry, <Name>Dead Reckoning PART 1</Name> ...🙄), has to be one of the blandest high-budget <Genre>action</Genre> films I can remember. Awful dialogue, awful attempts at <Humor Level>humor</Humor Level>, absolutely no meaningful characterization or character development, rehashed and hollow action spectacles, constant expository dialogue when the plot could be summed up in a few words, flat performances... and everyone of the main team looks old and worn out (especially <Main Characters>Tom Cruise</Main Characters>). And not to mention the completely unnecessary callbacks to the first movie.\n\nI'm just baffled at the praise this thing is getting. Is it because it's cool to see <Main Characters>Tom Cruise</Main Characters> riding a motorcycle off a cliff? Well yes ok, that one scene is a little cool. But you have to suffer through the entire rest of the movie that surrounds it. Is it worth it? To essentially watch a 2 hour 40 minute long (ridiculously un-earned runtime btw!!) excuse for <Main Characters>Tom Cruise</Main Characters> to do extreme sports in the guise of a poorly conceived and executed (to paraphrase <Main Characters>Laurence Fishburne</Main Characters> in <Name>MI:3</Name>) spy plot?\n\nThere's a lot more I could say about how much better the first, third, and somewhat the fourth films in this franchise are and why the new ones (which I have since learned are all directed by <Director>Christopher McQuarrie</Director>...) suck balls but I think I've made my point.

Known for blockbusters with complex storytelling produced for Hollywood studios, he is considered a leading filmmaker of the 21st century. Nolan's films have earned over $6.6 billion worldwide, making him the seventh-highest-grossing film director. His accolades include two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and two British Academy Film Awards. Nolan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2019, and received a knighthood in 2024 for his contributions to film.\n\nNolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, Memento (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002). He became a high-profile director with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012), and found further success with The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017). After the release of Tenet (2020), Nolan parted ways with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, and signed with Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller Oppenheimer (2023), which won him Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.\n\nNolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.\n\n## Early life\n\nChristopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive of Irish descent[1] who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, was an American flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three brothers were raised Catholic in Highgate and would spend their summers in Evanston.[2][3] Nolan also spent time living in Chicago during his youth, and he holds both UK and US citizenship.[4][5]\n\nNolan attended University College London and used its Flaxman Gallery for a scene in Inception (2010).[6]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Sir Ridley Scott and the science fiction films 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977).[7][8] He would repeatedly watch the latter film and extensively research its making.[9] Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[10] These films included a stop motion animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from \"clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls\".[7] His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: \"I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice\", Nolan later remarked.[11] From the age of 11, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.[12] Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Witley, Surrey.[13] In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co-directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service.[a][15][16] After a fan posted a copy of Tarantella online, in 2021, Nolan's production company filed a copyright infringement claim, to have the film removed.[17]\n\nNolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later studied English literature at University College London (UCL). Opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued \"a degree in something unrelated\", which his father suggested \"gives a different take on things\".[18] He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16 mm film cameras.[19] Nolan was president of the Union's Film Society,[19] and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened feature films in 35mm during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers.[20]\n\n## Career\n\n### 1993–2003: Early career and breakthrough\n\nAfter earning his bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator and director of corporate films and industrial films.[19][21][22] He directed, wrote and edited the short film Larceny (1996),[23] which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew.[15][24] Funded by Nolan and shot with the UCL Union Film society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.[25] For unknown reasons, the film has since been removed from public view.[23] Nolan filmed a third short, Doodlebug (1997), about a man seemingly chasing an insect with his shoe, only to discover that it is a miniature of himself.[18][26]\n\nNolan and Thomas first attempted to make a feature in the mid-1990s titled Larry Mahoney, which they scrapped.[27] During this period in his career, Nolan had little to no success getting his projects off the ground, facing several rejections; he added, \"[T]here's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place ... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry.\"[28]\n\nShortly after abandoning Larry Mahoney, Nolan conceived the idea for his first feature, Following (1998), which he wrote, directed, photographed and edited. The film depicts an unemployed young writer (Jeremy Theobald) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. It was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his apartment burgled; he observed that the common attribute between larceny and pursuing someone through a crowd was that they both cross social boundaries.[29] Co-produced by Nolan with Thomas and Theobald,[30] it was made on a budget of around £3,000. Most of the cast and crew were friends of Nolan, and shooting took place on weekends over the course of a year.[31] To conserve film stock, each scene was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit.[18][32] Following won several awards during its festival run and was well-received by critics who labelled Nolan a majorly talented debutant.[33][34] Scott Timberg of New Times LA wrote that it \"echoed Hitchcock classics\", but was \"leaner and meaner\".[35] Janet Maslin of The New York Times was impressed with its \"spare look\" and \"agile hand-held camerawork\", saying, \"As a result, the actors convincingly carry off the before, during and after modes that the film eventually, and artfully, weaves together.\"[36]\n\n\"The difference between shooting Following with a group of friends wearing our own clothes and my mum making sandwiches to spending $4 million of somebody else's money on Memento and having a crew of a hundred people is, to this day, by far the biggest leap I've ever made.\"\n\nFollowing's success afforded Nolan the opportunity to make Memento (2000), which became his breakthrough film. His brother Jonathan pitched the idea to him, about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Jonathan worked the idea into a short story, \"Memento Mori\" (2001), and Nolan developed it into a screenplay that told the story in reverse. Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was \"perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen\".[38] The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5 million, with Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss in the starring roles.[39] Newmarket also distributed the film after it was rejected by studios who feared that it would not attract a wide audience. Following a positive word of mouth and screenings in 500 theatres, it earned $40 million.[40] Memento premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2000 to critical acclaim.[41] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote in his review, \"I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.\"[42] In the book The Philosophy of Neo-Noir, Basil Smith drew a comparison with John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities – a theme Nolan explores in the film.[43] Memento earned Nolan many accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, as well as two Independent Spirit Awards: Best Director and Best Screenplay.[44][45] Six critics listed it as one of the best films of the 2000s.[46] In 2001, Nolan and Emma Thomas founded the production company Syncopy Inc.[47][b]\n\nImpressed by his work on Memento, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh recommended Nolan to Warner Bros. to direct the psychological thriller Insomnia (2002), although the studio initially wanted a more seasoned director.[49] A remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name, the film is viewed as \"the outlier of Nolan's filmography\" due to its perceived lack of unconventionality he is known for.[50] Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank,[51] Insomnia follows two Los Angeles detectives sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager. It received positive reviews from critics and earned $113 million against a budget of $46 million.[52][53] Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt, adding, \"Unlike most remakes, the Nolan Insomnia is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play.\"[54] Richard Schickel of Time deemed Insomnia a \"worthy successor\" to Memento and \"a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery\".[55]\n\nFollowing, Memento and Insomnia established Nolan's image as an \"auteur\".[56] After the lattermost, he wrote a screenplay for a Howard Hughes biopic. Nolan reluctantly tabled his script after learning that Martin Scorsese was already making one such film: The Aviator (2004).[57] He was then briefly attached to direct a film adaptation of Ruth Rendell's novel The Keys to the Street for Fox Searchlight Pictures but chose to direct Batman Begins instead.[58] Nolan turned down an offer to direct the historical epic Troy (2004).[59] In April 2003, filmmaker David O. Russell put Nolan in a headlock at a Hollywood party after learning that Jude Law, whom Russell wanted to cast, had decided to work with Nolan instead. Russell pressured Nolan to display \"artistic solidarity\" by relinquishing Law from his cast.[60][61]\n\n### 2003–2013: Widespread recognition\n\nIn early 2003, Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the idea of making a new Batman film, based on the character's origin story.[62] Nolan was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world than a comic-book fantasy.[63] He relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects during filming, with minimal use of computer-generated imagery (CGI).[64] Batman Begins (2005), the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point,[65] was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.[66][67] Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman—along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson—Batman Begins revived the franchise.[68][69] Batman Begins was 2005's ninth-highest-grossing film and was praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance;[67][70] it is cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s.[71] Film author Ian Nathan wrote that within five years of his career, Nolan \"[went] from unknown to indie darling to gaining creative control over one of the biggest properties in Hollywood, and (perhaps unwittingly) fomenting the genre that would redefine the entire industry\".[72]\n\nNolan directed, co-wrote and produced The Prestige (2006), an adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel about two rival 19th-century magicians.[73] The screenplay was the result of an intermittent, five-year collaboration between him and his brother Jonathan, who had begun writing it already in 2001. Nolan initially intended to make the film as early as 2003, but had postponed the project after agreeing to make Batman Begins.[74][75] Starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the lead roles of rival magicians, The Prestige received critical acclaim and received two Academy Award nominations.[76][77] Roger Ebert described it as \"quite a movie – atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic\",[78] and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it an \"ambitious, unnerving melodrama\".[79] The Guardian's Philip French wrote: \"In addition to the intellectual or philosophical excitement it engenders, The Prestige is gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny.\"[80] Despite a negative box-office prognosis, the film earned over $109 million against a budget of $40 million.[81]\n\nNolan (left) with the cast and crew of The Dark Knight at the 2008 European premiere in London\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008), the follow-up to Batman Begins, was Nolan's next venture. Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[82] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\".[83] Continuing to minimise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[84][85] The Dark Knight has been ranked as one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever made.[c] Many critics declare The Dark Knight to be \"the most successful comic book film ever made\".[90] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times found the film to be of higher artistic merit than many Hollywood blockbusters: \"Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.\"[91] Ebert expressed a similar point of view, describing it as a \"haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy\".[92] The Dark Knight set many box-office records during its theatrical run,[93] earning over $1 billion worldwide.[94] At the 81st Academy Awards, the film was nominated in eight categories, winning two: Best Sound Editing for Richard King and a posthumous Best Supporting Actor award for Heath Ledger.[95] The film's failure to garner a Best Picture nomination was criticised by the media. Beginning in 2010, the Academy increased their Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as \"The Dark Knight Rule\".[96] Nolan received many awards and nominations for his work on the film.[44] In the late 2000s, Nolan was reported to direct a film adaptation of the 1960s television series The Prisoner.[58][97]\n\nThe success of The Dark Knight allowed Warner Bros. to sign Nolan to write, direct and co-produce Inception (2010) – a film for which he had the idea around nine years before its release.[98] Nolan described the film as \"a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind\".[99] Starring a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film became a critical and commercial success upon its release.[100] Film critic Mark Kermode named it the best film of 2010, stating \"Inception is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing.\"[101] Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[102] The film grossed over $836 million worldwide.[103] Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[104] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[44]\n\nNolan at the 2013 premiere of Man of Steel in London\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism.\"[105] After initial hesitation, Nolan agreed to return to direct The Dark Knight Rises and worked with his brother and David S. Goyer to develop a story that he felt would end the trilogy on a high note.[106] The film was released to positive reviews.[107] Kenneth Turan found the film \"potent, persuasive and hypnotic\" and \"more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard\".[108] Christy Lemire of HuffPost wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a \"typically spectacular, ambitious fashion\", but disliked the \"overloaded\" story and excessive grimness.[109] The Dark Knight Rises was a box office success, becoming the thirteenth film to gross $1 billion.[110] During a midnight showing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.[111] Nolan released a statement expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a \"senseless tragedy\".[112]\n\nThe Dark Knight trilogy inspired a trend in future superhero films seeking to replicate its gritty, realistic tone to little success. The second instalment in particular revitalised the genre at a time when recent superhero films had failed to meet expectations.[113][114] Ben Child of The Guardian wrote that the three films \"will remain thrilling totems of the genre for decades to come\".[113] During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises, Goyer told Nolan of his idea about Man of Steel (2013), which the latter would produce.[115] Impressed with Zack Snyder's work in 300 (2006) and Watchmen (2009), Nolan hired him to direct the film.[116] Starring Henry Cavill as Clark Kent who learns that he is a powerful alien, Man of Steel received mixed reviews and grossed more than $660 million against a budget of $220 million.[117][118]\n\n### 2014–2019: Interstellar, Dunkirk and other activities\n\nNolan and his younger brother, Jonathan (pictured in 2017), wrote several screenplays together, including that of Interstellar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNolan next directed, wrote and produced the science-fiction film Interstellar (2014). The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg.[119] Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.[120] In a 2014 discussion of the film's physics, Nolan expressed his admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied \"in every aspect of our civilisation\".[121] Interstellar – starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain – was released to positive reviews and grossed $773 million worldwide.[122][123] Observing its \"visual dazzle, thematic ambition\", The New York Times's A. O. Scott wrote that Interstellar is a \"sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret\".[124] Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers called the film \"a real work of art\" and praised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations.[125] Interstellar was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two academic papers.[126][127] The American Journal of Physics called for it to be shown in school science lessons.[128][129] At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominations.[130] Also in 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas served as executive producers on Transcendence, the directorial debut of his longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister.[131]\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Nolan took part in several ventures for film preservation and distribution of the work of lesser-known filmmakers. His production company, Syncopy, formed a joint venture with Zeitgeist Films to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist's films.[132] As a part of the Blu-ray release of the animation films of the Brothers Quay, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay (2015). He initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' In Absentia, The Comb and Street of Crocodiles. IndieWire wrote that the brothers \"will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that The Quay Brothers in 35mm will always be one of [the] latter's most important contributions to cinema\".[133][134] An advocate for the survival of the analogue medium, Nolan and visual artist Tacita Dean invited representatives from leading American film archives, laboratories and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled Reframing the Future of Film at the Getty Museum in March 2015.[135][136] Subsequent events were held at Tate Modern in London, Museo Tamayo in Mexico City and Tata Theatre in Mumbai.[137] In April 2015, Nolan joined the board of directors of The Film Foundation, a non-profitable organisation dedicated to film preservation,[138] and was appointed, along with Martin Scorsese, by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board as DGA representatives.[139] Nolan serves on the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund Board of Governors.[140]\n\nAfter serving as an executive producer on Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017),[141][142] Nolan returned to directing with Dunkirk (2017). Based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with Thomas, the film is set amid World War II in 1940 and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a \"sensory, almost experimental movie\" with minimal dialogue.[143] He said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film but with an American budget.[144] Before filming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, \"knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama\".[145] Starring an ensemble cast,[146] Dunkirk was released to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results.[147][148][149] It grossed over $526 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time.[150] In his review, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie.\"[151] The film received many accolades, including Nolan's first Oscar nomination for Best Director.[152]\n\nNolan (right) with Keir Dullea, Katharina Kubrick, Ron Sanders and Jan Harlan at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2018, Nolan supervised a new 70 mm print of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), made from the original camera negative; he presented it at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.[153] USA Today observed that festival-goers greeted Nolan \"like a rock star with a standing ovation\".[154] A year later, Nolan and Thomas received executive producer credits on The Doll's Breath (2019), an animated short directed by the Quay brothers.[155]\n\n### 2020–present: Tenet, Oppenheimer and The Odyssey\n\nNolan's next film was the science fiction film Tenet (2020), described by Tom Shone of The Sunday Times as \"a globe-spinning riff on all things Nolanesque\".[156] Nolan had worked on the screenplay for more than five years after deliberating about its central ideas for over a decade.[157] Delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tenet was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theatres after the pandemic shutdown.[158] The film tells the story of an unnamed protagonist (played by John David Washington) who travels through time to stop a world-threatening attack.[159] It grossed $363 million worldwide on a production budget of $200 million, becoming Nolan's first to underperform at the box-office.[160] Tenet was described as his most polarising film; critics praised the ambition and technical aspects but found its story confusing.[161][152] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded it five out of five, calling it \"a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility—but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination\".[162] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \"a chilly, cerebral film—easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity\".[163] At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Production Design.[164] Following the release of Tenet, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.[165] He served as an executive producer on Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021), a director's cut of 2017's Justice League.[166]\n\nNolan at BFI Southbank in 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNolan's 12th film was Oppenheimer (2023), a biopic based on J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atom bomb.[167] It was Nolan's first R-rated film since Insomnia (2002).[168] The film was financed and distributed by Universal Pictures, making it Nolan's first feature film since Memento that was not made for Warner Bros. He disagreed with Warner Bros.' decision to simultaneously release their films in theatres and on HBO Max.[169] Nolan secured the deal with Universal after he was promised a production budget of around $100 million with an equal marketing budget, total creative control, 20 per cent of first-dollar gross, a 100-day theatrical window and a blackout period from the studio wherein the company would not release another film three weeks before or after Oppenheimer's release.[170] The film received critical acclaim.[171] Matthew Jackson of The A.V. Club wrote, \"Oppenheimer deserves the title of masterpiece. It's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain.\"[172] Terming it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", BBC Culture's Caryn James added that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of Memento, Inception and Tenet.[173] Oppenheimer grossed over $975 million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2023.[174] Among the film's numerous accolades,[175][176] Nolan won the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.[177]\n\nAs of February 2025, Nolan will once again work with Universal Studios on The Odyssey, an adaptation of the Ancient Greek epic poem the Odyssey by Homer. It is scheduled to be released in July 2026.[178] It follows Odysseus (portrayed by Matt Damon), the legendary Greek king of Ithaca, on his perilous journey to return home following the Trojan War, his encounters with the cyclops Polyphemus, the Sirens, and the witch goddess Circe, and his reunion with his wife, Penelope.[179] With an estimated production budget of $250 million, it is poised to be the most expensive film of Nolan's career.[180]\n\n## Personal life and public image\n\nNolan and his wife Emma Thomas in January 2011. Thomas has worked as a producer on all of Nolan's films since 1997.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19.[12][20] She has worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997.[47][181] The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles.[182]\n\nNolan prefers to maintain a certain level of mystery about his work.[183] Refusing to discuss his personal life,[184] he feels that too much biographical information about a filmmaker detracts from the experience of his audiences. He stated, \"I actually don't want people to have me in mind at all when they're watching the films.\"[183] He does not own a smartphone or have an email address, preferring to hand-deliver his scripts to actors instead and have his wife handle outreach with producers and distributors.[185]\n\n## Filmmaking style\n\nNolan's films are largely centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and personal identity.[186][187] His work is characterised by mathematically inspired ideas and images, unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and sound.[d] Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan \"an emotional mathematician\".[192] BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz described him as \"an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning\".[193] Joseph Bevan wrote, \"His films allow arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot conceits.\"[105] Nolan views himself as \"an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system\".[194]\n\n\"Christopher Nolan doesn't make sense. And that is exactly how he likes it. In twenty-three years and through twelve films, he has defied the laws of Hollywood by creating startling, original genre pieces that have revelled in their own complexity, confounding every maxim by which the studios hope to appeal to the widest audience. And yet he does that too. Cinemas fill on the possibility of the next Nolan film. Whatever form it might take.\"\n\nIn the sixteen-essay book The Philosophy of Christopher Nolan, professional philosophers and writers analysed Nolan's work; they identified themes of self-destruction, the nature and value of the truth, and the political mindset of the hero and villain, among others.[196] Robbie B. H. Goh, a professor of English literature, described Nolan as a \"philosophical filmmaker\" who includes philosophical ideas—existentialism, morality, epistemology and the distinction between appearance and reality—in films that frequently portray suspense, action and violence. Goh appreciated his ability to incorporate such themes in films that possess \"elements of the Hollywood blockbuster\"—which help keep the audiences engaged—but simultaneously remain \"more thoughtful and self-reflexive than the typical consumerist action film\".[197] He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \"a wide range of genres and settings\" and \"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\".[198]\n\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \"experimental impulses\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\".[199] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[200][201] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that Nolan \"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \"a largely computer-generated art form\".[201] Because of Nolan's deep involvement in the technical facet of his films, Stuart Joy described him as a \"complete filmmaker\", who \"oversees all aspects of production while also managing cultural and industrial factors outside of the text\".[202]\n\n## Recognition\n\nNolan has made some of the most influential and popular films of his time.[e] Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades,[46][207][208] and according to The Wall Street Journal, his \"ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry\".[209] His films have earned more than $6 billion.[210] Nolan's films Memento and The Dark Knight have been selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant.[211][212] These films and Inception appeared in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and The Hollywood Reporter's poll of best films ever made.[213][214] In 2017, The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar featured in Empire magazine's poll of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\".[215] In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter listed Nolan as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment and described him as a \"franchise unto himself\".[216] Parade ranked Nolan number eight in its 2022 list of 75 Best Movie Directors of All Time.[217]\n\nTwo of Nolan's films (Memento and The Dark Knight) have been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.[211][212]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNolan's work has been as \"intensely embraced, analysed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics\".[184][218] Calling him \"a persuasively inventive storyteller\", Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute named Nolan one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. Andrew wrote that Nolan's films are \"not so much [notable] for their considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair as for their brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions\".[219] David Bordwell observed that Nolan is \"considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers\", citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim and popularity among cinemagoers.[199][220] In 2008, Philip French deemed Nolan \"the first major talent to emerge this century\".[221] Mark Kermode complimented Nolan for bringing \"the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking and apply[ing] them to Hollywood blockbusters. He's living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable\".[222] The Observer's Ryan Gilbey described Nolan as a \"skillful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais\".[223] Mark Cousins applauded Nolan for embracing big ideas, \"Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas—but not Christopher Nolan\".[224] Scott Foundas of Variety declared Nolan \"the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation\",[225] and Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae\".[226]\n\nNolan has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and his work has influenced them.[227][228][229] Kenneth Branagh called Nolan's approach to large-scale filmmaking \"unique in modern cinema\", adding, \"regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. I think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera.\"[230] Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his \"singular vision\" and credited with \"invent[ing] the post-heroic superhero\".[231] Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, \"People talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work.\"[232] Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating \"beautifully made films on a big scale\".[233]\n\nDamien Chazelle lauded Nolan for his ability \"to make the most seemingly impersonal projects—superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders—feel deeply personal\".[234] Discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's Dark Knight series as an example of both;[235] he has described Memento and Inception as \"masterworks\".[236] Denis Villeneuve was impressed by Nolan's ability \"to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope ... To bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now—it's very rare. Every movie that he comes out with, I have more admiration for his work.\"[237] James Cameron expressed disappointment that Nolan was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director for Inception, calling it \"the most astounding piece of film creation and direction of the year, hands down\".[236]\n\n## Filmography\n\n- Following (1998)\n- Memento (2000)\n- Insomnia (2002)\n- Batman Begins (2005)\n- The Prestige (2006)\n- The Dark Knight (2008)\n- Inception (2010)\n- The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n- Interstellar (2014)\n- Dunkirk (2017)\n- Tenet (2020)\n- Oppenheimer (2023)\n- The Odyssey (2026); filming\n\n## Awards and honours\n\nNolan's hand and shoeprints in front of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNolan has been nominated for eight Academy Awards (winning two), eight British Academy Film Awards (winning two) and six Golden Globe Awards (winning one).[44][238][239][240] From 2011 to 2014, he appeared in Forbes Celebrity 100 list based on his income and popularity.[241] Nolan appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.[242]\n\nNolan was named an Honorary Fellow of UCL in 2006,[243] and conferred an honorary doctorate in literature in 2017.[244] In 2012, he became the youngest director to receive a hand-and-footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[245]  He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to film.[246] In 2023, he was awarded the Federation of American Scientists' Public Service Award for his depiction of scientists in his film Oppenheimer.[247] In 2024, Nolan received the British Film Institute Fellowship in recognition of his \"extraordinary achievements and enormous contribution to cinema,\"[248] and the Honorary César award from the Académie des Arts et Techniques du Cinéma for \"continually push[ing] the boundaries of storytelling.\"[249] In March 2024, Nolan was made a knight bachelor for his contributions to film, while his wife Emma Thomas was honoured with a damehood.[250][251]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of Academy Award winners and nominees from Great Britain\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Nolan has continued his collaboration with the Belic brothers, receiving a credit for his editorial assistance on their Oscar-nominated documentary Genghis Blues (1999).[14]\n- ^ The name of the company is derived from syncope, a medical term for fainting.

I made a post a few days ago about how T3 had ruined the franchise on account of it being the first major dip in quality in the series and permanently fracturing the Terminator legacy, but that was before I sat through the two hour long insult to my intelligence that was Terminator Genisys. I put off watching this movie for years because I knew it was bad, but holy shit I had no idea it was THIS bad. The moment Sarah Conner swiftly killed off the original T-800 with a single shot I knew I was in for some absolute bullshit. T3 and Salvation are objectively not good films, but by comparison are masterpiece works of art next to this abject failure of a motion picture. Without having seen Dark Fate I can comfortably say Genisys is the worst Terminator movie, because there is absolutely no way DF can be worse. It’s simply impossible. This is not a Terminator film, but an absolute mockery of the original and a disgrace to the series overall. 1/10. Do better."

            "Plot Complexity": "Naked is a 1993 British black comedy drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh and starring David Thewlis as Johnny, a loquacious intellectual, philosopher and conspiracy theorist. The film won several awards, including Best Director and Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. Naked marked a new career high for Leigh as a director and made the then-unknown Thewlis an internationally recognised star. In a Manchester alley, Johnny is having sex with a woman, who initially encourages him but then protests that he is hurting her, pushes him away, and runs off vowing that \"her Bernard\" will get vengeance on him for this. Johnny grabs his things from his apartment, steals a car, and flees to Dalston, a \"scrawny, unpretentious area\" in east London. He seeks refuge at the home of Louise, a former girlfriend from Manchester, who is not happy to see him. Louise works as a file clerk and lives with two flatmates, the unemployed Sophie, whom she calls her \"hippy-dippy friend\", and the primary tenant Sandra, a nurse who is away in Zimbabwe. Johnny seduces Sophie while treating Louise coldly, but soon tires of her. He leaves and walks around central London, expounding his world view at length to anyone who will listen. Among the people he meets are Archie, a young Scottish man looking for his girlfriend Maggie on Brewer Street, and Brian, a security guard who looks after an empty office building at night, which Johnny calls \"the most tedious job in England\", while planning to move to a seaside cottage in the future. After pursuing a drunk woman and rejecting her when he notices a skull and crossbones tattoo on her shoulder, Johnny follows a young cafe worker home but is thrown out when she starts crying. He hitches a ride with a man hanging posters around town until the man, exasperated by Johnny's nonstop haranguing, throws him down in the street and kicks him before driving off with Johnny's duffel bag containing his clothes and books. Johnny wanders the streets and is severely beaten by a wandering gang of thugs. He returns to Louise's residence to find that their landlord Jeremy (aka Sebastian), a psychopathic and amoral yuppie and rapist, has let himself into the apartment. Jeremy raped Sophie and dropped several hundred pounds for her 'services'. Sophie is desperate to get Jeremy out of the house, but she and Louise fear the police will not help. They try to keep the injured Johnny quiet, but he has a fit that awakens the sleeping Jeremy. Sandra returns early from her trip. Though horrified by the state of the apartment, she tends to Johnny's injuries. Louise drives Jeremy from the house by feigning interest in him but then pulling a knife on him. Feeling desolate and rejected, Sophie flees the house with her few possessions. Louise and Johnny seemingly reconcile and discuss returning to Manchester together, but once she leaves for work, Johnny steals the money and hobbles out into the streets.",

In fact, while we’re on the subject, another thing that really gets on my cinematic tits are movies featuring impassive-faced heroes pulling off ludicrous gymnastics that choked up the blockbuster scene in the wake of The Matrix. So you can imagine how stoked I must have been when trying to stir up enthusiasm to make it through Æon Flux, a relentlessly awful adaptation of the MTV animated series of the same name that spends the entirety of its runtime doing everything in its power to make you hate it with the fire of a thousand suns.",

By 2415, humans, numbering a mere five million, have gathered to live within the walled city-state known as Bregna which is run by a Congress of scientists. Although the place is kind of nice for a dystopian city located on an inhospitable earth, there are numerous reports of mysterious disappearances and the population is plagued by nightmares. Because this is a future dystopian movie, we meet Æon Flux, a cat-suited warrior for the rebel organisation known as the Monicans, whose successful mission to take out a surveillance station is marred by the fact that her beloved sister was mistakenly murdered while under suspicion of being an agent for the resistance. Consumed with vengeance, Æon takes a mission to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild, but like every movie similar to this that's ever been made, not only is there a mystery villain out there pulling everybody’s strings, but Æon has a hidden past that’s linked directly into the growing mental issues the people of Bregna are suffering from.",
