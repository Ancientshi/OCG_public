The film stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as depressed men in their thirties who seek to relive their college days by starting a fraternity, and the tribulations they encounter in doing so. The film was released on February 21, 2003, received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $87 million worldwide.\n\n## Plot\n\nReturning home early from a business trip, real estate attorney Mitch Martin walks in on his girlfriend Heidi hosting an orgy and breaks up with her. At his friend Frank's wedding, Mitch makes an awkward impression on his high school crush, Nicole, and soon moves into a house near Harrison University campus in upstate New York.\n\nMitch's friend Bernard throws a hugely successful housewarming party dubbed Mitch-A-Palooza. A drunken Frank is seen streaking by his wife Marissa and her friends, straining their new marriage, while Mitch wakes up in bed with Darcie, a young woman he later learns is his boss' daughter and a high school senior. Kicked out by Marissa after an unfortunate couple's therapy session, Frank moves in with Mitch.\n\nThe friends are visited by an acquaintance they used to ridicule: Gordon Pritchard, now the college dean, who has had the house rezoned exclusively for campus housing. Exploiting a university loophole, Bernard turns the house into a fraternity open to anyone, and the friends carry out hazing events throughout campus, much to Pritchard's displeasure.\n\nMitch walks in on Nicole's boyfriend, Mark, kissing a woman at a birthday party for one of Bernard's children. Elderly World War II-veteran fraternity brother Blue dies of a heart attack during a \"KY lube wrestling\" match with two college girls at his birthday celebration, and Marissa asks Frank for a divorce.\n\nPritchard bribes student council president Megan Huang, promising to get her into Columbia Law School in exchange for revoking the fraternity's charter. Nicole confronts Mitch after Mark lies that he caught Mitch with the woman at the party instead, and a run-in with Darcie complicates Mitch's attempt to explain. Pritchard has the fraternity evicted, placing the students in the now unsanctioned fraternity at risk of expulsion.\n\nMitch determines they can bypass Pritchard's ruling if all members complete various assessments to prove their legitimacy. Frank defeats James Carville in a debate session, and the fraternity cheats their way through an exam with the help of Mitch's co-workers. In the school spirit evaluation, the fraternity loses points when Frank, dressed as the school mascot, unsuccessfully jumps through a ring of fire.\n\nMegan confronts Pritchard for reneging their deal, and the fraternity faces their final athletics challenge. A badly burned Frank gives an intense rhythmic gymnastics performance, Bernard manages to complete the rings routine, and Weensie, an obese member chosen by Pritchard, executes a perfect vault landing. The fraternity triumphs, but Pritchard gives them a failing score by accounting for the absence of the late Blue. Megan provides a tape recording of Pritchard admitting to bribery, and after a chase across campus, Frank recovers the tape.\n\nPritchard is fired, and the fraternity's charter is reinstated. They move into Pritchard's former residence. Nicole visits Mitch as he leaves the old fraternity house, revealing that she dumped Mark after catching him cheating. They reconcile, Mitch and Bernard returning to their everyday lives while Frank assumes fraternity leadership.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Mark drives off a bridge and lands on a fly-fishing Pritchard as the car explodes. Frank meets Heidi, who invites him to a \"get-together,\" and he enthusiastically accepts.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Luke Wilson as Mitch \"The Godfather\" Martin\n- Will Ferrell as Frank \"The Tank\" Ricard\n- Vince Vaughn as Bernard \"Beanie\" Campbell\n- Jeremy Piven as Dean Gordon \"Cheese\" Pritchard\n- Ellen Pompeo as Nicole\n- Juliette Lewis as Heidi\n- Leah Remini as Lara Campbell\n- Perrey Reeves as Marissa Jones\n- Craig Kilborn as Mark\n- Patrick Fischler as Michael\n- Sara Tanaka as Megan Huang\n- Sarah Shahi as Erica\n- Simon Helberg as Jerry\n- Seann William Scott as Peppers\n- Elisha Cuthbert as Darcie Goldberg\n- Patrick J.

The success of Road Trip prompted Armstrong and Phillips to pitch Reitman on a fraternity-themed film centered around adult men instead of the usual college-aged kids. Said Armstrong, \"There's a weird brotherhood that happens when you're in college were you're kind of finding yourself, and it was funny to think of old people doing it.\"[2]\n\nOld School was filmed in and around La Crescenta, California from January 7, 2002 until March 18, 2002. Filming locations included Palisades High School, UCLA, USC and Harvard University.[3][4] The film is considered a forerunner to the Frat Pack since three of its stars—Ferrell, Vaughn, and Wilson—are core members of that group.[5]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOld School received mixed to positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 167 critics, with an average score of 5.7/10. The website's consensus states, \"While not consistently funny, the movie does have its moments.\"[6] On Metacritic, it has a score of 54 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\".[7] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on a scale of A to F.[8]\n\nElvis Mitchell of The New York Times called it a \"sloppy, dumb, though occasionally funny comedy,\" comparing it to \"a half-empty glass of Coke that's been sitting out for a couple of days; sure, it looks like cola, but one sip tells you exactly what's missing.\"[9] He called out both Phillips and co-executive producer Ivan Reitman for rehashing their previous works and accused the latter of self-plagiarism by saying that the film was \"so derivative of Animal House (and, more specifically, its children) that it's like one of those by-the-numbers imitative movies Homer Simpson is so obsessed with.\"[9] Mitchell added that Phillips \"comes even closer than Mr. Reitman to stealing from himself.\"[9] Mitchell praised Ferrell for using \"his hilarious, anxious zealotry to sell the part\" and Cuthbert who \"hijacks the handful of scenes she has.\"[9]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film one out of four stars and stated, \"This is not a funny movie, although it has a few good scenes and some nice work by Ferrell as an apparently compulsive nudist.\"[10] Variety called it \"This year's kinder, gentler Animal House.\"[11]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $17,453,216 in 2,689 theaters in its opening weekend at the U.S. box office, opening at #2 behind Daredevil which was on its second week at the top spot. Old School grossed receipts of $75,585,093 in the U.S. and Canada and $11,550,427 in international markets for a total of $87,135,520 worldwide.[1]\n\n### Awards\n\n- Artios Awards (2003) - nominated for Best Casting for Feature Film[12]\n- MTV Movie Awards (2003) - nominated for Best Comedic Performance (for Will Ferrell, losing to Mike Myers for Austin Powers in Goldmember) and for Best On-Screen Team (Ferrell, Vaughn, Wilson)[13]\n- Taurus Awards (2003) - nominated for Best Fire Stunt[14]\n- Spike Guys' Choice Awards (2012) - won for Guy Movie Hall of Fame[15]\n\n## Home media\n\nOld School was released on VHS and DVD in both rated and unrated versions on June 10, 2003 by DreamWorks Home Entertainment.[16] The unrated Blu-ray was released on December 16, 2008.[17]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nAt the Mitch-a-palooza party, Snoop Dogg and Kokane perform \"Paper'd Up\", sampling Eric B &amp; Rakim's track \"Paid in Full\". The soundtrack also includes \"Fun Night\" by Andrew W.K., \"Dust in the Wind\" by Kansas, \"Hungry Like the Wolf\", \"The Farmer in the Dell\", \"Gonna Make You Sweat\", \"Louie Louie\" by Black Flag, \"Chariots of Fire\", \"Good Lovin' Gone Bad\", \"Master of Puppets\" by Metallica, \"Playground in My Mind\" by Clint Holmes and \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. The main song in this movie is \"Here I Go Again\" by Whitesnake, which is played when Will Ferrell's character is fixing his car and in the closing credits. Also, The Dan Band sings one of the famous songs of Bonnie Tyler, \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" (with some interesting improvisational departures as to the cover's lyrics), and Styx's \"Lady\". During the introductory sequence Ryan Adams' \"To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)\", co-written with David Rawlings, can be heard most memorably during the metal detector scene.[18]\n\n## Canceled sequel\n\nIn 2006, a sequel, titled Old School Dos, was written by Scot Armstrong but was turned down by original stars, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn.[2] The story concerned the aging fraternity going to spring break. While promoting Semi-Pro in 2008, Ferrell had this to say about the defunct project: \"I read [the script]. Some super funny set pieces, but I don't know. I think Vince [Vaughn] had the same reaction. We’re just kind of doing the same thing again. It was like us going to Spring Break, but we’ve got to find this guy who's the head of a fraternity. Once again, funny things but it's just us once again back in a fraternity setting. It just felt like it was repeating. But watch, I'm over-thinking it.\"[19]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Old School (2003)\". Box Office Mojo.

The success of <strong>Road Trip</strong> prompted Armstrong and Phillips to pitch Reitman on a fraternity-themed film centered around adult men instead of the usual college-aged kids. Said Armstrong, \"There's a weird brotherhood that happens when you're in college where you're kind of finding yourself, and it was funny to think of old people doing it.\"</p>\n        <p><strong>Old School</strong> was filmed in and around <strong>La Crescenta, California</strong> from January 7, 2002 until March 18, 2002. Filming locations included <strong>Palisades High School</strong>, <strong>UCLA</strong>, <strong>USC</strong> and <strong>Harvard University</strong>. The film is considered a forerunner to the <strong>Frat Pack</strong> since three of its stars—Ferrell, Vaughn, and Wilson—are core members of that group.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>Reception</h2>\n        <h3>Critical response</h3>\n        <p><strong>Old School</strong> received mixed to positive reviews.

Some super funny set pieces, but I don't know. I think Vince [Vaughn] had the same reaction. We’re just kind of doing the same thing again. It was like us going to Spring Break, but we’ve got to find this guy who's the head of a fraternity. Once again, funny things but it's just us once again back in a fraternity setting. It just felt like it was repeating.

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmerican Pie is a film series consisting of four sex comedy films. American Pie, the first film in the series, was released by Universal Pictures in 1999. The film became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon and gained a cult following among young people. Following American Pie, the second and third films in the series American Pie 2 (2001) and American Wedding (2003) were released; the fourth, American Reunion, was released in 2012. A spin-off film series entitled American Pie Presents\n\n# Themes of American Pie Original Trilogy + Reunion\n\nSo I know I can’t be the only person analyzing films in such a way that could throw serious themes over a trilogy like American Pie. Now, for this post, I’ll be excluding the spin-off American Pie movies. While I love them dearly, the original trilogy plus the reunion are the ultimate movies within the saga.\n\nSo, my point in this post is to open a conversation with, hopefully, a lot of people who felt the same way about these movies as I did.\n\nI felt like each movie had a specific theme to cover about relationships in general and they’re pretty important to me now as an adult who has grown from the time I first saw these to now, the millionth time watching them.\n\nHere are those themes I’d like to discuss:\n\nAmerican Pie 1 - Sex - The overall theme is growing from teen years to sexually active, young adult years. This movie covers the frustration of keeping up with your peers as they become sexually active and enter adult hood with partying and freedom. Your classic teenage coming of age movie, I believe. Although it’s relying HEAVILY on just the comedic aspects of these years, it still holds heavy meaning to heart with Jim meeting Michelle, Oz falling in love with Heather, and Vicky letting Kevin down easily with the realization that they’re both going to want to explore in college and not be tied down.\n\nAmerican Pie 2 - Love - This movie is more about friendship changes after high school, relationship changes between college couples, and simply true love, as Jim tries desperately to get with Nadia again, but eventually realizing he’d already met the perfect woman for coitus and true love as well……I realize I’m setting the best comedic story plots aside, but I really want to point out the deeper meanings here to see if my overall themes fit these movies, plus I’d like to know if anyone has seen special features or documentaries and knows if this was intentional.\n\nAmerican Wedding - Marriage and Commitment to Relationships - In this movie, my absolute favorite movie in the entire franchise, we see Jim and Michelle plan a beautiful wedding and get married. During this movie, we see the real life struggles of dealing with a marriage leading up to the moment, dealing with not-so-polite-but-still-true-friends (Steven), and the meaning of support from a friend-system. The way Jim’s friends go out of their way to help his wedding go well is beyond me. I had ZERO friends help with my wedding. They all showed up for free booze though -\\_-\n\nAmerican Reunion - Conserving Relationships - This movie is the final movie for the original cast members and I think it’s simply made to bring their story to somewhat of an end. Showing that no matter what happens, everyone lives on and finds their niche in life.

This movie covers the frustration of keeping up with your peers as they become sexually active and enter adulthood with partying and freedom. Your classic teenage coming of age movie, I believe. Although it’s relying HEAVILY on just the comedic aspects of these years, it still holds heavy meaning to heart with Jim meeting Michelle, Oz falling in love with Heather, and Vicky letting Kevin down easily with the realization that they’re both going to want to explore in college and not be tied down.</Description>\n        </Theme>\n        <Theme>\n            <Title>American Pie 2</Title>\n            <Description>This movie is more about friendship changes after high school, relationship changes between college couples, and simply true love, as Jim tries desperately to get with Nadia again, but eventually realizing he’d already met the perfect woman for coitus and true love as well.</Description>\n        </Theme>\n        <Theme>\n            <Title>American Wedding</Title>\n            <Description>In this movie, my absolute favorite movie in the entire franchise, we see Jim and Michelle plan a beautiful wedding and get married.

He is neither here.\n\nI don’t think it’s a case of everyone simply going for the big bucks either. It’s actually hard to figure out who “The Sitter” would appeal to, though I’m sure director David Gordon Green (“Pineapple Express”) and writers Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, in their first produced screenplay, are betting that Hill’s hard-core fans will line up for anything that has his name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story itself is a very hard-R variation on “Uncle Buck,” if… if the uncle was no relation, if he was a sex-obsessed, frequently stoned college dropout, if the kids were irritating, insane, occasionally violent and spouting most of the profanity.\n\nThe film opens on a low. A shot of a writhing young blond in the midst of an exhaustive moaning orgasm and then the camera pulls back to reveal Noah (Hill) lifting his head to switch from an oral to a verbal tease. No innuendo, no humor, no satisfaction.\n\nAfter his recent string of classy turns, “Moneyball” opposite Brad Pitt in particular, it’s sad to see Hill back to being the head of the crass, but that is exactly where “The Sitter” lands him. Noah is yet another man-child role, in this case he’s got daddy issues, money woes and his sweet single mom will miss a rare date if he doesn’t fill in for her friend’s baby-sitter. If the rent weren’t free, he would just say no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo set the ground rules for his charges, Noah starts with death threats, though from the looks of it, this is a household that doesn’t know the meaning of ground rules. Nine-year-old Blithe (Landry Bender) is perfecting a hooker style, complete with heavy makeup and a potty mouth. Slater (Max Records) is a 13-year-old with high anxiety and pills to help him cope. Ten-year-old Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez), recently adopted from Mexico, has serious rage and runaway issues.\n\nMore conflict is needed and it comes from the blond (Ari Graynor), who is finally promising full-on sex if he’ll only pick up a little cocaine from her crazy drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell). Right now. Of course Noah immediately packs up the kids and heads out into this very long, dark, about-to-turn disastrous night. There will be blood — and drugs and drinking and sex and violence and, you know it’s coming, enlightenment for all.\n\nThe filmmakers try desperately to skate that thin line between socially redeeming and wanton excess by having Noah dish out some bits of wisdom and occasionally indicate he might care about the kids. But it is very thin ice and Hill never finds his balance, to say nothing of his comic timing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough table-turning “The Ransom of Red Chief” themes abound, somehow the exploding toilet and all the other “funny” mayhem, on which much of the film’s humor rides, seem sad instead.\n\nbetsy.sharkey@latimes.com\n\n### More to Read\n\n- Review \n COVID-19 gets the horror treatment in “Sick”; “Kids vs. Aliens” is sweetly scruffy    Jan. 20, 2023\n- Review \n Willie Mays swings away on HBO Max, and Cartoon Saloon’s fifth feature lands on Netflix    Nov. 11, 2022\n- Review \n Run, don’t walk, away from quirky social satire ‘Stanleyville’    April 21, 2022\n\nThe biggest entertainment stories\n\nGet our big stories about Hollywood, film, television, music, arts, culture and more right in your inbox as soon as they publish.\n\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFormer Los Angeles Times film critic Betsy Sharkey is an award-winning entertainment journalist and bestselling author.

I’m going with the filmmakers as the folks most responsible for perpetrating this terribly unfunny and overwhelmingly raunchy film that stars the normally likable, or at least comically forgivable, <Actor>Jonah Hill</Actor>. He is neither here.\n\n            I don’t think it’s a case of everyone simply going for the big bucks either. It’s actually hard to figure out who <Name>The Sitter</Name> would appeal to, though I’m sure director <Director>David Gordon Green</Director> and writers <Writers>Brian Gatewood</Writers> and <Writers>Alessandro Tanaka</Writers>, in their first produced screenplay, are betting that Hill’s hard-core fans will line up for anything that has his name on it.\n\n            The story itself is a very hard-R variation on “Uncle Buck,” if… if the uncle was no relation, if he was a sex-obsessed, frequently stoned college dropout, if the kids were irritating, insane, occasionally violent and spouting most of the profanity.\n\n            The film opens on a low. A shot of a writhing young blond in the midst of an exhaustive moaning orgasm and then the camera pulls back to reveal <Character>Noah</Character> (<Actor>Hill</Actor>) lifting his head to switch from an oral to a verbal tease. No innuendo, no humor, no satisfaction.\n\n            After his recent string of classy turns, <Movie>Moneyball</Movie> opposite <Actor>Brad Pitt</Actor> in particular, it’s sad to see <Actor>Hill</Actor> back to being the head of the crass, but that is exactly where <Name>The Sitter</Name> lands him. <Character>Noah</Character> is yet another man-child role, in this case he’s got daddy issues, money woes and his sweet single mom will miss a rare date if he doesn’t fill in for her friend’s baby-sitter. If the rent weren’t free, he would just say no.\n\n            To set the ground rules for his charges, <Character>Noah</Character> starts with death threats, though from the looks of it, this is a household that doesn’t know the meaning of ground rules. Nine-year-old <Character>Blithe</Character> (<Actor>Landry Bender</Actor>) is perfecting a hooker style, complete with heavy makeup and a potty mouth. <Character>Slater</Character> (<Actor>Max Records</Actor>) is a 13-year-old with high anxiety and pills to help him cope. Ten-year-old <Character>Rodrigo</Character> (<Actor>Kevin Hernandez</Actor>), recently adopted from Mexico, has serious rage and runaway issues.\n\n            More conflict is needed and it comes from the blond (<Actor>Ari Graynor</Actor>), who is finally promising full-on sex if he’ll only pick up a little cocaine from her crazy drug dealer <Character>Karl</Character> (<Actor>Sam Rockwell</Actor>). Right now. Of course <Character>Noah</Character> immediately packs up the kids and heads out into this very long, dark, about-to-turn disastrous night. There will be blood — and drugs and drinking and sex and violence and, you know it’s coming, enlightenment for all.\n\n            The filmmakers try desperately to skate that thin line between socially redeeming and wanton excess by having <Character>Noah</Character> dish out some bits of wisdom and occasionally indicate he might care about the kids. But it is very thin ice and <Actor>Hill</Actor> never finds his balance, to say nothing of his comic timing.\n\n            Though table-turning “The Ransom of Red Chief” themes abound, somehow the exploding toilet and all the other “funny” mayhem, on which much of the film’s humor rides, seem sad instead.\n        </Content>\n    </Review>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the movie's attributes while maintaining the original review's essence.

Over the past 10 years, there are only a handful of TV series that hold a candle to Apatow's Freaks &amp; Greeks and Undeclared, and his directorial debut The 40-Year-Old Virgin is pretty much the current dirty/sweet-comedy standard-bearer; Knocked Up suggests that beyond being a sensational entertainer, Apatow may be that rare comic pioneer who is also (gasp!) a comedic artist.\n\nApatow's series and films have focused on the mystery - and the eventual, mutual acceptance - of the \"us\" and the \"them\": the freaks and the geeks (both high-school and college variety) in Freaks &amp; Geeks and Undeclared, the worldly and the inexperienced in Virgin. Yet Knocked Up marks the first time the writer/director has focused his attention specifically on the \"us\" and \"them\" of men and women, and in doing so, has created something of a cultural milestone. As entertaining as many of today's movie comedies are - Blades of Glory, I'm convinced, is a slob classic in the making - none of them demonstrates the generosity of spirit, and the inspiring fascination, of Apatow's; he's an \"us\" who wants to deeply understand being a \"them.\" And in Knocked Up, he's forged the absolute rarest kind of popular comedy: a completely nonjudgmental one.\n\nSee the trailer and you'll know the hook: Shlubby slacker Ben (Seth Rogen) sleeps with stunning Alison (Katherine Heigl), the one-night stand leads to pregnancy, and the aforementioned slacker subsequently tries to be a responsible daddy-to-be. Yet what the trailers can't impart in three minutes (or, on TV, in 30 seconds) is how much Ben wants to be a responsible daddy-to-be. Though overwhelmed by the news of Alison's expectancy, he's not altogether unhappy about it - he genuinely wants to give this dad thing a try. (In one of the movie's sweetest touches, Ben, right from the beginning, seeks parental advice from his perfectly unhelpful father, played by Harold Ramis.) Ben legitimately wants to understand fatherhood, and understand Alison, and the film's comedy - and its heartbreak - comes from his completely well-meaning, fundamentally inept attempts to do so.\n\nThe movie is obsessively, and hysterically, male-centric, and numerous scenes are devoted to the hijinks of Ben's sense-and-hygiene-deprived roommates, an achingly funny, motley crew composed of Apatow stock players Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr. But Apatow, fascinated as he appears to be by the opposite sex, is careful to give equal weight to Alison's travails as well; he's one of the few directors of American comedies not interested in using women solely as props. (Lurking behind the plot-goosing theme of \"Will Ben learn to grow up?\" is \"Will Alison wait around long enough to find out?\") Apatow never suggests that Ben's crisis of the spirit is more meaningful than hers, and Alison's frequent (yet not mean-spirited) humiliation as a result of her pregnancy leads to some devastatingly true (yet still funny) moments.\n\nAnd complementing the Ben-and-Alison storyline are the characters of Alison's sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann), and her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), figures of matrimonial \"perfection\" - gorgeous house, beautiful kids - whose relationship is rife with insecurity and disappointment ... but only as much as anyone's is. Debbie and Pete know they love each other, and they adore their kids, but they remain ever-vigilant for something coming along to ruin everything, and are well aware that, in their paranoia, they might be ruining things themselves. Knocked Up shows astonishingly keen insight into the dynamics of male-female relationships; it's the rare movie that could conceivably end with both men and women leaving the auditorium whispering to themselves, \"This movie is about me.\"\n\nNone of the film's dare-I-say-it-again artistic success would be possible without supremely empathetic performances across the board, and the offhandedly charismatic, marvelously funny Rogen and the fantastically spirited, unexpectedly moving Heigl are a comic dream pairing. Yet Apatow has also, consistently and generously, elicited detailed work by his works' less-central characters, and in addition to the Knocked Up cameos that feel as brilliantly fleshed-out as the film's leads - The Office's Craig Robinson has an unforgettable bit as an intimidatingly honest bouncer, and Alan Tudyk and Kristen Wiig are sleazy perfection as Alsion's employers - the film's supporting characters all feel real, and are unfailingly funny, to boot; Leslie Mann (who is Apatow's wife) gives a portrayal of such richly imagined variety that she nearly emerges as the film's star.\n\nWith all of the attention paid to such seemingly passé elements as \"character detail\" and \"honesty,\" it's almost ridiculous that Knocked Up should also be as hilarious as it is, but I can't imagine that more than two minutes pass without a hearty belly laugh. There are more than enough supremely clever lines here to satisfy anyone with even a rudimentary pop-culture awareness (Matthew Fox, James Gandolfini, and Steely Dan might not be so amused), and there's practically no end to the scenes that make you wince while you're roaring; the comedically cringe-inducing scene of Ben and Alison trying, in vain, to resume their sex life many months into the pregnancy yields nearly cleansing audience response.\n\nYet even the movie's most sincere scenes come planted with throwaway jokes that make you laugh out loud ... and get misty-eyed directly thereafter. Wanting him to admit the affair she's sure he's having, Debbie angrily confronts her husband, asking where he was the other night. Sheepishly, Pete admits to his wife that he snuck off to see Spider-Man 3, and he didn't tell her because he just needed some time alone, and didn't want to hurt her feelings. Momentarily thrown by this confession, Debbie takes a moment to take in the information, and - simultaneously understanding and envious of Pete's need for experiences removed from the family - responds with a teary-eyed, \"I like Spider-Man... !\"\n\nIt's nearly impossible to describe what makes that line, in context, so beautiful. But it's tied in to Judd Apatow's remarkable grasp on human idiosyncrasy, and our habit for doing the wrong thing while trying desperately to do the right thing, and it underlines why Knocked Up - for all of its Summer Blockbuster appeal - is likely to endure as a comedy classic, as much a comment on our times and mores as Tootsie or Some Like It Hot ... or The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\n\nAlthough I probably should admit this: I may have that Leslie Mann quote wrong. She might actually say \"love\" instead of \"like.\" I'll see the movie again just to be sure, but here's something I don't have wrong: I love Knocked Up. For all of its presumed inconsequence, it is - thus far - the movie of the year.\n\n### Author\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMike Schulz\n\n## Support the River Cities' Reader\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Old School Subscription for Your Support\n\nGet the printed Reader edition mailed to you (or anyone you want) first-class for 12 months for $48.\n\n$24 goes to postage and handling, $24 goes to keeping the doors open!\n\n### Click this link to Old School Subscribe now.\n\n## Help Keep the Reader Alive and Free Since '93!\n\n\"We're the River Cities' Reader, and we've kept the Quad Cities' only independently owned newspaper alive and free since 1993.\nSo please help the Reader keep going with your one-time, monthly, or annual support.\nWith your financial support the Reader can continue providing uncensored, non-scripted, and independent journalism alongside the Quad Cities' area's most comprehensive cultural coverage.\" - Todd McGreevy, Publisher\n\n## Subscribe &amp; Listen to Reader Podcasts\n\n## On Stands Now\n\nRiver Cities Reader #1015 -... by River Cities Reader\n\n## Tagged Content\n\n## Two Ways to Subscribe\n\n#### 1.

Over the past 10 years, there are only a handful of TV series that hold a candle to <directorName>Apatow's</directorName> <seriesName>Freaks & Geeks</seriesName> and <seriesName>Undeclared</seriesName>, and his directorial debut <movieTitle>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</movieTitle> is pretty much the current dirty/sweet-comedy standard-bearer; <movieTitle>Knocked Up</movieTitle> suggests that beyond being a sensational entertainer, <directorName>Apatow</directorName> may be that rare comic pioneer who is also (gasp!) a comedic artist.\n\n        <movieTitle>Knocked Up</movieTitle> marks the first time the writer/director has focused his attention specifically on the \"us\" and \"them\" of men and women, and in doing so, has created something of a cultural milestone. As entertaining as many of today's movie comedies are - <movieTitle>Blades of Glory</movieTitle>, I'm convinced, is a slob classic in the making - none of them demonstrates the generosity of spirit, and the inspiring fascination, of <directorName>Apatow</directorName>; he's an \"us\" who wants to deeply understand being a \"them.\" And in <movieTitle>Knocked Up</movieTitle>, he's forged the absolute rarest kind of popular comedy: a completely nonjudgmental one.\n\n        See the trailer and you'll know the hook: Shlubby slacker <characterName>Ben</characterName> (<actorName>Seth Rogen</actorName>) sleeps with stunning <characterName>Alison</characterName> (<actorName>Katherine Heigl</actorName>), the one-night stand leads to pregnancy, and the aforementioned slacker subsequently tries to be a responsible daddy-to-be. Yet what the trailers can't impart in three minutes (or, on TV, in 30 seconds) is how much <characterName>Ben</characterName> wants to be a responsible daddy-to-be. Though overwhelmed by the news of <characterName>Alison's</characterName> expectancy, he's not altogether unhappy about it - he genuinely wants to give this dad thing a try. \n\n        The movie is obsessively, and hysterically, male-centric, and numerous scenes are devoted to the hijinks of <characterName>Ben's</characterName> sense-and-hygiene-deprived roommates, an achingly funny, motley crew composed of <actorName>Jay Baruchel</actorName>, <actorName>Jonah Hill</actorName>, <actorName>Jason Segel</actorName>, and <actorName>Martin Starr</actorName>.

Premiering during the summer blockbuster release slot, Pineapple Express is a film that fuses the action comedy with a storyline revolving around marijuana with the absurdist comedic stylings of writing partners Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Produced by coveted comedy producer Judd Aptow and directed by David Gordon Green who is known for his drama works, the rated R motion picture pushed the barriers of cinematic production code to demystify the use of marijuana on screen. The satirical buddy comedy starring Seth Rogen as the protagonist “Dale Denton”, and James Franco as marijuana dealer “Saul Silver” ignores all social boundaries of humor and political correctness in a manner that reflects the developing federal laws and socio-political beliefs in the U.S. The film “Reefer Madness” (1936), directed by Louis J. Gasnier, was released in 1936 and the political tone reflects the North American stigma surrounding marijuana as a text of cultural analysis. Comparing The Hangover franchise that’s narratives center around the abuse of alcohol, The Motion Picture Production Code further contextualizes the industries developing sentiments regarding the filming of substance use for cinematic entertainment.\n\nJames Franco and Seth Rogen in Pineapple Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere is not substantial critical research on this film or film genre because of how stigmatized marijuana use has been in society until recent political victories towards legalization. Due to this lack of a discussion in the cinematic field, most research obtained in this article has been collected based on Seth Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg’s experience producing this politically taboo plot film. The specific creative, comedic, and marketing stylings the pair employed in the production process of Pineapple Express were simultaneously pushing the boundaries of the industry and the state of federal law and reflect the evolution of ideology surrounding marijuana in society. In 1936, George A. Hirliman Productions released Reefer Madness, a film dedicated to spreading the idea that teens smoking marijuana would lead to insanity (1).\n\nPromotional Poster for ‘Reefer Madness’ 1936.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis anti-marijuana sentiment has been hard to tear out of the framework of suitable media for public viewership as on screen drug use is feared as glamorizing an unhealthy lifestyle. It is now an infamous representation of the common 20th century fear of ‘Marihuana’ as it was labeled a hard drug, and it’s users labeled as victims.\n\nBill Hader in opening short of ‘Pineapple Express’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the opening sequence of Pineapple Express, Bill Hader plays a military test subject, depicted smoking a joint and being analyzed by government scientists (2). The sequence is shot in black and white to imply that this scene takes place in past decades, and the reaction of the scientists to the use of marijuana is cautious and satirical, as a man wears a scuba diver tank suit to light Hader’s joint. The blocking and staging of this short scene come together to play off the hysteria surrounding marijuana that was the sentiment of the Reefer Madness era.\n\nSecond Scene of ‘Pineapple Express’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis sequence match cuts directly to the film’s protagonist, Rogen as “Dale” in color, smoking a joint in his car stating “if marijuana is legal within the next five years, I have no faith left in humanity. Period.”\n\nCheech and Chong in ‘Up in Smoke’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterestingly, as Pineapple Express was in production in the year of 2007, and in 2012, Colorado was the first state in the US to legalize recreational use, Dale’s opinion written by Rogen and Goldberg was an accurate prediction of the course of US American politics. Standing on the backbones of historical stoner filmmakers like Cheech &amp; Chong, Rogen and Goldberg have modernized the stoner comedy to voice their opinion on this substance’s use and to connect to a niche audience to build a cult following. Even the two films mise-en-scéne, often including personality cars, messy bedrooms and dirty outdoors, Rogen and Goldberg plays into a realistic ‘stoner style’ psychology.\n\nEvan Goldberg and Seth Rogen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n‘House Plant’ Product by Rogen and Goldberg\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe pair have been successful in creating some of this generation’s most successful summer comedies and have done so with many of the same revolving cast members. Recently, Rogen and Goldberg have ventured into television, and in 2019, the two premiered their show that is loved and acclaimed ‘The Boys’ on Amazon Prime. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg perfect the buddy comedy formula to go on to produce this generation’s most coveted buddy comedies. Establishing a marijuana service company called “Houseplant” in their home country of Canada in 2019, Rogen and Goldberg seemingly endorse the benefits of marijuana while questioning the federal criminalization of the plant in their work and political views that shine through (3). The changing portrayal of marijuana in the film industry reflects the developing federal socio-political beliefs surrounding recreational use of the substance.\n\nPineapple Express vs. The Hangover\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Hangover Part 1 (2009) and Pineapple Express (2008) are two films that narratives are rooted in the use of alcohol and marijuana, however there is a significant difference in the social reception of the two substances. While there was the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s and into the 1930s, once legalized again, alcohol quickly became socially acceptable again. Marijuana on the other hand, has had a slower socio-political journey, and while recently recreational use has been supported in legislature, at the time of Pineapple Express’ release, marijuana was still illegal to use in any form in the US. Published in 1947, The Motion Picture Production Code states that “No picture shall be produced which will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience shall never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin” (4).\n\nJames Franco\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPineapple Express and buddy comedies like it that’s storylines revolve around substance use and illegal activities inherently go against the film industry’s code. However, In an interview with the British magazine “Smoking Aces” James Franco addresses the socio-political discrepancies in the film industry stating that “There’s a long tradition of party movies like Animal House or whatever, where they’re drinking a lot of alcohol. I don’t really see any difference between drinking beer or smoking a joint. Hollywood tends to sweep that under the carpet” (5). Compared to The Hangover franchise that’s narrative surrounds alcohol use, a legal abuse of a drug, Pineapple Express surrounds marijuana and characters attempt to obtain, at the characters attempt to obtain the drug, at the time, an illegal substance for harmless recreational use. Pineapple Express is not able to get the same kind of budget as The Hangover series got because their narrative catalyst substance was unrightfully criminalized.\n\nPromotional poster for ‘The Hangover Part 1’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile these production codes are dated and, given the modern day rating system, rather irrelevant in audience reception. In an interview with EW magazine, Rogen revealed that their team asked for a $40 million budget, “But because it’s a weed movie, you get $25 million”(6). Pineapple Express quadrupled its budget, grossing $102 million worldwide. Comparatively, The Hangover Part 1 was granted a $36 million dollar budget and grossed $467 million worldwide (7). There are many factors that could be responsible for the difference in support and reception of these two similar films, but it’s safe to say that the depiction of alcohol substance abuse on screen is still socially more acceptable worldwide. The Hangover franchise features the use of many illegal substances and activities and fails to punish its characters for their breaking or moral and production standards in the same manner Pineapple Express’ narrative structure treated the consequences for their protagonists conducting defensive harm to others. Nevertheless, Pineapple Express includes no use of any substance besides marijuana in safe settings, and all additional life-or-death violence featured in the narrative are the results of freak incidents that have little connection to the use of the substance. Marijuana has made large strides in becoming accepted by society, and compared to the iconic stoner classic by Cheech and Chong, “Up in Smoke” (1978), with a $2 million budget and grossing $44 million worldwide (8), the stoner comedy genre is a prosperous and evolving market with time for socio-political growth.\n\nPromotional Poster for ‘Pineapple Express’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe high stakes of the life or death fights and chases written in Pineapple Express are a form of comedic absurdist humor that’s jokes are satirical in nature, utilizing the lighthearted conventions of the buddy comedy genre to destigmatize the myths of marijuana use. It is notably ironic that even though he plays the airhead marijuana dealer Saul, Rogen noted in an interview with MTV that his co-star James Franco doesn’t smoke marijuana in real life but that Franco still asked Rogen and Goldberg to play the dealer for a challenge (9). Franco, without experience with the substance in reality, plays the archetype of the modern day dealer so that Rogen’s type casted performance as the film’s resident stoner encompasses the representational archetype of the modern day stoner. He turns the performance of a taboo character archetype into art and Franco ends up scoring a nomination in the 2009 Golden Globe Awards for “Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy” for his role in the film, further demystifying the world of marijuana use.\n\nTweet by Seth Rogen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a tweet from August 6th, 2018, Seth Rogen admitted that although “Red,” played by Danny McBride, was supposed to be killed off in the middle of the film, Seth and Evan found the actor so funny they wrote him in to keep being violently injured to be obscenely dragged through the rest of the story (10). Rogen and Goldberg recognized something special in McBride’s performance and made the executive decision to put the genuine and the quality of comedy before their narrative. Looking at the film at its surface level, the narrative is not complex or moving, it is the uniqueness of the characters and their relationships that make the film stand out.\n\nDanny McBride as ‘Red’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHowever, if Red were killed off in the middle of the narrative and was never given the opportunity to redeem himself as a friend for ratting out Saul, the reception of the value of relationships in this narrative may have been lost completely. In the end, Red saves Saul and Dale from their execution by the enemy drug lords, a convention of the buddy comedy genre in the works. Running Craig Robinson’s character over with his car and saving the day, Dale, Saul and Red win the chase and as they rejoice in a meal at a diner in the films final scene, Red begins to bleed out. Dale and Saul dryly acknowledge that Red who has sustained multiple gunshot wounds and other injuries is remarkably still alive. The lighthearted tone of this scene is fueled by the juxtaposition of the violent absurdity of this films narrative. The fact that the center of all this violence is rooted in the world of marijuana substance use and selling plays off of the cultural fears and myths of the plant.\n\nPineapple Express is a significant film to the modern contemporary generations influence of the evolution of the industry and political social sphere. The film’s satirical and opinionated implications push the boundaries of what is socially acceptable because there is a market for film that exposes the unknown. Films centered around substance use and taboo topics only further deepen social dialogues and evolve the comedic genre to be more accepting of all walks of life.\n\nPromotional Poster for Pineapple Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSources:\n\n- Meade, Lawrence., Hoerl, Arthur, Gasnier, Louis J., and Hirliman, George A.

Premiering during the summer blockbuster release slot, Pineapple Express is a film that fuses the <Genre>action comedy</Genre> with a storyline revolving around <keyword>marijuana</keyword> with the absurdist comedic stylings of writing partners <keyword>Seth Rogen</keyword> and <keyword>Evan Goldberg</keyword>. Produced by coveted comedy producer <keyword>Judd Apatow</keyword> and directed by <keyword>David Gordon Green</keyword> who is known for his drama works, the rated R motion picture pushed the barriers of cinematic production code to demystify the use of marijuana on screen.</p>\n        \n        <p>The satirical buddy comedy starring <keyword>Seth Rogen</keyword> as the protagonist “<character>Dale Denton</character>”, and <keyword>James Franco</keyword> as marijuana dealer “<character>Saul Silver</character>” ignores all social boundaries of humor and political correctness in a manner that reflects the developing federal laws and socio-political beliefs in the U.S. The film “<keyword>Reefer Madness</keyword>” (1936), directed by <keyword>Louis J. Gasnier</keyword>, was released in 1936 and the political tone reflects the North American stigma surrounding marijuana as a text of cultural analysis.</p>\n        \n        <p>There is not substantial critical research on this film or film genre because of how stigmatized marijuana use has been in society until recent political victories towards legalization. Due to this lack of a discussion in the cinematic field, most research obtained in this article has been collected based on <keyword>Seth Rogen</keyword> and his writing partner <keyword>Evan Goldberg</keyword>’s experience producing this politically taboo plot film. The specific creative, comedic, and marketing stylings the pair employed in the production process of Pineapple Express were simultaneously pushing the boundaries of the industry and the state of federal law and reflect the evolution of ideology surrounding marijuana in society.</p>\n        \n        <p>Interestingly, as Pineapple Express was in production in the year of 2007, and in 2012, Colorado was the first state in the US to legalize recreational use, <character>Dale</character>’s opinion written by <keyword>Rogen</keyword> and <keyword>Goldberg</keyword> was an accurate prediction of the course of US American politics. Standing on the backbones of historical stoner filmmakers like <keyword>Cheech & Chong</keyword>, <keyword>Rogen</keyword> and <keyword>Goldberg</keyword> have modernized the stoner comedy to voice their opinion on this substance’s use and to connect to a niche audience to build a cult following.</p>\n        \n        <p>The high stakes of the life or death fights and chases written in Pineapple Express are a form of comedic absurdist humor that’s jokes are satirical in nature, utilizing the lighthearted conventions of the buddy comedy genre to destigmatize the myths of marijuana use. It is notably ironic that even though he plays the airhead marijuana dealer <character>Saul</character>, <keyword>Rogen</keyword> noted in an interview with MTV that his co-star <keyword>James Franco</keyword> doesn’t smoke marijuana in real life but that <keyword>Franco</keyword> still asked <keyword>Rogen</keyword> and <keyword>Goldberg</keyword> to play the dealer for a challenge.</p>\n        \n        <p>Pineapple Express is a significant film to the modern contemporary generations influence of the evolution of the industry and political social sphere. The film’s satirical and opinionated implications push the boundaries of what is socially acceptable because there is a market for film that exposes the unknown. Films centered around substance use and taboo topics only further deepen social dialogues and evolve the comedic genre to be more accepting of all walks of life.</p>\n    </articleContent>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key terms and segments are wrapped in appropriate XML tags.
