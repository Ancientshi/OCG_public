The film is an Italian–American[4] venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, and broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society.\n\nIt was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third installment of Leone's Once Upon a Time Trilogy, which includes Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Duck, You Sucker! (1971).[7] The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes (2 hours and 19 minutes), and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement.\n\nThe US edit was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favourite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest films of all time, especially in the gangster genre.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the 1930s, three thugs search for a man named \"Noodles\". Noodles is drugging himself in an opium den with a newspaper next to him featuring the death of bootleggers Patrick Goldberg, Philip Stein, and Maximilian Bercovicz. He recalls the police removing their corpses, one burnt beyond recognition. Noodles evades capture and leaves the city.\n\nIn 1918, David \"Noodles\" Aaronson leads a gang of him and his three friends \"Patsy\" Goldberg, \"Cockeye\" Stein and Dominic, performing jobs for local gangster Bugsy. They meet Max as he foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by corrupt police officer Whitey. Max joins their gang and they later blackmail Whitey and get the same police protection as Bugsy.\n\nThe gang becomes successful liquor smugglers. They deposit their earnings in a locker, giving the key to a friend of theirs, Moe. Noodles is in love with Moe's sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer. Due to his socialization as a gangster, Deborah sees no future for their love. Bugsy, now a rival, ambushes the gang and fatally shoots Dominic. Noodles kills Bugsy and is sentenced to prison.\n\nUpon his release a decade later, Noodles rejoins his gang. During a diamond heist they use jewellery employee Carol as their informant. She goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later becomes Max's girlfriend. Noodles realizes that the heist was commissioned by a syndicate figure to eliminate competition. This leads to tensions between Max and Noodles, who seeks independence. The gang provides protection for Teamsters' union boss O'Donnell, during the course of which they exchange newborns at a clinic, punishing the head of the police whose wife has just given birth to a boy at that clinic. This results in the police withdrawing their actions against striking workers.\n\nNoodles takes Deborah on a lavish date. When she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood, he snaps and rapes her. As she departs the next day, he attempts to catch a glance of her sitting on the train, but she avoids eye contact.\n\nThe repeal of Prohibition forces the gang to look for alternative activities. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem too risky. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out. Upon regaining consciousness, Noodles learns that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police during the heist, as established at the beginning of the film. A guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. During his subsequent escape, he realizes the locker money has disappeared.\n\nIn the 1960s, Noodles returns to Manhattan for the first time since the 1930s after receiving a letter indicating that his identity has been uncovered, seeking to find out who is responsible. He learns that the bodies of his three friends have been relocated to Riverdale. He visits their mausoleum in Riverdale and finds a key to a railway locker.\n\nThe locker reveals a suitcase full of money, stated to be the advance on his next job. Noodles learns of the corruption scandals around Senator Christopher Bailey and visits Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and that Max opened fire first, wishing to die young. Noodles spots Deborah in a memorial photograph, who has become a major actress, and starts to suspect a connection between Deborah and Bailey. He tracks down Deborah and visits her, telling her about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion and challenging her to tell him about the mysterious job as well as the identity of Bailey. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave the city before facing hurtful revelations. Ignoring her advice, Noodles leaves her after seeing Bailey's son, who looks like the young Max.\n\nNoodles meets Bailey, who turns out to be Max. Having faked his death, Max stole the gang's money and reinvented himself as a self-made business man. He also made Deborah his mistress, thus robbing Noodles of everything he had. Faced with ruin due to the corruption scandal, Max reveals that he is behind the mysterious job, which is for Noodles to kill him. Noodles refuses. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck passes and a man, presumably Max, walks toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck's auger conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.\n\n## Interpretations\n\nAs the film begins and ends in 1933, with Noodles hiding in an opium den from syndicate hitmen, and the last shot of the film is of Noodles in a smiling, opium-soaked high, the film can be interpreted as having been a drug-induced dream, with Noodles remembering his past and envisioning the future. In an interview by Noël Simsolo published in 1987, Leone lent support to this interpretation, saying that the scenes set in the 1960s could be seen as an opium dream of Noodles'.[8] In the DVD commentary for the film, film historian and critic Richard Schickel states that opium users often report vivid dreams, and that these visions have a tendency to explore the user's past and future.[9]\n\nThe ending, in which Max disappears behind a truck as Noodles is leaving Bailey's mansion, only for Noodles to see the blades of the truck spinning, was reportedly left ambiguous on purpose. James Woods, who played Max, stated that he does not know if Max jumped in the truck or just disappeared. Critic Carlo Affatigato described this twist as a \"paradox\", postulating that the whole film is about how Noodles spends the second half of his life seeking out the truth of what happened, only to discover it, not accept it, and not investigate what happens to Max in the end. Noodles only wants to believe the reality he has created for himself, not an objective one. Affatigato also believes this could point to it all being the imagination of Noodles.[10]\n\nMany people (including Schickel) assume that the 1968 Frisbee scene, which has an immediate cut and gives no further resolution, was part of a longer sequence.[11] Ebert stated that the purpose of the flying disc scene was to establish the 1960s time frame and nothing more.[12]\n\n## Cast\n\n- Robert De Niro as David \"Noodles\" Aaronson\n    - Scott Tiler as young Noodles\n- James Woods as Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz\n    - Rusty Jacobs as young Max and David Bailey\n- Elizabeth McGovern as Deborah Gelly\n    - Jennifer Connelly as young Deborah\n- Joe Pesci as Francis \"Frankie\" Monaldi\n- Burt Young as Joe Monaldi\n- Tuesday Weld as Carol\n- Treat Williams as Jimmy Conway O'Donnell\n- Danny Aiello as Police Chief Vincent Aiello\n- Richard Bright as \"Chicken\" Joe\n- James Hayden as Patrick \"Patsy\" Goldberg\n    - Brian Bloom as young Patsy\n- William Forsythe as Philip \"Cockeye\" Stein\n    - Adrian Curran as young Cockeye\n- Darlanne Fluegel as Eve\n- Larry Rapp as \"Fat\" Moe Gelly\n    - Mike Monetti as young Fat Moe\n- Richard Foronjy as officer \"Fartface\" Whitey\n- Robert Harper as Sharkey\n- Dutch Miller as Van Linden\n- Gerard Murphy as Crowning\n- Amy Ryder as Peggy\n    - Julie Cohen as young Peggy\n- Estelle Harris as Peggy's mother\n\nThe cast also includes Noah Moazezi as Dominic, James Russo as Bugsy, producer Arnon Milchan as Noodles' chauffeur, Marcia Jean Kurtz as Max's mother, Joey Faye as an \"adorable old man\", and Olga Karlatos as a wayang patron. Frank Gio, Ray Dittrich, and Mario Brega (a Leone regular who had appeared in Dollars Trilogy) respectively appear as Beefy, Trigger, and Mandy, a trio of gangsters who search for Noodles. Frequent De Niro collaborator Chuck Low and Leone's daughter Francesca respectively make uncredited appearances as Fat Moe (and Deborah's father), and as David Bailey's girlfriend.[3] In the 2012 restoration, Louise Fletcher appears as the cemetery director of Riverdale, where Noodles visits his friends' tomb in 1968.[13]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, Sergio Leone had read the novel The Hoods by Harry Grey, a pseudonym for the former gangster-turned-informant whose real name was Harry Goldberg. In 1968, after shooting Once Upon a Time in the West, Leone made many efforts to talk to Grey. Having enjoyed Leone's Dollars Trilogy, Grey finally responded and agreed to meet with Leone at a Manhattan bar.[14] Following that initial meeting, Leone met with Grey several times throughout the remainder of the 1960s and 1970s, having discussions with him to understand America through Grey's point of view.[15][16]\n\nIntent on making another trilogy about America consisting of Once Upon a Time in the West, Duck, You Sucker! and Once Upon a Time in America, Leone turned down an offer from Paramount Pictures to direct The Godfather in order to pursue his pet project.[15][16]\n\nAt some point Leone considered other colleagues including Miloš Forman and John Milius for the role of director, with him just serving as producer.[17] For some time the project was linked to French producters André Génovès and Gérard Lebovici and later to Gaumont, with Gérard Depardieu and Jean Gabin supposed to be main actors.[18]\n\nAcquiring the rights to the novel proved to be complicated, as they had been bought by Dan Curtis, who intended to shoot the film and refused various offers by Leone and by his backers to sell the rights.[19] Curtis eventually transferred the rights to Alberto Grimaldi, in exchange for Grimaldi's production of his $2 million film Burnt Offerings.[20]\n\nInitially, only a draft for the film's opening scene was made, penned by Ernesto Gastaldi and developed by Robert Dillon, which Dillon eventually used in John Frankenheimer's film 99 and 44/100% Dead, much to Leone's dismay.[21] \nAfter Grimaldi bought the rights, he felt that he needed an American scriptwriter to faithfully capture the spirit of the novel; he eventually made a deal with Norman Mailer, whose draft greatly disappointed both Grimaldi and Leone, who later described Mailer's draft as 'a Mickey Mouse version [of the novel]' that lacked in structure and 'made no sense at all'.[22]  A few elements of Norman Mailer's first two drafts would eventually appear in the film.[23]\n\nAfter Mailer's fiasco, Leone opted for an all-Italian team of scriptwriters: Leonardo Benvenuti and Piero De Bernardi would focus on the 1920s section, Enrico Medioli on the 1930s section, and Franco \"Kim\" Arcalli on the time shifts, with Leone supervising and Franco Ferrini polishing the script.[24] As of 1975-6 Leone's casting ideas still included Depardieu and Gabin, as well as Richard Dreyfuss as Max, James Cagney, Robert Charlebois, and appearances by Henry Fonda, James Stewart, George Raft and Glenn Ford.[25] In 1976, Ennio Morricone had already composed all the main themes for the film.[25] In the meanwhile relations between Grimaldi and Leone soured, with Grimaldi unconvinced of the film's commercial viability and eventually exiting the project, being replaced in 1980 by Arnon Milchan.[26] At this stage, Leone's casting ideas included Tom Berenger, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman and Liza Minnelli.[27] A 317 pages shooting script was completed in late 1981.[28]  The final script, translated in English by Stuart M. Kaminsky, was approved by Leone in May 1982.[29]\n\n### Casting\n\nIn 1981, at Milchan's suggestion, Leone met Robert De Niro  and eventually offered him a role of his choice between Noodles and Max.[30] De Niro's commitment turned out to be crucial for Milchan's securing the financial backing for the film.[31]\n\nFor the role of Max, eventually played by James Woods, about 200 actors were auditioned.[32] Elizabeth McGovern was chosen for the role of Deborah against De Niro's request for having a New York native with a Brooklyn accent, due to Leone's appreciation of her performance in Ragtime.[32] Joe Pesci was chosen by Arnon Milchan because of his role in Raging Bull, and was offered a supporting role of his choice.[32] Tuesday Weld was cast as Carol, a role that Leone had previously envisioned for Claudia Cardinale, at De Niro's recommendation.[33]\n\nFor the children's roles, Leone entrusted the task to Cis Corman and asked him not to have child stars and instead to have actors who had lived in New York's Jewish neighborhood and had no previous acting experience; in the end, Corman provided mostly actors without film credits but with experiences on stage and on television.[34]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe filming of Once Upon a Time in America started in June 1982 and eventually ended in April the next year. The locations where the shooting took place were in and around US, Canada, Italy, and France, with a focal point in New York City.[35] Interior scenes were mostly filmed at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome.[36]\n\nThe beach scene, where Max unveils his plan to rob the Federal Reserve, was shot at The Don CeSar in St. Pete Beach, Florida.[37] The New York's railway \"Grand Central Station\" scene in the thirties flashbacks was filmed in the Gare du Nord in Paris.[38] The interiors of the lavish restaurant where Noodles takes Deborah on their date were shot in the Hotel Excelsior [it] in Venice, Italy.[38] Shooting in New York proved to be difficult, as the IATSE labor union raised a strong controversy over Leone's use of a foreign crew, and launched such a massive public protest campaign that President Ronald Reagan called for a Department of Labor investigation into the matter.[39]\n\nDe Niro shot his scenes in chronological continuity.[40] His make-up as an old man required four to six hours of preparation.[40] After a few weeks Nilo Jacoponi, Manlio Rocchetti and Gino Zamprioli replaced Christopher Tucker,  whose make-up was considered excessive and unrealistic by Leone.[40]\n\n### Editing\n\nBy the end of filming, Leone had ten hours worth of footage. With his editor, Nino Baragli, Leone trimmed this to almost six hours, and he originally wanted to release the film in two parts.[41] The producers refused, partly because of the commercial and critical failure of Bernardo Bertolucci's two-part 1900, and Leone was forced to further shorten it.[42] The film was originally 269 minutes (4 hours and 29 minutes), but when the film premiered out of competition at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, Leone had cut it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes) to appease the distributors, which was the version shown in European cinemas.[43]\n\n### Music\n\nThe musical score was composed by Leone's longtime collaborator Ennio Morricone. \"Deborah's Theme\" was written for a Franco Zeffirelli film but was rejected.[44] The score is also notable for Morricone's incorporation of the music of Gheorghe Zamfir, who plays a pan flute.[44] Zamfir's flute music was used to similar effect in Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975).[41][45] Morricone also collaborated with vocalist Edda Dell'Orso on the score.\n\n| Once Upon a Time in America         | Once Upon a Time in America                     |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Soundtrack album by Ennio Morricone | Soundtrack album by Ennio Morricone             |\n| Released                            | June 1, 1984 October 17, 1995 (Special edition) |\n| Recorded                            | December 1983                                   |\n| Studio                              | Forum Studios, Rome                             |\n| Genre                               | Contemporary classical                          |\n| Label                               | Mercury Records                                 |\n| Producer                            | Ennio Morricone                                 |\n|                                     |                                                 |\n| Special Edition cover               | Special Edition cover                           |\n|                                     |                                                 |\n|                                     |                                                 |\n\nBesides the original music, the film used source music, including:[46]\n\n- \"God Bless America\" (written by Irving Berlin, performed by Kate Smith – 1943) – Plays over the opening credits from a radio in Eve's bedroom and briefly at the film's ending.\n- \"Yesterday\" (written by Lennon–McCartney – 1965) – A Muzak version of this piece plays when Noodles first returns to New York in 1968, examining himself in a train station mirror. An instrumental version of the song also plays briefly during the dialogue scene between Noodles and \"Bailey\" towards the end of the film.\n- \"Summertime\" (written by George Gershwin – 1935) An instrumental version of the aria from the opera Porgy and Bess is playing softly in the background as Noodles, just before leaving, explains to \"Secretary Bailey\" why he could never kill his friend.\n- \"Amapola\" (written by Joseph Lacalle, American lyrics by Albert Gamse – 1923) – Originally an opera piece, several instrumental versions of this song were played during the film; a jazzy version, which was played on the gramophone danced to by young Deborah in 1918; a similar version played by Fat Moe's jazz band in the speakeasy in 1930; and a string version, during Noodles' date with Deborah. Both versions are available on the soundtrack.\n- Part of the third theme from the overture to La gazza ladra (Gioachino Rossini – 1817) – Used during the baby-switching scene in the hospital.\n- \"Night and Day\" (written and sung by Cole Porter – 1932) – Played by a jazz band during the beach scene before the beachgoers receive word of Prohibition's repeal, and during the party at the house of \"Secretary Bailey\" in 1968.\n- \"St. James Infirmary Blues\" is used during the Prohibition \"funeral\" at the gang's speakeasy.\n\nA soundtrack album was released in 1984 by Mercury Records.[47] This was followed by a special-edition release in 1995, featuring four additional tracks.[48]\n\n|   No. | Title                         | Length   |\n|-------|-------------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Once Upon a Time in America\" | 2:11     |\n|     2 | \"Poverty\"                     | 3:37     |\n|     3 | \"Deborah's Theme\"             | 4:24     |\n|     4 | \"Childhood Memories\"          | 3:22     |\n|     5 | \"Amapola\"                     | 5:21     |\n|     6 | \"Friends\"                     | 1:34     |\n|     7 | \"Prohibition Dirge\"           | 4:20     |\n\n|   No. | Title                       | Length   |\n|-------|-----------------------------|----------|\n|     8 | \"Cockeye's Song\"            | 4:20     |\n|     9 | \"Amapola, Part II\"          | 3:07     |\n|    10 | \"Childhood Poverty\"         | 1:41     |\n|    11 | \"Photographic Memories\"     | 1:00     |\n|    12 | \"Friends – Reprise\"         | 1:23     |\n|    13 | \"Friendship &amp; Love\"         | 4:14     |\n|    14 | \"Speakeasy\"                 | 2:21     |\n|    15 | \"Deborah's Theme – Amapola\" | 6:13     |\n\n|   No. | Title                                                       | Length   |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|    16 | \"Suite from Once Upon a Time in America (Includes Amapola)\" | 13:32    |\n|    17 | \"Poverty (Temp.

One among them later confronted Robert De Niro in a press conference and made harsh comments to the film's depiction, describing it as \"blatant, gratuitous violence\".[54] In general, the rape scenes specifically were controversial.[55] Richard Godden defended Leone's representation of rape, saying that it \"articulates the dysfunction between bodies in images and bodies themselves\". Of the scene in which De Niro's character rapes her character, Elizabeth McGovern said it \"didn't glamorize violent sex: it is extremely uncomfortable to watch and it is meant to be\". She went on to state:[56]\n\nAnd if you say, \"this violence is wrong\", you'd have to enlarge that to say, \"all violence in movies in wrong\", and then you'd have to say, \"you can only make movies about good people who obey the law and do right things\" which a) excludes a lot of what life is and b) makes for some very boring movies.\n\nIn his book, Leone scholar Christopher Frayling argues that the movie's central gang are all emotionally stunted: \"like small boys obsessed with their equipment who have no idea how to relate to flesh-and-blood women\".[57]\n\n### Versions\n\n#### US version\n\nThe film was shown in limited release and for film critics in North America, where it was slightly trimmed to secure an \"R\" rating. Cuts were made to two rape scenes and some of the more graphic violence at the beginning. Noodles' meeting with Bailey in 1968 was also excised. The film gained a mediocre reception at several sneak premieres in North America. Because of this early audience reaction, the fear of its length, its graphic violence, and the inability of theaters to have multiple showings in one day, The Ladd Company cut entire scenes and removed approximately 90 minutes of the film,[23] without the supervision of Sergio Leone.\n\nThis American wide release (1984, 139 minutes) was drastically different from the European release, as the non-chronological story was rearranged into chronological order. Other major cuts involved many of the childhood sequences, making the adult 1933 sections more prominent. Noodles' 1968 meeting with Deborah was excised, and the scene with Bailey ends with him shooting himself (with the sound of a gunshot off screen) rather than the garbage truck conclusion of the 229-minute version.[58][page needed] Sergio Leone's daughter, Raffaella Leone, said that Leone had dismissed the US version as not his own movie.[59]\n\n#### USSR\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the film was shown theatrically in the late 1980s, with other Hollywood blockbusters such as the two King Kong films. The story was rearranged in chronological order and the film was split in two, with the two parts shown as separate movies, one containing the childhood scenes and the other comprising the adulthood scenes. Despite the rearranging, no major scene deletions were made.[60]\n\n#### Restored original\n\nRobert De Niro and Elizabeth McGovern at the screening of the film's restored version, during the 2012 Cannes Film Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn March 2011, it was announced that Leone's original 269-minute version was to be re-created by a film lab in Italy under the supervision of Leone's children, who had acquired the Italian distribution rights, and the film's original sound editor, Fausto Ancillai, for a premiere in 2012 at either the Cannes Film Festival or Venice Film Festival.[61][62]\n\nThe restored film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, but because of unforeseen rights issues for the deleted scenes, the restoration had a runtime of only 251 minutes.[63][64][65] However, Martin Scorsese (whose Film Foundation helped with the restoration) stated that he was helping Leone's children gain the rights to the final 24 minutes of deleted scenes to create a complete restoration of Leone's envisaged 269-minute version. On August 3, 2012, it was reported that after the premiere at Cannes, the restored film was pulled from circulation, pending further restoration work.[66]\n\n#### Home media\n\nIn North America, a two-tape VHS was released by Warner Home Video with a runtime of 226 minutes in February 1985 and 1991. The U.S. theatrical cut was also released at the same time in February 1985.[67] A two-disc special edition was released on June 10, 2003, featuring the 229-minute version of the film.[68] This special edition was re-released on January 11, 2011, on both DVD and Blu-ray.[69] On September 30, 2014, Warner Bros. released a two-disc Blu-ray and DVD set of the 251-minute restoration shown at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, dubbed the Extended Director's Cut.[70] This version was previously released in Italy, on September 4, 2012.[71]\n\n## Critical reception\n\nThe initial critical response to Once Upon a Time in America was mixed, because of the different versions released worldwide. While internationally the film was well received in its original form, American critics were much more dissatisfied with the 139-minute version released in North America. This condensed version was a critical and financial disaster,[72] and many American critics who knew of Leone's original cut attacked the short version.\n\nSome critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas, saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. In his 1984 review, Roger Ebert gave the uncut version four stars out of four and wrote that it was \"an epic poem of violence and greed\", but described the American theatrical version as a \"travesty\".[12] Furthermore, he gave the American theatrical version one star out of four, calling it \"an incomprehensible mess without texture, timing, mood, or sense\".[73] Ebert's television film critic partner Gene Siskel considered the uncut version to be the best film of 1984 and the shortened, linear studio version to be the worst film of 1984.[74] Vincent Canby of The New York Times criticized the nonlinear narrative that is structured throughout the film.[75]\n\nIt was only after Leone's death and the subsequent restoration of the original version that critics began to give it the kind of praise displayed at its original Cannes showing. The uncut original film is considered to be far superior to the edited version released in the U.S. in 1984.[76] Ebert, in his review of Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, called the original uncut version of Once Upon a Time in America the best film depicting the Prohibition era.[77] James Woods, who considers it to be Leone's finest film, mentioned in the DVD documentary that one critic dubbed the film the worst of 1984, only to see the original cut years later and call it the best of the 1980s.[60] Some were critical towards the movie's graphic violence and cruelty, with Donald Clarke of The Irish Times condemning it as a \"fistful of misogyny\" and \"offensively sexist\".[78]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Once Upon a Time in America has an approval rating of 86% based on 56 reviews, with an average score of 8.60/10. The website's critic consensus reads: \"Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting, and filled with great performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and James Woods.\"[79] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[80]\n\nThe film has since been ranked as one of the best films of the gangster genre. In Empire magazine, critic Adam Smith compared the film favourably to The Godfather, saying: \"Leone's film is arguably the better of the two – if the less popular – eschewing, as it does, the soapy melodramatics of Coppola's family saga in favour of less audience-friendly, but more intriguing, ambiguity and symbolism.\"[81]\n\nWhen Sight &amp; Sound asked several UK critics in 2002 what their favorite films of the last 25 years were, Once Upon a Time in America placed at number 10.[82] In 2015, the film was ranked at number nine on Time Out's list of the 50 best gangster films of all time,[83] while in 2021, The Guardian cited it as the fourth greatest mobster film ever made.[84] In 2023, The A.V. Club  ranked it seventh in its list of the greatest gangster movies of all time.[85]\n\n### Accolades\n\nUnlike its modern critical success, the initial American release did not fare well with critics and received no Academy Award nominations.[86] The film's music was disqualified from Oscar consideration for a technicality,[87] as the studio accidentally omitted the composer's name from the opening credits when trimming its running time for the American release.[60]\n\n| Award                                                | Category                          | Nominee            | Result    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|\n| 38th British Academy Film Awards[88]                 | Best Costume Design               | Gabriella Pescucci | Won       |\n| 38th British Academy Film Awards[88]                 | Best Film Music                   | Ennio Morricone    | Won       |\n| 38th British Academy Film Awards[88]                 | Best Direction                    | Sergio Leone       | Nominated |\n| 38th British Academy Film Awards[88]                 | Best Actress in a Supporting Role | Tuesday Weld       | Nominated |\n| 38th British Academy Film Awards[88]                 | Best Cinematography               | Tonino Delli Colli | Nominated |\n| 42nd Golden Globe Awards[89]                         | Best Director                     | Sergio Leone       | Nominated |\n| 42nd Golden Globe Awards[89]                         | Best Original Score               | Ennio Morricone    | Nominated |\n| 8th Japan Academy Film Prize[90]                     | Outstanding Foreign Language Film | –                  | Won       |\n| 10th Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards[91] | Best Film                         | –                  | Nominated |\n| 10th Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards[91] | Best Director                     | Sergio Leone       | Nominated |\n| 10th Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards[91] | Best Music Score                  | Ennio Morricone    | Won       |\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films cut over the director's opposition\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Carlson, Michael (October 28, 2009). \"Stuart Kaminsky obituary\".

Noodles is drugging himself in an opium den with a newspaper next to him featuring the death of bootleggers Patrick Goldberg, Philip Stein, and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz. He recalls the police removing their corpses, one burnt beyond recognition. Noodles evades capture and leaves the city.\n\n        In 1918, David \"Noodles\" Aaronson leads a gang of him and his three friends \"Patsy\" Goldberg, \"Cockeye\" Stein and Dominic, performing jobs for local gangster Bugsy. They meet Max as he foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by corrupt police officer Whitey. Max joins their gang and they later blackmail Whitey and get the same police protection as Bugsy.\n\n        The gang becomes successful liquor smugglers. They deposit their earnings in a locker, giving the key to a friend of theirs, Moe. Noodles is in love with Moe's sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer. Due to his socialization as a gangster, Deborah sees no future for their love. Bugsy, now a rival, ambushes the gang and fatally shoots Dominic. Noodles kills Bugsy and is sentenced to prison.\n\n        Upon his release a decade later, Noodles rejoins his gang. During a diamond heist they use jewellery employee Carol as their informant. She goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later becomes Max's girlfriend. Noodles realizes that the heist was commissioned by a syndicate figure to eliminate competition. This leads to tensions between Max and Noodles, who seeks independence. The gang provides protection for Teamsters' union boss O'Donnell, during the course of which they exchange newborns at a clinic, punishing the head of the police whose wife has just given birth to a boy at that clinic. This results in the police withdrawing their actions against striking workers.\n\n        Noodles takes Deborah on a lavish date. When she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood, he snaps and rapes her. As she departs the next day, he attempts to catch a glance of her sitting on the train, but she avoids eye contact.\n\n        The repeal of Prohibition forces the gang to look for alternative activities. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem too risky. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out. Upon regaining consciousness, Noodles learns that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police during the heist, as established at the beginning of the film. A guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. During his subsequent escape, he realizes the locker money has disappeared.\n\n        In the 1960s, Noodles returns to Manhattan for the first time since the 1930s after receiving a letter indicating that his identity has been uncovered, seeking to find out who is responsible. He learns that the bodies of his three friends have been relocated to Riverdale. He visits their mausoleum in Riverdale and finds a key to a railway locker.\n\n        The locker reveals a suitcase full of money, stated to be the advance on his next job. Noodles learns of the corruption scandals around Senator Christopher Bailey and visits Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and that Max opened fire first, wishing to die young. Noodles spots Deborah in a memorial photograph, who has become a major actress, and starts to suspect a connection between Deborah and Bailey. He tracks down Deborah and visits her, telling her about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion and challenging her to tell him about the mysterious job as well as the identity of Bailey. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave the city before facing hurtful revelations. Ignoring her advice, Noodles leaves her after seeing Bailey's son, who looks like the young Max.\n\n        Noodles meets Bailey, who turns out to be Max. Having faked his death, Max stole the gang's money and reinvented himself as a self-made businessman. He also made Deborah his mistress, thus robbing Noodles of everything he had. Faced with ruin due to the corruption scandal, Max reveals that he is behind the mysterious job, which is for Noodles to kill him. Noodles refuses. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck passes and a man, presumably Max, walks toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck's auger conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <CriticalReception>\n        The initial critical response to Once Upon a Time in America was mixed, because of the different versions released worldwide. While internationally the film was well received in its original form, American critics were much more dissatisfied with the 139-minute version released in North America. This condensed version was a critical and financial disaster, and many American critics who knew of Leone's original cut attacked the short version.\n\n        Some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas, saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. In his 1984 review, Roger Ebert gave the uncut version four stars out of four and wrote that it was \"an epic poem of violence and greed\", but described the American theatrical version as a \"travesty\". Furthermore, he gave the American theatrical version one star out of four, calling it \"an incomprehensible mess without texture, timing, mood, or sense\". Ebert's television film critic partner Gene Siskel considered the uncut version to be the best film of 1984 and the shortened, linear studio version to be the worst film of 1984.\n\n        It was only after Leone's death and the subsequent restoration of the original version that critics began to give it the kind of praise displayed at its original Cannes showing. The uncut original film is considered to be far superior to the edited version released in the U.S. in 1984. Ebert, in his review of Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, called the original uncut version of Once Upon a Time in America the best film depicting the Prohibition era.\n    </CriticalReception>\n</OnceUponATimeInAmerica>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key information is highlighted with appropriate XML tags while maintaining the original meaning and context of the article.",

It stars Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt as the Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, alongside Tom Skerritt, Brenda Blethyn and Emily Lloyd.\n\nSet in and around Missoula, Montana, the story follows two sons of a Presbyterian minister, one studious and the other rebellious, as they grow up and come of age in the Rocky Mountain region during a span of time from roughly World War I to the early days of the Great Depression, including part of the Prohibition era.[2]\n\nThe film premiered at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released in the United States on October 9. It received positive reviews and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, and won Best Cinematography. Robert Redford was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, grow up in Missoula, Montana, with their mother, Clara, and their father, Rev. John Maclean, a Presbyterian minister, from whom they learn a love of fly fishing for trout in the Blackfoot River. Norman and Paul are home-schooled under the strict moral and academic code of their father. Norman leaves to attend college at Dartmouth. Six years later, during the Prohibition era and the Jazz Age, he returns and finds that Paul has become a skilled fisherman and a hard-drinking investigative journalist working for a newspaper in Helena.\n\nNorman attends a Fourth of July dance and meets Jessie Burns, a flapper whose father runs the general store in Wolf Creek. Smitten, Norman calls her the next morning and sets up a double date. Norman and Jessie go on their first date at the Hot Springs speakeasy. Paul arrives with his date, a similarly hard-drinking Cheyenne woman named Mabel, who is treated as an inferior by the white crowd.\n\nAfter Paul is arrested for hitting a man who insulted Mabel, Norman is called to bail him out of jail. The desk sergeant says that Paul has angered local criminals by falling behind in his debts from a big poker game at the Lolo speakeasy. Norman offers to give money to Paul, who brushes him off.\n\nJessie eventually asks Norman to help her alcoholic brother Neal, who is visiting from Southern California. Norman and Paul dislike Neal, but at Jessie's insistence they invite him to go fly fishing. Neal shows up drunk with Rawhide, a prostitute he met the night before. Norman and Paul get separated from Neal but fish anyway and return to their car hours later to find that Neal and Rawhide have drunk all the beer, had sex, and passed out naked.\n\nNorman drives an intoxicated Neal home, where Jessie is enraged that the brothers left Neal alone with the beer instead of fishing with him. Norman tells Jessie that he is falling in love with her. Jessie drives away angry but a week later asks Norman to come to the train station to see Neal off. After the train departs, Jessie laments her failure to save Neal from his alcoholism. Norman shows Jessie a letter from the University of Chicago offering him a faculty position in the Department of English Literature. He tells Jessie that he does not wish to leave Montana and when it becomes clear that it is because of her, she embraces him.\n\nThat night, a drunken Norman meets up with Paul and announces his love for Jessie. Paul says that they should celebrate but instead takes Norman to the Lolo speakeasy. Paul tries to get in on the poker game in the backroom, but the dealer will not let him play because he already owes so much. Paul tells Norman that he is not leaving since he is feeling lucky and that he will convince the others to let him play. Norman reluctantly drives off after Paul asks him to go fishing the next day.\n\nBlackfoot River\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorman is relieved when Paul arrives the following morning, as he feared for his brother's life. Norman tells his family that he is going to accept the job in Chicago. Norman, Paul, and their father go fly fishing one last time. Norman urges his brother to come with him and Jessie to Chicago, but Paul says that he will never leave Montana. He hooks a huge rainbow trout that drags him down the river rapids before he lands it. Rev. Maclean says that Paul has become a wonderful fisherman and an artist in the craft, much to Paul's delight.\n\nBefore Norman is to leave for Chicago, police inform him that Paul was beaten to death. Norman breaks the news to his parents. Years later, Mrs. Maclean, Norman, Jessie, and their two children listen to a sermon given by Rev. Maclean soon before his own death. Rev. Maclean preaches about being unable to help loved ones who are destroying themselves and will not accept help. All that those who truly care for such a self-destructive person can do, Rev. Maclean concludes, is to give unconditional love, even without understanding why.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Craig Sheffer as Norman Maclean\n    - Joseph Gordon-Levitt as young Norman\n    - Robert Redford as the voice of older Norman\n- Brad Pitt as Paul Maclean\n    - Vann Gravage as young Paul\n- Tom Skerritt as Reverend Maclean\n- Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Maclean\n- Emily Lloyd as Jessie Burns\n- Edie McClurg as Mrs. Burns\n- Stephen Shellen as Neal Burns\n- Nicole Burdette as Mabel\n- Susan Traylor as Rawhide\n- Michael Cudlitz as Chub\n- William Hootkins as Murphy\n\n## Production\n\n### Pre-production\n\nIn 1976, the same year the novella A River Runs Through It and Other Stories was published, Richard Sylbert optioned the film rights to it, with William Hjortsberg attached as writer. However, the option gradually lapsed without further updates on the adaptation. This made author Norman Maclean distrustful of Hollywood, with any further attempts to option the novella, including one by William Hurt, being met with immediate reluctance from Maclean for the next ten years.[1]\n\nRobert Redford, who had read the novella in 1980, said he was \"immediately captivated by it\", appreciating Maclean's depiction of the American West and feeling a strong connection to the Scottish immigrant protagonists, being of Scottish-Irish heritage himself. Over the course of six weeks, Redford and Maclean met thrice to discuss the former's vision for a film adaptation. Maclean was impressed, granting Redford an option which allowed Maclean first-draft script approval. However, Maclean died in August 1990, before production even began on the film, leading to surviving family members including his daughter and son-in-law to discuss the script instead. In October 1987, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner reported that Redford's Northfork Productions would produce the adaptation; John Sacret Young was initially attached as screenwriter, but neither was he mentioned in further updates, nor is he credited onscreen.[1]\n\nProvisions of finance and distribution for A River Runs Through It had been precarious for much of the pre-production stage. Northfork and Cineplex Odeon entered a joint venture in October 1987 to co-finance low budget films in the $5-6 million range, this film being one of them, but this arrangement fell through when Cineplex Odeon's distribution arm collapsed. Eventually, Carolco Pictures agreed to finance the film under the condition that Redford kept the budget below $10 million and agreed to act in one of their future films. The company would also acquire worldwide distribution rights, with domestic distribution handled by Seven Arts, Carolco's joint venture with New Line Cinema. However, owing to financial troubles, Carolco dropped out as well. Finally, Jake Eberts, who had been trying to option the novel previously, immediately joined as financier when Redford took the project to Allied Filmmakers; Variety initially reported that Carolco would co-finance and retain worldwide distribution, but the company ultimately dropped out of the project.[1]\n\nScreenwriter Richard Friedenberg was initially skeptical about adapting the novella and turned it down, fearing he would write a \"fishing movie\". Friedenberg ultimately signed on, conducting extensive research, with Maclean's surviving daughter and son-in-law providing him with old yearbooks and love letters between Maclean and his wife Jessie. Friedenberg's screenplay made some changes to the novella, including rearranging chronological events and shortening them into a smaller time frame and making the details of Paul Maclean's murder clearer than they were in the novella. Wanting to preserve Maclean's language from the original, Redford made the decision to add narration using lines from the novella verbatim. For this purpose, he auditioned 26 actors and author Wallace Stegner. Unsatisfied with the auditions, Redford decided to provide narration himself, despite concerns over it coming off as egocentric and self-indulgent.[1]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe Redeemer Lutheran Church in Livingston, Montana, used for the Presbyterian church scenes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough both the book and movie are set in Missoula and on the Blackfoot River, it was filmed in late June to early July 1991 in south central Montana in Livingston and Bozeman,[2]  and on the nearby upper Yellowstone, Gallatin, and Boulder Rivers.  The waterfall shown is Granite Falls, in the mountains 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Jackson, Wyoming.[3][4] Filming was completed in early September 1991.\n\nAn article published in the Helena Independent Record in July 2000, based on recollections of people who knew both brothers, noted a number of specifics about the Macleans — notably various chronological and educational details about Paul Maclean's adult life — that differ somewhat from their portrayal in the film and novella.[5]\n\n### Music\n\nMark Isham, who would go on to compose the scores to most Robert Redford-directed films, composed the musical score for the film. Originally, Elmer Bernstein was hired to score the film. However, after Redford and Bernstein disagreed over the tone of the music, Bernstein was replaced by Isham.[6] Rushed for time, Isham completed the score within four weeks at Schnee Studio of Signet Sound Studios in Hollywood, California. Upon release, the music was met with positive reviews earning the film nominations for both Grammy and Academy Awards. The A River Runs Through It (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on October 27, 1992.[7]\n\n## Release\n\nCineplex Odeon as well as Carolco Pictures and its company Seven Arts were attached as distributors of the film at various points during pre-production. Michael Nathanson, worldwide production president at Columbia Pictures, kept close contact with Redford for one and a half years before the studio was shown a rough cut of the film. Columbia ultimately won the domestic distribution rights to it for $8 million in May 1992, beating out Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Studios; this would mark Columbia's first acquisition of a completed film since Mark Canton became its head in 1991.[1]\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 1992, followed by benefit screenings in Bozeman, Montana on September 19 and at the AMPAS Theater on October 2. The film's Bozeman screening raised several thousand dollars, donated towards the restoration of the Big Blackfoot River, while the AMPAS screening raised $45,000 for Redford's Sundance Institute. Its limited theatrical release began in the United States on October 9, 1992 with twelve screens, which doubled the following week and expanded to 130 in the third week. On October 30, 1992, having grossed $2.9 million domestically in 19 days, the number of screens expanded to 800.[8][1]\n\n### Home media\n\nA River Runs Through It was originally released on VHS and LaserDisc on May 19, 1993.[9] It was released on DVD in 1999 and a deluxe DVD edition in 2005 in similar packaging style as Legends Of The Fall, which also received a deluxe edition dvd release that year.[10] It was reissued on Blu-ray in July 2009 by Sony Pictures with six extra features including 17 deleted scenes and a documentary titled Deep Currents: Making 'A River Runs Through It' with interview segments of the cast and crew.[11]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nReleased on October 9, 1992, the film grossed $43,440,294 in the United States and Canada.[12] In 1993, it grossed $22.9 million for a worldwide total of over $66 million.[13]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.79/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Tasteful to a fault, this period drama combines a talented cast (including a young Brad Pitt) with some stately, beautifully filmed work from director Robert Redford.\"[14] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[15] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[16]\n\nRoger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. He wrote:\n\nRedford and his writer, Richard Friedenberg, understand that most of the events in any life are accidential or arbitrary, especially the crucial ones, and we can exercise little conscious control over our destinies.[17]\n\nMuch of the praise focused on Pitt's portrayal of Paul, which has been cited as his career-making performance.[18] Despite the critical reception, Pitt was very critical of his performance on the film: \"Robert Redford made a quality movie. But I don't think I was skilled enough. I think I could have done better. Maybe it was the pressure of the part, and playing someone who was a real person — and the family was around occasionally — and not wanting to let Redford down.\"[19]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                           | Category                                                                     | Nominee(s)                                                    | Result    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| 20/20 Awards                                    | Best Adapted Screenplay                                                      | Richard Friedenberg                                           | Nominated |\n| 20/20 Awards                                    | Best Cinematography                                                          | Philippe Rousselot                                            | Nominated |\n| Academy Awards[20]                              | Best Screenplay – Based on Material Previously Produced or Published         | Richard Friedenberg                                           | Nominated |\n| Academy Awards[20]                              | Best Cinematography                                                          | Philippe Rousselot                                            | Won       |\n| Academy Awards[20]                              | Best Original Score                                                          | Mark Isham                                                    | Nominated |\n| American Society of Cinematographers Awards     | Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases             | Philippe Rousselot                                            | Nominated |\n| Artios Awards[21]                               | Best Casting for Feature Film – Drama                                        | Elisabeth Leustig                                             | Nominated |\n| Awards Circuit Community Awards                 | Best Cinematography                                                          | Philippe Rousselot                                            | Nominated |\n| Awards Circuit Community Awards                 | Best Original Score                                                          | Mark Isham                                                    | Nominated |\n| Golden Globe Awards[22]                         | Best Director – Motion Picture                                               | Robert Redford                                                | Nominated |\n| Grammy Awards[23]                               | Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television | Mark Isham                                                    | Nominated |\n| Kinema Junpo Awards                             | Best Foreign Language Film                                                   | Robert Redford                                                | Won       |\n| Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards[24] | Best Music Score                                                             | Mark Isham                                                    | Runner-up |\n| USC Scripter Awards[25]                         | USC Scripter Awards[25]                                                      | Richard Friedenberg (screenwriter);   Norman Maclean (author) | Won       |\n| Young Artist Awards[26]                         | Best Young Actor Under 10 in a Motion Picture                                | Joseph Gordon-Levitt                                          | Won       |\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe following quote from the film, which is not present in the novella, is displayed at the base of the statue of Michael Jordan at Chicago's United Center:\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f g \"AFI-Catalog\". catalog.afi.com.

It stars Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt as the Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, alongside Tom Skerritt, Brenda Blethyn, and Emily Lloyd.\n        \n        Set in and around Missoula, Montana, the story follows two sons of a Presbyterian minister, one studious and the other rebellious, as they grow up and come of age in the Rocky Mountain region during a span of time from roughly World War I to the early days of the Great Depression, including part of the Prohibition era.\n        \n        The film premiered at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on October 9. It received positive reviews and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, and won Best Cinematography. Robert Redford was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Craig Sheffer as Norman Maclean</Actor>\n        <Actor>Brad Pitt as Paul Maclean</Actor>\n        <Actor>Tom Skerritt as Reverend Maclean</Actor>\n        <Actor>Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Maclean</Actor>\n        <Actor>Emily Lloyd as Jessie Burns</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    \n    <Production>\n        <PreProduction>\n            In 1976, the same year the novella A River Runs Through It and Other Stories was published, Richard Sylbert optioned the film rights to it, with William Hjortsberg attached as writer. However, the option gradually lapsed without further updates on the adaptation. This made author Norman Maclean distrustful of Hollywood, with any further attempts to option the novella, including one by William Hurt, being met with immediate reluctance from Maclean for the next ten years.\n        </PreProduction>\n        \n        <Filming>\n            Although both the book and movie are set in Missoula and on the Blackfoot River, it was filmed in late June to early July 1991 in south central Montana in Livingston and Bozeman, and on the nearby upper Yellowstone, Gallatin, and Boulder Rivers.\n        </Filming>\n        \n        <Music>\n            Mark Isham composed the musical score for the film. Originally, Elmer Bernstein was hired to score the film. However, after Redford and Bernstein disagreed over the tone of the music, Bernstein was replaced by Isham.\n        </Music>\n    </Production>\n    \n    <Release>\n        The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 1992, followed by benefit screenings in Bozeman, Montana on September 19 and at the AMPAS Theater on October 2. Its limited theatrical release began in the United States on October 9, 1992.\n    </Release>\n    \n    <Reception>\n        <BoxOffice>\n            Released on October 9, 1992, the film grossed $43,440,294 in the United States and Canada.

It's suspenseful, funny, charming, sad, and magical... all in less than two hours. The story is simple for being such an all-encompassing film.\n\nThe use of lighting and shadows intrigued the heck out of me, along with the staging. The beginning especially. I hadn't seen the movie all the way through before and I had never seen the establishing shots.\n\nI didn't expect the first sequence to be the aliens leaving E.T. behind. But it makes sense for the story.\n\nHowever, it isn't JUST that E.T. gets left behind. Below are my studies of the first sequence. (Read by column, not by left-to-right, sorry!)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe beginning establishes several things – First and most importantly, E.T. is a friendly alien. Not the Independence-Day-We-Are-Going-to-Kill-You kind of alien. He's also curious, enjoys plants, likes to make things grow, and is fond of young trees. His species communicate telepathically with the heart, which beats with a red light sometimes.\n\nWe get a sense that he is small in scale when he looks up at the trees and not menacing enough to scare even a rabbit.\n\nThe film shows all this without ever getting close up and focused on the aliens themselves. It leaves a mystery, gives us a little suspense. Quite possibly one of the richest beginnings to a film I've ever seen. It's a perfect hook to get us to sit and watch the rest of the movie.\n\n### The staging.\n\nThere are many many scenes where there are multiple characters in a shot. I tried to pay special attention to how the characters were staged. Very rarely were two characters parallel to each other. For example:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn many of the shots with multiple characters, they formed a sort of triangle in the composition.\n\n### The Lighting:\n\nThe soft, almost ethereal glow of light played a huge role in what we should fear. Because we already know that E.T. is harmless, the threat then becomes those that would hurt E.T. or take him away from Elliott. Which would be the human scientists.\n\nHow do you make scientists feel scary? Set the camera low, as if it was hiding in a child's bedroom and give the scientists a flashlight and identity-hiding plastic suits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe shadows equally play a massive role. Most of the film, Elliott hides E.T. in the shadows, where lamps were strategically placed to illuminate a face, but keep the rest in darkness. For example:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the lighting so specific, silhouettes were in abundance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI especially like that last shot with Elliott and his brother Michael, knowing E.T. is alive. The sequence before had been lit very somberly. Contrast that with the specific lighting above the boys, and you get the sense that hope is rising and the boys begin to concoct a plan.\n\n### The Story\n\nAll this talk about cinematic lighting and staging, and I haven't really talked about the story at all.\n\nBrian McDonald, in his book Invisible Ink, asserts that E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is about a selfish boy learning to empathize with others. I agree with that assertion. If you'd like to know more, I suggest reading the book because it's fantastic and will likely change your life.\n\nI also want to point out that there are many unexplained things that happen in the story. Things that we don't see or necessarily understand. One of them is how E.T. came back to life. While the movie hints that it's because of the spaceship approaching Earth, it never specifically says that's how he 'reincarnated' himself.\n\nHe kind of has some Jesus imagery happening here with the white blanket and halo of light. Not to mention the warm red heart.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother example might be when Michael, Elliott's brother, rescues E.T. from the icy waters of the forest. There is no explanation or scene about how he was able to return with E.T. to the house even though there were helicopters flying overhead. I think that was smart cutting there.\n\nPerhaps one of the most intriguing mysteries would be how exactly Elliott and E.T. were biologically linked. It just happens and there are questions about it, even the scientists mention it, but those questions are never answered.\n\nSo... this film is ripe for some hypothesizing.\n\nIn all, I think this movie is classic and will stay that way. It has its own kind of magic. I will have to study it again and again. I have a feeling there are layers upon layers of techniques and decisions that will blow my mind. What did you think of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial? Did anything blow your mind?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Latest Posts\n\nWant free art and stories? Love young adult fantasy and fine art?

Brooks, adapted from Larry McMurtry's 1975 novel of the same name. It stars Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Jeff Daniels, and John Lithgow. The film covers 30 years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway (MacLaine) and her daughter Emma Greenway-Horton (Winger).\n\nTerms of Endearment was theatrically released in limited theatres on November 23, 1983, and to a wider release on December 9 by Paramount Pictures. The film received critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, grossing $165 million at the box office, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1983 (after Return of the Jedi). At the 56th Academy Awards, the film received a leading 11 nominations, and won a leading five awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (MacLaine), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Nicholson). A sequel, The Evening Star, was released in 1996.\n\n## Plot\n\nAurora Greenway, a widow since her daughter Emma was a young girl, keeps several suitors at arm's length in River Oaks, Houston, focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with Emma. Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries callow young college professor Flap Horton over her mother's objections.\n\nDespite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along with each other, Emma and Aurora have very close ties and keep in touch by telephone. Soon after the wedding, Emma gets pregnant with their first child. He is a few years old when she is again expecting another.\n\nThe small family moves to Iowa in order for Flap to pursue a career as an English professor. When they run into financial difficulties, Emma calls Aurora for help. Admitting she is pregnant with a third, her mother suggests she go to Colorado for an abortion.\n\nWhen Flap gets home, as he was away overnight, Emma demands to be told if he is having an affair. He insists it is paranoia, brought on by the pregnancy hormones. While at the grocery store, Emma does not have enough money to pay for all of her groceries and meets Sam Burns, who helps pay for them.\n\nMeanwhile the lonely Aurora, after her doctor discloses her real age at her birthday celebration, overcomes her repression and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove, who is promiscuous and coarse. Simultaneously Emma and Sam strike up a friendship and quickly an affair as Sam's wife refuses to have sex with him, and she suspects Flap of infidelity.\n\nOver the course of the next few years, the marriage begins to fray. Emma catches Flap flirting with one of his students on campus, so drives back to Houston immediately. There, Garrett develops cold feet about his relationship with Aurora after seeing her with her daughter and grandkids and breaks it off.\n\nWhile Emma is gone, Flap accepts a promotion in Nebraska; she and the children return to Iowa, then they move to Nebraska. While on the campus, Emma sees the same young woman who she had seen Flap with in Iowa. Confronting her, she finds out he moved them to Nebraska so he could work with his girlfriend Janice.\n\nWhen Emma is diagnosed with cancer, before she knows how advanced it is, her lifelong friend Patsy convinces her to explore NYC. She is there a short time when Patsy's friends there first find it strange she has never worked then it gets more uncomfortable when they hear about the cancer. Not enjoying herself, she returns home early.\n\nWhen they discover it is terminal cancer, Aurora and Flap stay by Emma's side through her treatment and hospitalization. Garrett flies to Nebraska to be with Aurora and her family. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her children to Aurora's care.\n\nThe newly formed family, Aurora and the kids with Garrett, live together in Houston.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway\n- Debra Winger as Emma Greenway-Horton\n- Jack Nicholson as Garrett Breedlove\n- Danny DeVito as Vernon Dalhart\n- Jeff Daniels as Flap Horton\n- John Lithgow as Sam Burns\n- Lisa Hart Carroll as Patsy Clark\n- Huckleberry Fox as Ted \"Teddy\" Horton\n- Troy Bishop as Tom \"Tommy\" Horton\n    - Shane Sherwin as Tom \"Tommy\" Horton (toddler)\n- Megan Morris as Melanie Horton\n    - Tara Yeakey as Melanie Horton (infant)\n- Norman Bennett as Edward Johnson\n- Kate Charleson as Janice\n- Debi Richter as Leann\n- Mary Kay Place as Doris (voice)\n- David Wohl as Phil\n- Paul Menzel as Dr. Maise\n- Albert Brooks as Rudyard Greenway, Aurora's husband (voice only)\n\n## Production\n\nJames L. Brooks wrote the supporting role of Garrett Breedlove for Burt Reynolds, who turned down the role because of a verbal commitment he had made to appear in Stroker Ace. \"There are no awards in Hollywood for being an idiot\", Reynolds later said of the decision.[4] Harrison Ford and Paul Newman also turned down the role.[5][6]\n\nThe exterior shots of Aurora Greenway's home were filmed at 3060 Locke Lane, Houston, Texas. The exterior shots of locations intended to be in Des Moines, Iowa and Kearney, Nebraska were instead filmed in Lincoln, Nebraska. Many scenes were filmed on, or near, the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.[7] While filming in Lincoln, the state capital, Winger met then-governor of Nebraska Bob Kerrey; the two wound up dating for two years.[8]\n\nShirley MacLaine and Debra Winger reportedly did not get along with each other during production.[9][10][11][12] MacLaine confirmed in an interview that \"it was a very tough shoot ... Chaotic...(Jim) likes working with tension on the set.\"[13]\n\nOn working with Jack Nicholson, MacLaine said, \"Working with Jack Nicholson was crazy\",[14] but that his spontaneity may have contributed to her performance.[15] She also said,\n\nWe're like old smoothies working together. You know the old smoothies they used to show whenever you went to the Ice Follies. They would have this elderly man and woman – who at that time were 40 – and they had a little bit too much weight around the waist and were moving a little slower. But they danced so elegantly and so in synch with each other that the audience just laid back and sort of sighed. That's the way it is working with Jack. We both know what the other is going to do. And we don't socialize, or anything. It's an amazing chemistry – a wonderful, wonderful feeling.[12]\n\nMacLaine also confirmed in an interview with USA Today that Nicholson improvised when he put his hand down her dress in the beach scene.[16]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nTerms of Endearment was commercially successful at the box office. On its opening weekend, it grossed $3.4 million, ranking number two at the US box office, until its second weekend, when it grossed $3.1 million, ranking number one at the box office. Three weekends later, it arrived number one again, with $9,000,000, having wide release. For four weekends, it remained number one at the box office, and it slipped to number two on its tenth weekend. On the film's 11th weekend, it arrived number one (for the sixth and final time), grossing $3 million.[17] The film grossed $108,423,489 in the United States and Canada and $165 million worldwide.[18][2]\n\n### Critical reception\n\nTerms of Endearment received critical acclaim at the time of its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 82% approval rating based on 109 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.9/10. The site's consensus reads: \"A classic tearjerker, Terms of Endearment isn't shy about reaching for the heartstrings – but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it's almost impossible to resist.\"[19] Metacritic reports a score of 79 out of 100 based on reviews from ten critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[20]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, calling it \"a wonderful film\" and stating, \"There isn't a thing that I would change, and I was exhilarated by the freedom it gives itself to move from the high comedy of Nicholson's best moments to the acting of Debra Winger in the closing scenes.\"[21] Gene Siskel, who also gave the film a highly enthusiastic review, correctly predicted upon its release that it would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1983.\n\nIn his movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a rare four-star rating, calling it a \"Wonderful mix of humor and heartache,\" and concluded the film was \"Consistently offbeat and unpredictable, with exceptional performances by all three stars.\"[22]\n\n## Accolades\n\nAs of July 2022, Nicholson is one of the few supporting actors to ever sweep \"The Big Four\" critics awards (Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics) for his performance of Garrett Breedlove.\n\n| Award                                       | Category                                               | Nominee(s)                                                             | Result    |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards[23][24]                      | Best Picture                                           | James L.

            "title": "Theme: Religious Authority and the Small Town | Footloose Film Blog[1]",
            "content": "# Footloose Film Blog\n\n## A Blog Examining Footloose in the Context of Melodrama\n\n# Theme: Religious Authority and the Small Town\n\nNearly all forms of film-making and storytelling require the audience to suspend their disbelief; Footloose is no different. The opening sequence of Footloose is very important in introducing viewers to the characters, setting and the constraining atmosphere of the small town.\n\nMany critics consider the film’s plot to be implausible (Denisoff, Romanowski 405). How can a town ban dancing and music? With a solid opening sequence, the film can lessen its implausibility and increase its believability.\n\nIn essence, the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. As many critics declare, the film’s plot requires a great suspension of belief, so it is important that the opening scene effectively communicate the premise and establish the tone.\n\nIn the iconic opening sequence in Footloose, there is moving feet and catchy popular music.\n\nThe credit sequence in the beginning of the film introduces the viewer to the importance of music in the film.  In the opening sequence, moving ankles and dancing feet groove to upbeat rock music, and then the music and dancing ends abruptly. The silence following the scene is prolonged and creates a stark contrast between the lively city culture and the rural small town experience. The camera cuts to the image of a picturesque sky and mountain and farm landscape. The camera cuts to other rural scenes and then to the stern voice of a man preaching about the social problems concerning teenagers and the youth culture today interrupts the extreme quiet.  This opening sequence establishes the distinct  moral polarization of music and religion. One could not be righteous if he/she listens to popular music. As a character, Reverend Moore represents the moral authority of the small community. Reverend Moore is known around town as a kind of luminary, the person who will lead the rest of the community to ‘higher ground’ and out of harms way.\n\nThe scene in which the characters are dancing to “Dancing in the Sheets” ends when Ariel’s father, Reverend Moore turns off the radio. The camera focuses on his hand as he turns off the radio. The stillness of the moment is prolonged. Everyone dancing in the parking lot and the restaurant stop and turn to watch Ariel and her father. Everyone notices her father’s disappointment.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the shift that occurs partway through the film. In the beginning, there are negative attitudes towards popular music and dance, but towards the end, there is less of a stigma placed on popular music. Feuer adds that Footloose “begins by opposing dancing and community values, but ends with a merger between the values of community and the values of entertainment” (134). In this great juxtaposition, Herbert Ross encourages the audience to consider the impact of music on the characters’ relationships.\n\nAs previously stated, in the beginning of the film, the authorities reveal a general distaste for youth culture. In one particular scene of the film, towards the beginning, Amy, Ren’s young cousin says, “If you ask me, Ren’s a total fox.” In response, her parents and family gasp. Her father reprimands Amy and blames television and books as being the cause of what is influencing her to behave badly and speak provocatively. Reverend Moore  has supplied the townspeople with this answer to the youth’s misconduct. This film acts as a commentary and begs the viewers to answer the age-old question of which came first: The chicken or the egg? In this instance, teen delinquency/youthful disobedience is the chicken and popular media is the egg. Footloose brings viewers to consider cause versus effect.\n\nThe small-town setting in Iowa offers many different elements to the melodramatic film. According to Noel Brown’s “The Hollywood Family Film: A History, from Shirley Temple to Harry Potter,” small town narratives emphasize a “cyclical way of life: ritualistic daily routines and conventions which offered a bulwark against the forces of social change” (54). In Footloose, this cyclical way of life can be seen in the Sunday morning church services and the school life. The small-town atmosphere offers characters other things. In an article titled: “Rural America in Film and Literature” by Joyce Dyer, it is stated that, “The country, of course, has  its beauty and  its virtue.  But the danger is mythologizing the country to create simple answers to the complicated problems our  own  lives  present  us  with” (Dyer 57). In this film, the religious leader, Reverend Moore relies on his religion to provide the answers to both his and the community’s deeper troubles.\n\nThe audience later acknowledges that Reverend Moore’s moral ideals mask his internal struggles involving grief over his son, Bobby who died in a freak accident. The strict no-music policy has been enforced on the small town and congregation, as a means of providing the key that will save the youth generation.\n\nThe religious authority rejects all forms of popular entertainment because of its potential impact and influence on the youth. The youth culture is shrouded around secrecy because many of the teenagers feel as though they cannot be honest with their parents. Ariel feels as though her father does not accept her as she is. In one scene, Ariel arrives late from going out. Her dad comes down the stairs and sees her there. He begins to ask her questions about where she has been and with whom. Ariel says: “Why do you rule my life…” She does not find the same kind of solace or benefits in having these rules as her father does. She finds the rural environment stifling.\n\n“The country  has  become  a dangerous  metaphor,  promising  answers where  there are  none.  The myth  of  country  is  soothing  and sweet, but false” (Dyer 57). The country and the small town offers the townspeople an easy solution to the social problem of youthful misconduct. Many of the characters look toward the religious authorities for answers. In one scene, the preacher, Ariel’s father admits his responsibility to the community. His wife tells him that he can’t save everyone. The small-town environment also emphasizes the importance of family and parent-family relationships (Brown). In Footloose, you can see this in Ariel and Ren’s relationships with their families. Ren has a heart-to-heart with his mother about why he wants to have the dance. She begins to understand that her son is not doing this mindlessly; there is a reason.\n\nAriel tells her father how she honestly feels about his sermons and this amount of honesty and openness makes her father reconsider his role in the community.\n\nThe end of the film showcases the progression of moral and cultural polarization. After Ariel tells her father about her concerns, he begins to lessen his stronghold on her and the teenagers. In the scene where the parish is burning the books, Reverend Moore, tells the churchgoers to put out the fire and to keep the books. This scene takes place after the shift. Is the youth culture merely a reflection of the youth generation or has the youth generation been influenced by the popular media? During the 1980s, this social question became an important one to consider. Footloose presents implicit references to the 1980s cultural revolution throughout the film through the examination of religious authority and the small town atmosphere.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Twitter\n- Facebook\n\n*\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nΔ\n\n# Main menu\n\n- Footloose as a Hollywood Musical\n- Melodramatic Themes: Family and Community\n- Music Video or Musical?\n- Research\n- The Blog Format\n- The Teen Audience: Comparisons to Rebel Without a Cause\n- Theme: Religious Authority and the Small Town\n- Use of Music: Comparisons to Dancer in the Dark\n\n# Recent Posts\n\n- (no title)\n- (no title)\n- Introduction and Thesis\n\n# Archives\n\n- December 2012\n- November 2012\n\n# Categories\n\n- Uncategorized\n\n# Meta\n\n- Register\n- Log in\n- Entries feed\n- Comments feed\n- WordPress.com\n\n- Search\n- RSS feed\n- Random\n\nInspired by the work of , ART GOODMAN, and DAVE NAGATA.

The opening sequence of <Name>Footloose</Name> is very important in introducing viewers to the characters, setting and the constraining atmosphere of the small town.</p>\n        <p>In essence, the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film. As many critics declare, the film’s plot requires a great suspension of belief, so it is important that the opening scene effectively communicate the premise and establish the tone.</p>\n        <p>In the iconic opening sequence in <Name>Footloose</Name>, there is moving feet and catchy popular music.</p>\n        <p>The credit sequence in the beginning of the film introduces the viewer to the importance of music in the film. The silence following the scene is prolonged and creates a stark contrast between the lively city culture and the rural small town experience.</p>\n        <p>The camera cuts to the image of a picturesque sky and mountain and farm landscape. The camera cuts to other rural scenes and then to the stern voice of a man preaching about the social problems concerning teenagers and the youth culture today interrupts the extreme quiet. This opening sequence establishes the distinct moral polarization of music and religion.</p>\n        <p>As a character, <Name>Reverend Moore</Name> represents the moral authority of the small community. <Name>Reverend Moore</Name> is known around town as a kind of luminary, the person who will lead the rest of the community to ‘higher ground’ and out of harms way.</p>\n        <p>The scene in which the characters are dancing to “Dancing in the Sheets” ends when <Name>Ariel</Name>’s father, <Name>Reverend Moore</Name> turns off the radio. The stillness of the moment is prolonged. Everyone dancing in the parking lot and the restaurant stop and turn to watch <Name>Ariel</Name> and her father. Everyone notices her father’s disappointment.</p>\n        <p>It is important to acknowledge the shift that occurs partway through the film. In the beginning, there are negative attitudes towards popular music and dance, but towards the end, there is less of a stigma placed on popular music.</p>\n        <p>The small-town setting in Iowa offers many different elements to the melodramatic film. In <Name>Footloose</Name>, this cyclical way of life can be seen in the Sunday morning church services and the school life.</p>\n        <p>The audience later acknowledges that <Name>Reverend Moore</Name>’s moral ideals mask his internal struggles involving grief over his son, Bobby who died in a freak accident. The strict no-music policy has been enforced on the small town and congregation, as a means of providing the key that will save the youth generation.</p>\n        <p>The religious authority rejects all forms of popular entertainment because of its potential impact and influence on the youth. The youth culture is shrouded around secrecy because many of the teenagers feel as though they cannot be honest with their parents.</p>\n        <p>The end of the film showcases the progression of moral and cultural polarization. After <Name>Ariel</Name> tells her father about her concerns, he begins to lessen his stronghold on her and the teenagers.</p>\n        <p>During the 1980s, this social question became an important one to consider. <Name>Footloose</Name> presents implicit references to the 1980s cultural revolution throughout the film through the examination of religious authority and the small town atmosphere.</p>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes.

Considered Lynn's signature song, it was originally released as a single in 1970 and became a number one hit on the Billboard country chart. It was later released on an album of the same name. Produced by Owen Bradley, the song tells the story of Lynn's coal-mining father in rural Kentucky during the Great Depression. Lynn, who was born in 1932 and experienced the Great Depression as a child, also describes her childhood and the circumstances she was raised in during those years.[2]\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" would receive positive reviews from journalists and music critics alike following its release. It would become one of Lynn's signature recordings in her career. It would also be considered one of music's most significant recordings, according to polls from Time and the Recording Industry Association of America. The song has been covered several times since its original release, notably being a collaboration from Lynn, Sheryl Crow and Miranda Lambert.\n\n## Background and composition\n\nThe music and lyrics of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" had been written entirely by Loretta Lynn. She composed the song in 1969, a year before its official recording. While writing the lyrics, Lynn composed the melody at the same time. The melody had originally been written in a bluegrass style, which matched the style of music she was raised singing. According to Lynn, she had trouble rhyming some of the song's words. \"I had to match up words like “holler” and “daughter” and “water.”  But after it was done, the rhymes weren't so important,\" Lynn wrote in her 1976 autobiography.[3][4] Lynn spent several hours writing the remainder of the song. When it was completed, a total of nine verses were composed.[4]\n\nThe song recounts the day-to-day life of her childhood growing up in rural poverty in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky.[5][4] In the lyrics, Lynn describes herself as the daughter of a coal mining father. She recounted how her father also worked as a farmer growing corn. Along with her father, Lynn also wrote about her mother and how she worked tirelessly on household duties such as cleaning and washing.[6] Subsequent verses recall Lynn's other childhood experiences and hardships, such as her mother reading the Bible by a coal-oil light or having bloody fingers from constantly doing the laundry using a wash board.[7]  Decades later, Lynn revealed that the song only hinted at other childhood experiences. \"The song doesn’t tell half of it. If I told the whole story nobody would believe it now anyway.\"[6]\n\n## Recording\n\nLynn recorded the song upon the encouragement of her longtime record producer, Owen Bradley. However, Bradley disliked that Lynn's original written version contained ten verses. Fearing the song would be as long as Marty Robbins' hit \"El Paso,\" Bradley told her: \"There’s already been an ‘El Paso,’ there didn't need to be another one.\"[6] Before recording, she removed extra verses of the song related to further mentions of her father and life in rural Kentucky. Lynn also removed lines related to her mother killing a pig during an annual \"hog-killing day.\"[4] In total, four verses were removed from the original composition. Lynn later recalled removing the verses: \" I cried the whole time. And I have lost those verses, I do not remember them. I wish I did.\"[6] \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was officially recorded on October 1, 1969, at Bradley's own Bradley's Barn recording studio located in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The background vocalists for the session were the Jordanaires.  Also recorded during the same session were the tracks \"Wings Upon Your Horns\" and \"You Wanna Give Me a Lift.\" Both recordings would later be hits for Lynn as well.[8]\n\nOwen Bradley allowed Lynn to record the song using her planned arrangement. The song opened featuring a steel guitar and was followed by a fiddle. She then sang the song to the band and it was cut live in the studio during the session. Additionally, her husband, Doolittle Lynn, suggested the incorporation of a banjo into the song, which was eventually added as well. According to Lynn, only a couple of takes of the song were recorded before compiling them together. \"I never did many takes of anything. The more I sing, the worse I get. I like to make it fresh,\" she reflected.[6] Unlike live performances, the recorded version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" did not include guitar-playing by Lynn herself. Only included was her live vocal. Instead guitarists from The Nashville A-Team were chosen for the record.[8]\n\n## Critical reception\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" has received a positive reception from critics since its original 1970 release. In 1971, Billboard magazine praised the song for retaining \"true country flavor.\"[9] Cary O'Dell of the Library of Congress called it Lynn's \"most autobiographical song\" and commented on its importance to the country music genre. \"It is perhaps one of country music’s most autobiographical songs ever, a major achievement for a genre which often specializes in memoirs set to music, Parton’s 'Coat of Many Colors' being a prime example,\" he wrote.[4] Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann found the song to be a symbol of Lynn's pride in being a working class person. \"She stuck out her chin to defend poor folks culture...Like the lady, herself, Loretta's songs shoot from the hip. Her pride is in her working class background,\" they wrote in 2003.[10]\n\nMusic critics of Rolling Stone also gave \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" a positive response and named it one of Lynn's \"20 Essential Songs.\" \"With astonishing economy, the pride of Butcher Holler details her sparse but happy childhood and the things they did keep shoes on their feet (specifically, sell a hog). She ends the tune in a place of greater means, but undeniably proud of where she’s been,\" they commented.[11] In 2024, the publication ranked the song at #14 on its 200 Greatest Country Songs of All Time ranking.[12]\n\nBilly Dukes of Taste of Country called the tune \"without a doubt one of the most well-known hits of all time.\"[13] Wide Open Country's Bobbie Jean Sawyer ranked it number one on her list of \"The 15 Best Of All Time\" songs by Lynn. \"In just three minutes, the song sums up Lynn's incredible life and the career that made her a country icon,\" Sawyer wrote.[14]\n\n## Release and chart performance\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was released as a single to radio one year after its recording. It was issued to via Decca Records as a seven inch vinyl single on October 5, 1970. Included on the B-side was the track, \"The Man of the House.\"[15] The song became a number one hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart later that year, spending one week at the position. It was Lynn's fourth number one single in her career and one of 16 chart-topping hits.[16] The single also peaked at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first entry on that chart. Over the decade, Lynn would reach the Hot 100 three more times.[17] \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" also charted on the RPM Country Singles chart in Canada, reaching the number one position as well.[18] In 1971, the single was included on Lynn's studio album, also titled Coal Miner's Daughter. The song was the opening track on the album.[1]\n\n## Legacy\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" has not only been considered one of Loretta Lynn's most significant songs, but has also been considered one of music's most significant recordings. In 1998, Loretta's 1970 version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[19] In 2001, the Recording Industry Association of America named it as one of their Songs of the Century.[20][21] The song has also been ranked by other music agencies, including Rolling Stone, who ranked it on their list of the \"100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time\" at No. 42,  and their list of the \"Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" at No. 255.[22][23] Country Music Television ranked the song on a similar list titled the \"100 Greatest Songs of Country Music.\"[24][25] In 2009, \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was added by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry. Cary O'Dell spoke of the song's significance in an essay about the song: \"With this Decca release, Lynn not only delivered an instant classic, she also forever changed her image.  Though already highly successful, up until this time, Lynn was most famous for her tough girl songs, musical warnings to lazy, unappreciative, floundering husbands and the women they cheat with...“Coal Miner’s Daughter” introduced audiences to a new, softer and more reflective Lynn.\"[4]\n\nThe song has also been considered significant by other publications. This included Time magazine, which named it among its \"100 All-Time Songs\". The magazine called it the song to have a \"purely Appalachian\" style that \"makes vivid musical pictures of Daddy’s job at the Van Lear Coal Mines, Mommy’s bleeding fingers at the washboard, the kids barefoot in summer and shod from a mail-order catalog in winter.\"[26] \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" also became the title of Lynn's 2010 tribute album that was recorded by other artists. It was officially named, Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn. Artists featured included The White Stripes, Reba McEntire and Paramore.[27]\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" would also serve as the inspiration and title for future works by Lynn. In 1976, her first autobiography was also titled Coal Miner's Daughter and helped introduce Lynn's music to newer generations. This was followed in 1980 by the biopic of the same name starring Sissy Spacek.[4] The film became a critical and commercial success and received seven nominations at the 53rd Academy Awards including for the Best Picture, with Spacek winning Best Actress portraying Lynn.[5]\n\n## Track listing\n\n7\" vinyl single[15]\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" – 3:00\n- \"The Man of the House\" – 2:48\n\n## Charts\n\n| Chart (1970)                         |   Peak  position  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Canada Country Songs (RPM)[18]       |                1  |\n| US Billboard Hot 100[28]             |               83  |\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)[29] |                1  |\n\n## Cover versions\n\nSeveral versions of \"Coal Miner's Daughters\" have been notably recorded by other artists and entertainers. The song was parodied as Cow Minder's Daughter by Laraine Newman, who portrayed the fictional east Indian singer \"Govinda Lynn.\" The song was performed in a skit on season five of Saturday Night Live.[30] In 1971, RCA Records country singer Norma Jean recorded a version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" for her self-titled studio album.[31] Irish country performer Mary Duff recorded the track for her 2004 studio release, Just a Country Girl.[32] Country artist Stella Parton (sister of Dolly Parton) recorded a cover version of the song for her 2010 studio album, American Coal. The song appeared as the tenth track on the album.[33] Lynn re-recorded several times, notably in 2010 for a tribute album and in 2018 for her studio release called Wouldn't It Be Great.[34]\n\n### Sissy Spacek version\n\nIn 1980, a version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was recorded by American actress and singer Sissy Spacek for Lynn's 1980 biopic of the same name. Spacek portrayed Lynn in the film. Spacek learned to sing like Lynn by following her on tour for a year in the late 1970s. She also tried to imitate Lynn's speech patterns and singing style by visiting Lynn at her house. Together, the pair also performed on the Grand Ole Opry before the film's release. In addition, Spacek studied with Owen Bradley (Lynn's record producer) in order to further develop her character.[36] Spacek recorded her version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" in December 1979. The recording session was produced by Bradley as well and was held at Bradley's Barn, the same studio where Lynn recorded the song ten years prior. Additional songs Spacek performed for the soundtrack were cut during the same session, such as \"You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man),\" \"Fist City\" and \"There He Goes.\"[37]\n\nIn addition to Spacek recording her own version for the film, it was also released as a single. Spacek's version was released following the release of the official soundtrack. It was issued as a single by MCA Records in April 1980 and was issued as a 7\" vinyl record. Included on the B-side was Spacek's version of Lynn's original 1960 hit, \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl.\"[38][16] Spacek's version became a top-40 hit in the United States, reaching number 24 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1980.[16] Her version of the song was reviewed positively by Cub Koda of Allmusic, who also reviewed additional songs on the original soundtrack. \"Sissy Spacek did a more than credible job of singing like Loretta Lynn in the movie, and this soundtrack proves it. From the \"early\" sides to the hits at the end, Spacek sings her heart out and actually varies her singing approach to sound more assured and professional on the \"later\" ones.[35]\n\n#### Track listing\n\n7\" vinyl single\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" – 3:00\n- \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\" – 2:17\n\n#### Weekly charts\n\n| Chart (1980)                         |   Peak  position  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Canada Country Songs (RPM)[39]       |                7  |\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)[40] |               24  |\n\n### Loretta Lynn collaboration\n\nThe song was notably re-recorded by Loretta Lynn in 2010 for an album dedicated to her entitled, Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn. The new version featured vocals from singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow and country artist Miranda Lambert. Lynn spoke of the re-recording in 2010 and praised the collaboration with Crow and Lambert: \"I love Miranda and Sheryl, and I really felt they both brought something different singing style wise to this song.\"[42] Although other producers helped with the tribute album, only John Carter Cash and Patsy Lynn (Lynn's daughter) served as producer's on \"Coal Miner's Daughter.\" Also featured in the song's personnel was Lynn's writing collaborator, Shawn Camp and Lynn's former producer, Randy Scruggs. The track was recorded at Cash's Cabin Studio in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Crow and Lambert both added their vocals in later studio sessions.[43]\n\nLynn's re-recording was given positive reviews. Holly Gleason of Lonestar Music Magazine praised Lynn's traditional approach when recording the song with Crow and Lambert. \"Lynn can still show the kids how to do it: tossing her head back and going to the song’s center, demonstrating what a fiery, feisty country presence is,\" Gleason commented.[44] Music and Musician's commented that the version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was a collaboration with \"younger admirers.\"[45] Aryl Watson of Cover Me Songs stated that \"Lambert and Crow willingly take a backseat on the chorus, letting Lynn tell the story her way.\"[46]\n\nThe re-recording was issued as a single via Columbia Records on October 4, 2010. It was released as a digital download via iTunes and other downloading sites upon its original release.[42] The single was released both to country radio stations and to college radio. According to Gary Overton of Sony Music Entertainment, Lynn called radio stations herself to help promote the song. When asked about the decision, Lynn replied, \"\"Well, why not?\".[47] The single entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for one week on December 4, 2010, and peaked at number 55 on the survey. It was Lynn's first charting single since 2000's \"Country in My Genes.\"[48]\n\nA music video was also filmed for the new single release. The video featured Crow and Lambert, along with Lynn at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.[47] The music video was directed by Deaton-Flanigen.[49] In November 2010, the trio performed \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" at the Country Music Association Awards ceremony.[50]\n\n#### Track listing\n\nMusic download[42]\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" – 3:11\n\n#### Weekly charts\n\n| Chart (2010)                         |   Peak  position  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)[29] |               55  |\n\n### Loretta Lynn recitation\n\nLoretta Lynn notably re-recorded \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" again for her 2021 studio album, Still Woman Enough. The song and album were announced on the fiftieth anniversary of Lynn's 1970 studio album.[52] The new version was recorded as a spoken word recitation. Although Lynn had previously cut the song in several styles, \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" had not been performed through speaking only. The song was recorded with minimal instrumentation at the Cash Cabin Recording Studio. The sessions were produced by John Carter Cash (Johnny Cash's son) and Patsy Lynn Russell (Lynn's daughter).[53]\n\nThe recitation version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was released as the lead single off Still Woman Enough in January 2021.[54] The album is scheduled for official release on March 19, 2021, through Legacy Recordings. It will mark Lynn's first studio album since 2018's Wouldn't It Be Great.[53][52] Lab.fm praised the recitation version of the song, calling it \"a warm, poignant recitation of her signature lyrics.\"[55] Lorie Hollabaugh of Music Row magazine called the recitation \"emotional\" in her announcement of her 2021 album.[56]\n\nA music video for \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was directed by David McClister on site at Lynn's ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. The video was released the same day as the recitation single.[53] The video also included footage taken from the replica of Lynn's childhood cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. Lynn reflected on the song and the video in a press statement: \"It’s amazing how much has happened in the fifty years since ‘Coal Miner’s Daughter’ first came out and I'm extremely grateful to be given a part to play in the history of American music.\"[57]\n\n#### Track listing\n\nMusic download[54]\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter (Recitation)\" – 2:07\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b Owens, Thom. \"Coal Miner's Daughter: Loretta Lynn: Songs, Reviews, Credits\".

Considered Lynn's signature song, it was originally released as a single in <ReleaseYear>1970</ReleaseYear> and became a number one hit on the Billboard country chart. It was later released on an album of the same name. Produced by <Director>Owen Bradley</Director>, the song tells the story of Lynn's coal-mining father in rural Kentucky during the Great Depression. Lynn, who was born in 1932 and experienced the Great Depression as a child, also describes her childhood and the circumstances she was raised in during those years.\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" would receive positive reviews from journalists and music critics alike following its release. It would become one of Lynn's signature recordings in her career. It would also be considered one of music's most significant recordings, according to polls from Time and the Recording Industry Association of America. The song has been covered several times since its original release, notably being a collaboration from Lynn, <Name>Sheryl Crow</Name> and <Name>Miranda Lambert</Name>.\n\n## Background and composition\n\nThe music and lyrics of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" had been written entirely by <Name>Loretta Lynn</Name>. She composed the song in 1969, a year before its official recording. While writing the lyrics, Lynn composed the melody at the same time. The melody had originally been written in a bluegrass style, which matched the style of music she was raised singing. According to Lynn, she had trouble rhyming some of the song's words. \"I had to match up words like “holler” and “daughter” and “water.” But after it was done, the rhymes weren't so important,\" Lynn wrote in her 1976 autobiography. Lynn spent several hours writing the remainder of the song. When it was completed, a total of nine verses were composed.\n\nThe song recounts the day-to-day life of her childhood growing up in rural poverty in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. In the lyrics, Lynn describes herself as the daughter of a coal mining father. She recounted how her father also worked as a farmer growing corn. Along with her father, Lynn also wrote about her mother and how she worked tirelessly on household duties such as cleaning and washing. Subsequent verses recall Lynn's other childhood experiences and hardships, such as her mother reading the Bible by a coal-oil light or having bloody fingers from constantly doing the laundry using a washboard. Decades later, Lynn revealed that the song only hinted at other childhood experiences. \"The song doesn’t tell half of it. If I told the whole story nobody would believe it now anyway.\"\n\n## Recording\n\nLynn recorded the song upon the encouragement of her longtime record producer, <Director>Owen Bradley</Director>. However, Bradley disliked that Lynn's original written version contained ten verses. Fearing the song would be as long as Marty Robbins' hit \"El Paso,\" Bradley told her: \"There’s already been an ‘El Paso,’ there didn't need to be another one.\" Before recording, she removed extra verses of the song related to further mentions of her father and life in rural Kentucky. Lynn also removed lines related to her mother killing a pig during an annual \"hog-killing day.\" In total, four verses were removed from the original composition. Lynn later recalled removing the verses: \"I cried the whole time. And I have lost those verses, I do not remember them. I wish I did.\" \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was officially recorded on October 1, 1969, at Bradley's own Bradley's Barn recording studio located in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The background vocalists for the session were the Jordanaires. Also recorded during the same session were the tracks \"Wings Upon Your Horns\" and \"You Wanna Give Me a Lift.\" Both recordings would later be hits for Lynn as well.\n\nOwen Bradley allowed Lynn to record the song using her planned arrangement. The song opened featuring a steel guitar and was followed by a fiddle. She then sang the song to the band and it was cut live in the studio during the session. Additionally, her husband, Doolittle Lynn, suggested the incorporation of a banjo into the song, which was eventually added as well. According to Lynn, only a couple of takes of the song were recorded before compiling them together. \"I never did many takes of anything. The more I sing, the worse I get. I like to make it fresh,\" she reflected. Unlike live performances, the recorded version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" did not include guitar-playing by Lynn herself. Only included was her live vocal. Instead, guitarists from The Nashville A-Team were chosen for the record.\n\n## Critical reception\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" has received a positive reception from critics since its original 1970 release. In 1971, Billboard magazine praised the song for retaining \"true country flavor.\" Cary O'Dell of the Library of Congress called it Lynn's \"most autobiographical song\" and commented on its importance to the country music genre. \"It is perhaps one of country music’s most autobiographical songs ever, a major achievement for a genre which often specializes in memoirs set to music, Parton’s 'Coat of Many Colors' being a prime example,\" he wrote. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann found the song to be a symbol of Lynn's pride in being a working class person. \"She stuck out her chin to defend poor folks culture...Like the lady, herself, Loretta's songs shoot from the hip. Her pride is in her working class background,\" they wrote in 2003.\n\nMusic critics of Rolling Stone also gave \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" a positive response and named it one of Lynn's \"20 Essential Songs.\" \"With astonishing economy, the pride of Butcher Holler details her sparse but happy childhood and the things they did keep shoes on their feet (specifically, sell a hog). She ends the tune in a place of greater means, but undeniably proud of where she’s been,\" they commented. In 2024, the publication ranked the song at #14 on its 200 Greatest Country Songs of All Time ranking.\n\nBilly Dukes of Taste of Country called the tune \"without a doubt one of the most well-known hits of all time.\" Wide Open Country's Bobbie Jean Sawyer ranked it number one on her list of \"The 15 Best Of All Time\" songs by Lynn. \"In just three minutes, the song sums up Lynn's incredible life and the career that made her a country icon,\" Sawyer wrote.\n\n## Release and chart performance\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was released as a single to radio one year after its recording. It was issued via Decca Records as a seven-inch vinyl single on October 5, 1970. Included on the B-side was the track, \"The Man of the House.\" The song became a number one hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart later that year, spending one week at the position. It was Lynn's fourth number one single in her career and one of 16 chart-topping hits. The single also peaked at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her first entry on that chart. Over the decade, Lynn would reach the Hot 100 three more times. \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" also charted on the RPM Country Singles chart in Canada, reaching the number one position as well. In 1971, the single was included on Lynn's studio album, also titled Coal Miner's Daughter. The song was the opening track on the album.\n\n## Legacy\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" has not only been considered one of Loretta Lynn's most significant songs, but has also been considered one of music's most significant recordings. In 1998, Loretta's 1970 version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2001, the Recording Industry Association of America named it as one of their Songs of the Century. The song has also been ranked by other music agencies, including Rolling Stone, who ranked it on their list of the \"100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time\" at No. 42, and their list of the \"Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" at No. 255. Country Music Television ranked the song on a similar list titled the \"100 Greatest Songs of Country Music.\" In 2009, \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was added by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry. Cary O'Dell spoke of the song's significance in an essay about the song: \"With this Decca release, Lynn not only delivered an instant classic, she also forever changed her image. Though already highly successful, up until this time, Lynn was most famous for her tough girl songs, musical warnings to lazy, unappreciative, floundering husbands and the women they cheat with...“Coal Miner’s Daughter” introduced audiences to a new, softer and more reflective Lynn.\"\n\nThe song has also been considered significant by other publications. This included Time magazine, which named it among its \"100 All-Time Songs\". The magazine called it the song to have a \"purely Appalachian\" style that \"makes vivid musical pictures of Daddy’s job at the Van Lear Coal Mines, Mommy’s bleeding fingers at the washboard, the kids barefoot in summer and shod from a mail-order catalog in winter.\" \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" also became the title of Lynn's 2010 tribute album that was recorded by other artists. It was officially named, Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn. Artists featured included The White Stripes, Reba McEntire, and Paramore.\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" would also serve as the inspiration and title for future works by Lynn. In 1976, her first autobiography was also titled Coal Miner's Daughter and helped introduce Lynn's music to newer generations. This was followed in 1980 by the biopic of the same name starring <Name>Sissy Spacek</Name>. The film became a critical and commercial success and received seven nominations at the 53rd Academy Awards including for the Best Picture, with Spacek winning Best Actress portraying Lynn.\n\n## Track listing\n\n7\" vinyl single\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" – 3:00\n- \"The Man of the House\" – 2:48\n\n## Charts\n\n| Chart (1970)                         |   Peak  position  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Canada Country Songs (RPM)          |                1  |\n| US Billboard Hot 100                |               83  |\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)    |                1  |\n\n## Cover versions\n\nSeveral versions of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" have been notably recorded by other artists and entertainers. The song was parodied as Cow Minder's Daughter by Laraine Newman, who portrayed the fictional east Indian singer \"Govinda Lynn.\" The song was performed in a skit on season five of Saturday Night Live. In 1971, RCA Records country singer Norma Jean recorded a version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" for her self-titled studio album. Irish country performer Mary Duff recorded the track for her 2004 studio release, Just a Country Girl. Country artist Stella Parton (sister of Dolly Parton) recorded a cover version of the song for her 2010 studio album, American Coal. The song appeared as the tenth track on the album. Lynn re-recorded several times, notably in 2010 for a tribute album and in 2018 for her studio release called Wouldn't It Be Great.\n\n### Sissy Spacek version\n\nIn 1980, a version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was recorded by American actress and singer <Name>Sissy Spacek</Name> for Lynn's 1980 biopic of the same name. Spacek portrayed Lynn in the film. Spacek learned to sing like Lynn by following her on tour for a year in the late 1970s. She also tried to imitate Lynn's speech patterns and singing style by visiting Lynn at her house. Together, the pair also performed on the Grand Ole Opry before the film's release. In addition, Spacek studied with <Director>Owen Bradley</Director> (Lynn's record producer) in order to further develop her character. Spacek recorded her version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" in December 1979. The recording session was produced by Bradley as well and was held at Bradley's Barn, the same studio where Lynn recorded the song ten years prior. Additional songs Spacek performed for the soundtrack were cut during the same session, such as \"You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man),\" \"Fist City,\" and \"There He Goes.\"\n\nIn addition to Spacek recording her own version for the film, it was also released as a single. Spacek's version was released following the release of the official soundtrack. It was issued as a single by MCA Records in April 1980 and was issued as a 7\" vinyl record. Included on the B-side was Spacek's version of Lynn's original 1960 hit, \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl.\" Spacek's version became a top-40 hit in the United States, reaching number 24 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in 1980. Her version of the song was reviewed positively by Cub Koda of Allmusic, who also reviewed additional songs on the original soundtrack. \"Sissy Spacek did a more than credible job of singing like Loretta Lynn in the movie, and this soundtrack proves it. From the \"early\" sides to the hits at the end, Spacek sings her heart out and actually varies her singing approach to sound more assured and professional on the \"later\" ones.\n\n#### Track listing\n\n7\" vinyl single\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" – 3:00\n- \"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl\" – 2:17\n\n#### Weekly charts\n\n| Chart (1980)                         |   Peak  position  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Canada Country Songs (RPM)          |                7  |\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)    |               24  |\n\n### Loretta Lynn collaboration\n\nThe song was notably re-recorded by <Name>Loretta Lynn</Name> in 2010 for an album dedicated to her entitled, Coal Miner's Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn. The new version featured vocals from singer-songwriter <Name>Sheryl Crow</Name> and country artist <Name>Miranda Lambert</Name>. Lynn spoke of the re-recording in 2010 and praised the collaboration with Crow and Lambert: \"I love Miranda and Sheryl, and I really felt they both brought something different singing style wise to this song.\" Although other producers helped with the tribute album, only John Carter Cash and Patsy Lynn (Lynn's daughter) served as producers on \"Coal Miner's Daughter.\" Also featured in the song's personnel was Lynn's writing collaborator, Shawn Camp and Lynn's former producer, Randy Scruggs. The track was recorded at Cash's Cabin Studio in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Crow and Lambert both added their vocals in later studio sessions.\n\nLynn's re-recording was given positive reviews. Holly Gleason of Lonestar Music Magazine praised Lynn's traditional approach when recording the song with Crow and Lambert. \"Lynn can still show the kids how to do it: tossing her head back and going to the song’s center, demonstrating what a fiery, feisty country presence is,\" Gleason commented. Music and Musicians commented that the version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was a collaboration with \"younger admirers.\" Aryl Watson of Cover Me Songs stated that \"Lambert and Crow willingly take a backseat on the chorus, letting Lynn tell the story her way.\"\n\nThe re-recording was issued as a single via Columbia Records on October 4, 2010. It was released as a digital download via iTunes and other downloading sites upon its original release. The single was released both to country radio stations and to college radio. According to Gary Overton of Sony Music Entertainment, Lynn called radio stations herself to help promote the song. When asked about the decision, Lynn replied, \"Well, why not?\". The single entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for one week on December 4, 2010, and peaked at number 55 on the survey. It was Lynn's first charting single since 2000's \"Country in My Genes.\"\n\nA music video was also filmed for the new single release. The video featured Crow and Lambert, along with Lynn at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. The music video was directed by Deaton-Flanigen. In November 2010, the trio performed \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" at the Country Music Association Awards ceremony.\n\n#### Track listing\n\nMusic download\n\n- \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" – 3:11\n\n#### Weekly charts\n\n| Chart (2010)                         |   Peak  position  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)    |               55  |\n\n### Loretta Lynn recitation\n\nLoretta Lynn notably re-recorded \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" again for her 2021 studio album, Still Woman Enough. The song and album were announced on the fiftieth anniversary of Lynn's 1970 studio album. The new version was recorded as a spoken word recitation. Although Lynn had previously cut the song in several styles, \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" had not been performed through speaking only. The song was recorded with minimal instrumentation at the Cash Cabin Recording Studio. The sessions were produced by John Carter Cash (Johnny Cash's son) and Patsy Lynn Russell (Lynn's daughter).\n\nThe recitation version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was released as the lead single off Still Woman Enough in January 2021. The album is scheduled for official release on March 19, 2021, through Legacy Recordings. It will mark Lynn's first studio album since 2018's Wouldn't It Be Great. Lab.fm praised the recitation version of the song, calling it \"a warm, poignant recitation of her signature lyrics.\" Lorie Hollabaugh of Music Row magazine called the recitation \"emotional\" in her announcement of her 2021 album.\n\nA music video for \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was directed by David McClister on site at Lynn's ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee. The video was released the same day as the recitation single. The video also included footage taken from the replica of Lynn's childhood cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. Lynn reflected on the song and the video in a press statement: \"It’s amazing how much has happened in the fifty years since ‘Coal Miner’s Daughter’ first came out and I'm extremely grateful to be given a part to play in the history of American music.\"\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the key attributes of the song \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" while maintaining the original meaning and context.

Brooks. The film concerns a virtuoso television news producer (Holly Hunter) who has daily emotional breakdowns, a brilliant yet prickly reporter (Albert Brooks), and the latter's charismatic but far less seasoned rival (William Hurt). It also stars Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Jack Nicholson.\n\nThe film was acclaimed by critics and at the 60th Academy Awards received seven nominations, including Best Picture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\".[2][3][4]\n\n## Plot\n\nJane Craig is a talented, intense news producer who is passionate about reporting and abhors the trend towards soft news in broadcasts. Her best friend and collaborator, Aaron Altman, is a gifted writer and reporter lacking in social skills. The two work in the Washington, D.C. bureau of a national TV network. The bureau hires Tom Grunick, a local news anchor who is handsome, likable, and telegenic but lacks news experience and isn't especially bright.\n\nAaron and Jane go to Nicaragua to report on the Sandinista rebels and get caught up in a shooting battle between them and the contras, bringing home footage that wins the approval of their national anchor. At an office party, news arrives of a Libyan plane having bombed a U.S. military base in Italy. The network chief decides to air a special report, with Tom as anchor and Jane as executive producer. Aaron is devastated at Tom's selection. Watching from his home, he calls Jane with pertinent information, which she feeds to Tom through his earpiece. With the combination of Tom's on-camera poise and Jane's hard-news skills, the report is a great success. Their teamwork also intensifies their mutual attraction.\n\nWanting to complete a story without outside assistance, Tom creates a piece on date rape that includes an interview with a rape victim, where Tom is shown tearing up in reaction. In the face of potential layoffs, Aaron receives an opportunity to anchor the weekend news due to most of his colleagues going to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. He seeks advice from Tom, who encourages Aaron to be more salesman-like in his approach. Aaron takes Tom's advice but during the broadcast begins sweating uncontrollably, resulting in a disastrous broadcast. Meanwhile, Jane and Tom progress romantically at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  But before things get more involved, Jane leaves to console Aaron. The two have a heated argument, where Aaron tells Jane that Tom represents everything she hates about the direction of news media. He also tells Jane that he is in love with her.\n\nThe layoffs hit the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs. Tom is moved to the London office, indicating that he is being groomed for a national anchor position; Jane is promoted to bureau chief. Tom and Jane agree to take a romantic getaway together before starting their new jobs. Aaron tells Jane he plans to take a job at a television station in Portland, Oregon. Before he leaves, he tells Jane that Tom's tears during his date-rape piece were staged; reviewing the footage, Jane realizes that he is correct. She angrily confronts Tom at the airport, saying that his actions were a breach of journalistic ethics and that she cannot in good conscience become involved with him. Tom argues with her but relents, leaving Jane behind.\n\nThe three meet again seven years later. Tom has taken over as national anchor, Aaron has a wife and child, and Jane has a new boyfriend. Jane plans to take a managing editor role for the network in New York, working with Tom again. Tom leaves after Jane declines a dinner invitation with him and his fiancée, while she and Aaron catch up on their respective lives.\n\n## Cast\n\n- William Hurt as Tom Grunick\n    - Kimber Shoop as young Tom\n- Albert Brooks as Aaron Altman\n    - Dwayne Markee as young Aaron\n- Holly Hunter as Jane Craig\n    - Gennie James as young Jane\n- Robert Prosky as Ernie Merriman\n- Lois Chiles as Jennifer Mack\n- Joan Cusack as Blair Litton\n- Peter Hackes as Paul Moore\n- Christian Clemenson as Bobby\n- Jack Nicholson as Bill Rorish\n- Leo Burmester as Mr. Craig\n- Marita Geraghty as Date-Rape Woman\n- Glen Roven as News Theme Writer\n- Marc Shaiman as News Theme Writer\n- John Cusack as Angry Messenger\n\n## Production\n\nThe score was by Bill Conti.

She served as associate producer and technical advisor for the film.[5] The female lead was originally written for Debra Winger, who worked with James L. Brooks in Terms of Endearment. However, Winger became pregnant and was replaced by Holly Hunter just two days before filming began. Sigourney Weaver, Dianne Wiest, Jessica Lange, Elizabeth Perkins, and Mary Beth Hurt were also considered for the role.[6] Brooks originally wrote the role of Aaron Altman specifically for his longtime friend Albert Brooks in mind. Principal photography began in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 1987, officially wrapping in April 1987 after filming several scenes in Florida.[7]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nBroadcast News was given a limited release  on December 16, 1987, in seven theaters and managed to gross USD $197,542 on its opening weekend.[8] It went into wide release in the United States on December 25, 1987, in 677 theaters, grossing $5.5 million on its opening weekend. The film went on to make $51.3 million in North America and $16.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $67.3 million.[9]\n\n### Critical response\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Broadcast News four out of four stars and praised the film for being as \"knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves\".[10] In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \"As the fast-talking Aaron, Albert Brooks comes very close to stealing Broadcast News. Mr. Brooks ... is more or less the conscience of Broadcast News\".[11] Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, praised Holly Hunter's performance as \"something of a revelation: her short, feisty, socially gauche, aggressive-compulsive character may be the most intricately layered portrait of a career woman that contemporary Hollywood has given us\".[12]\n\nHal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \"[James] Brooks is excellent at taking us inside the world of television, but not terribly good at analyzing it. He has a facile, too-pat approach to dealing with issues; there's still too much of the sitcom mentality at work\".[13] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss praised William Hurt's performance: \"Hurt is neat too, never standing safely outside his character, always allowing Tom to find the humor in his too-rapid success, locating a dimness behind his eyes when Tom is asked a tough question -- and for Tom, poor soulless sensation-to-be, all questions are tough ones\".[14] The magazine also ranked Broadcast News as one of the best films of the year.[15] The film garnered a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 52 critics. The site's consensus states: \"Blockbuster dramatist James L. Brooks delivers with Broadcast News, fully entertaining with deft, deep characterization.\"[16] The film has an 84% average score at Metacritic, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[17]\n\nBroadcast News was placed on 61 \"ten-best\" lists, making it the most acclaimed film of 1987.[18]\n\n## Accolades\n\n| Award                                           | Category                                                  | Nominee(s)                              | Result    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards[19]                              | Best Picture                                              | James L.

Her best friend and collaborator, Aaron Altman, is a gifted writer and reporter lacking in social skills. The two work in the Washington, D.C. bureau of a national TV network. The bureau hires Tom Grunick, a local news anchor who is handsome, likable, and telegenic but lacks news experience and isn't especially bright.\n        \n        Aaron and Jane go to Nicaragua to report on the Sandinista rebels and get caught up in a shooting battle between them and the contras, bringing home footage that wins the approval of their national anchor. At an office party, news arrives of a Libyan plane having bombed a U.S. military base in Italy. The network chief decides to air a special report, with Tom as anchor and Jane as executive producer. Aaron is devastated at Tom's selection. Watching from his home, he calls Jane with pertinent information, which she feeds to Tom through his earpiece. With the combination of Tom's on-camera poise and Jane's hard-news skills, the report is a great success. Their teamwork also intensifies their mutual attraction.\n        \n        Wanting to complete a story without outside assistance, Tom creates a piece on date rape that includes an interview with a rape victim, where Tom is shown tearing up in reaction. In the face of potential layoffs, Aaron receives an opportunity to anchor the weekend news due to most of his colleagues going to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. He seeks advice from Tom, who encourages Aaron to be more salesman-like in his approach. Aaron takes Tom's advice but during the broadcast begins sweating uncontrollably, resulting in a disastrous broadcast. Meanwhile, Jane and Tom progress romantically at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. But before things get more involved, Jane leaves to console Aaron. The two have a heated argument, where Aaron tells Jane that Tom represents everything she hates about the direction of news media. He also tells Jane that he is in love with her.\n        \n        The layoffs hit the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs. Tom is moved to the London office, indicating that he is being groomed for a national anchor position; Jane is promoted to bureau chief. Tom and Jane agree to take a romantic getaway together before starting their new jobs. Aaron tells Jane he plans to take a job at a television station in Portland, Oregon. Before he leaves, he tells Jane that Tom's tears during his date-rape piece were staged; reviewing the footage, Jane realizes that he is correct. She angrily confronts Tom at the airport, saying that his actions were a breach of journalistic ethics and that she cannot in good conscience become involved with him. Tom argues with her but relents, leaving Jane behind.\n        \n        The three meet again seven years later. Tom has taken over as national anchor, Aaron has a wife and child, and Jane has a new boyfriend. Jane plans to take a managing editor role for the network in New York, working with Tom again. Tom leaves after Jane declines a dinner invitation with him and his fiancée, while she and Aaron catch up on their respective lives.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>William Hurt as Tom Grunick</Actor>\n        <Actor>Albert Brooks as Aaron Altman</Actor>\n        <Actor>Holly Hunter as Jane Craig</Actor>\n        <Actor>Robert Prosky as Ernie Merriman</Actor>\n        <Actor>Lois Chiles as Jennifer Mack</Actor>\n        <Actor>Joan Cusack as Blair Litton</Actor>\n        <Actor>Jack Nicholson as Bill Rorish</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    \n    <Production>\n        The score was by Bill Conti. Emmy Award-winning composers Glen Roven and Marc Shaiman make cameo appearances as a dorky musician team who have composed a theme for the news program in the film. The character of Jane Craig was based on journalist and news producer Susan Zirinsky. She served as associate producer and technical advisor for the film. The female lead was originally written for Debra Winger, who worked with James L. Brooks in Terms of Endearment. However, Winger became pregnant and was replaced by Holly Hunter just two days before filming began. Principal photography began in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 1987, officially wrapping in April 1987 after filming several scenes in Florida.\n    </Production>\n    \n    <Reception>\n        <BoxOffice>\n            Broadcast News was given a limited release on December 16, 1987, in seven theaters and managed to gross USD $197,542 on its opening weekend. It went into wide release in the United States on December 25, 1987, in 677 theaters, grossing $5.5 million on its opening weekend. The film went on to make $51.3 million in North America and $16.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $67.3 million.\n        </BoxOffice>\n        <CriticalResponse>\n            Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Broadcast News four out of four stars and praised the film for being as \"knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves\". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \"As the fast-talking Aaron, Albert Brooks comes very close to stealing Broadcast News. Mr. Brooks ... is more or less the conscience of Broadcast News\". Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, praised Holly Hunter's performance as \"something of a revelation: her short, feisty, socially gauche, aggressive-compulsive character may be the most intricately layered portrait of a career woman that contemporary Hollywood has given us\".\n        </CriticalResponse>\n    </Reception>\n    \n    <Accolades>\n        Broadcast News received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor for William Hurt, and Best Actress for Holly Hunter. It was also recognized by the American Film Institute and was inducted into the National Film Registry for its cultural significance.\n    </Accolades>\n</BroadcastNews>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly structuring it with the specified XML tags, making it more readable and organized for users seeking information about the film \"Broadcast News.\"",

The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The music score was composed by Basil Poledouris, and the cinematography was by Néstor Almendros.\n\nThe film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. But without either the guidance or the restrictions of society, emotional and physical changes arise as they reach puberty, go skinny dipping in the ocean, fall in love, and end up having a child.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon was theatrically released on June 20, 1980, by Columbia Pictures. The film was panned by critics, who disparaged its screenplay, execution, and Shields' performance, but Almendros' cinematography received praise. In spite of the criticism, the film was a commercial success, grossing $58.8 million on a $4.5 million budget and becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1980 in North America. The film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Almendros, and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor for Atkins. Shields won the inaugural Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her work in the film.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the late Victorian period, two cousins, nine-year-old Richard and seven-year-old Emmeline Lestrange, and galley cook Paddy Button, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island in the South Pacific. Paddy cares for the children and forbids them \"by law\" from going to the other side of the island, where he finds an altar with bloody remains from human sacrifices. He also warns them against eating any deadly scarlet berries. He dies after a drunken binge, and the children rebuild their home on a different part of the island.\n\nHaving reached puberty, the two go skinny dipping in the ocean, but Emmeline is uncomfortable with her sexual attraction to Richard and declines to share her \"funny\" thoughts with him. She is frightened by her first menstrual period and refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound.\n\nEventually, Richard recognizes his attraction to Emmeline. She ventures to the forbidden side of the island and sees the altar. Associating the blood with Christ's crucifixion, she concludes that the altar is God and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at the idea of breaking the law and they argue. When Richard tries to initiate sexual contact with Emmeline, she rebuffs him. He hides from her and masturbates.\n\nWhen a ship appears for the first time in years, Emmeline does not light the signal fire and the ship passes by without noticing them. When Richard confronts Emmeline about her failure, she asserts to his angry disbelief that the island is now their home and that they should remain there. Emmeline also reveals that she knows about Richard's masturbation and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about this. They fight and she throws a coconut at him, hitting him in the head by chance. Richard angrily slaps her and kicks her out of their shelter.\n\nEmmeline steps on a venomous stonefish. Weak from the poison, she pleads with Richard to \"take [her] to God\". Richard carries her across the island and places her on the altar. Emmeline recovers and they swim naked in the lagoon. Noticing their bodies' reactions, they discover sexual intercourse and become lovers. Neither recognizes what is happening when Emmeline becomes pregnant, and they are stunned to feel the baby move inside her abdomen, assuming her stomach is causing the movements.\n\nMonths later, Richard observes indigenous people performing a human sacrifice in front of the statue. He becomes frightened and runs away to find Emmeline, whom he finds in labor. Emmeline gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy.\n\nA ship led by Richard's father, Arthur, approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. Content with their lives, Richard and Emmeline walk away instead of signaling for help. Arthur assumes the mud-covered couple are not Richard and Emmeline.\n\nVisiting their original homesite, Richard searches for bananas while Paddy, unnoticed, brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat with Emmeline. Paddy tosses an oar out of the boat as it drifts from the shore. Richard swims after them followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. The boat drifts oarless out to sea.\n\nAfter drifting for days, Richard and Emmeline wake up to find Paddy eating the scarlet berries. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, and lie down to await death. Some hours later, Arthur's ship finds them. Arthur asks, \"Are they dead?\" The officer assures him, \"No, sir. They're asleep.\"\n\n## Cast\n\n- Brooke Shields as Emmeline Lestrange\n    - Elva Josephson as Young Emmeline\n- Christopher Atkins as Richard Lestrange\n    - Glenn Kohan as Young Richard\n- Bradley Pryce as Little Paddy Lestrange\n    - Chad Timmermans as Infant Paddy\n- Leo McKern as Paddy Button\n- William Daniels as Arthur Lestrange\n- Alan Hopgood as Captain\n- Gus Mercurio as Officer\n\n## Production\n\nThe Fiji crested iguana was documented by scientists with the help of The Blue Lagoon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film was a passion project of Randal Kleiser, who had long admired the original novel. He hired Douglas Day Stewart, who had written The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976), to write the script and met up with Richard Franklin, the Australian director, who was looking for work in Hollywood. This gave him the idea to use an Australian crew, which Franklin helped supervise.[1]\n\n### Casting\n\nBrooke Shields was cast as Emmeline Lestrange based on her performance in Pretty Baby (1978). Jodie Foster auditioned for the role of Emmeline Lestrange, but she was turned down. Kelly Preston also auditioned for the role.[2] Diane Lane was offered the role but turned it down.[3] Willie Aames was considered for the role of Richard Lestrange.[2]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography of this film began on June 18, 1979 and it was shot at Nanuya Levu, a privately owned island in Fiji.[4][5] The flora and fauna featured in the film includes an array of animals from multiple continents, including a species of iguana then unknown to Nanuya Levu. Herpetologist John Gibbons had just discovered said iguana on nearby Yadua Tabu, but word from an associate who had watched the film and spotted a strange lizard confirmed the existence of a second population. With credit to The Blue Lagoon, Gibbons described the Fiji crested iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis) in 1981.[6][7]\n\nEye of the Wind, the ship that sailed in the ocean during the movie The Blue Lagoon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShields was 14 years of age when she appeared in the film.[8] All of her nude scenes were performed by the film's 32-year-old stunt coordinator, Kathy Troutt.[9] Shields did many of her topless scenes with her hair glued to her breasts.[10][11] Atkins was 18 when the movie was filmed, and he performed his own nude scenes (which included brief frontal nudity).[4][12][13]\n\nUnderwater moving picture photography was performed by Ron Taylor and Valerie Taylor.[14]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n| The Blue Lagoon (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)   | The Blue Lagoon (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Film score by Basil Poledouris                         | Film score by Basil Poledouris                         |\n| Released                                               | 1980                                                   |\n| Genre                                                  | Soundtrack                                             |\n| Length                                                 | 33:52                                                  |\n\n| No.           | Title                           | Length   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|----------|\n| 1.            | \"Love Theme (Emmeline)\"         | 2:31     |\n| 2.            | \"Main Title\"                    | 2:35     |\n| 3.            | \"Fire\"                          | 1:17     |\n| 4.            | \"The Island\"                    | 1:43     |\n| 5.            | \"The Sands of Time\"             | 2:24     |\n| 6.            | \"Paddy's Death\"                 | 1:18     |\n| 7.            | \"The Children Grow\"             | 4:09     |\n| 8.            | \"Lord of the Lagoon\"            | 1:04     |\n| 9.            | \"Love Theme (Reprise)\"          | 1:10     |\n| 10.           | \"Underwater Courtship\"          | 1:58     |\n| 11.           | \"The Kiss\"                      | 2:33     |\n| 12.           | \"Richard sees Paddy\"            | 2:20     |\n| 13.           | \"The Birth\"                     | 1:13     |\n| 14.           | \"Bad People, Baby Swim\"         | 2:59     |\n| 15.           | \"The Memories\"                  | 1:18     |\n| 16.           | \"3 Points to Port, End Credits\" | 3:20     |\n| Total length: | Total length:                   | 33:52    |\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 12% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A piece of lovely dreck, The Blue Lagoon is a naughty fantasy that's also too chaste to be truly entertaining\".[15] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[16]\n\nAmong the more common criticisms were the ludicrously idyllic portrayal of how children would develop outside of civilized society,[9][17][18][19] the unfulfilled buildup of the island's natives as a climactic threat[9][17][20][21] and how the film, while teasing a prurient appeal, conspicuously obscures all sexual activities.[17][18][22] Roger Ebert gave the film 1½ stars out of 4, claiming that it \"could conceivably have been made interesting, if any serious attempt had been made to explore what might really happen if two 7-year-old kids were shipwrecked on an island. But this isn't a realistic movie. It's a wildly idealized romance, in which the kids live in a hut that looks like a Club Med honeymoon cottage, while restless natives commit human sacrifice on the other side of the island\". He also deemed the ending a blatant cop-out.[17] He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their \"dogs of the year\" in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews.[23] Time Out commented that the film \"was hyped as being about 'natural love'; but apart from 'doing it in the open air', there is nothing natural about two kids (unfettered by the bonds of society from their early years) subscribing to marriage and traditional role-playing\".[18]\n\nJudith Martin of The Washington Post said, \"For some 40 minutes, it's a charming and beautiful film\", but criticized the script when the children mature into teens, particularly \"the dialogue, with its silly double entendres, insisting on a relentlessly filthy chuckle to accompany the children's discovery of each other.\"[19] Gary Arnold, also of The Washington Post, similarly called the film \"a picturesque rhapsody to Learning Skills, Playing House, Going Swimming, Enjoying the Scenery and Starting to Feel Sexy in tropical seclusion\". He particularly ridiculed the lead characters' persistent inability to make obvious inferences.[9] One of the few positive reviews came from Variety which claimed it \"a beautifully mounted production\".[24] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that the film is \"more serene\" than Kleiser’s previous effort Grease, \"but it also has a nonsensical glaze that contributes to the inadvertent merriment\" and \"it tends to be enjoyably silly\".[22] She concluded, \"Nestor Almendros's cinematography is soothingly gorgeous, and so are Miss Shields and Mr. Atkins. Both are quite adequate to the movie's requirements, and neither has much acting to do--Miss Shields's hardest job, for instance, is to pretend she is giving birth to a baby without ever having wondered why she's put on so much weight. Her second hardest job is to keep the wind from ruffling her hair.\"[22]\n\nIn a retrospective review for RogerEbert.com, critic Abbey Bender wrote: \"When it comes to the depiction of burgeoning sexuality, 'The Blue Lagoon' wants to have it both ways ... with puberty making itself known through rather obvious dialogue. Sexual discovery is here the natural outcome of the storybook situation. So yes, the soft-focus montages of teen flesh are gratuitous but the film presents it all as innocent—these kids don't even know what sex is! They don't even know how a baby is made! They learn it the hard way, obviously. By couching sexuality in primitive purity, 'The Blue Lagoon' gets away with perversion that would likely be even more controversial today\".[8]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was the twelfth-biggest box office hit of 1980 in North America according to The Numbers,[25] grossing US$58,853,106 in the United States and Canada[26] on a $4.5 million budget.[27][5][28]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                     | Category                                         | Nominee(s)                                       | Result    |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards[29]        | Best Cinematography                              | Néstor Almendros                                 | Nominated |\n| Golden Globe Awards[30]   | New Star of the Year – Actor                     | Christopher Atkins                               | Nominated |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards   | Worst Actress                                    | Brooke Shields                                   | Won       |\n| Jupiter Awards            | Best International Actress                       | Brooke Shields                                   | Won       |\n| Saturn Awards             | Best Fantasy Film                                | Best Fantasy Film                                | Nominated |\n| Stinkers Bad Movie Awards | Worst Actor                                      | Christopher Atkins                               | Nominated |\n| Stinkers Bad Movie Awards | Worst Actress                                    | Brooke Shields                                   | Won       |\n| Stinkers Bad Movie Awards | Most Intrusive Musical Score                     | Basil Poledouris                                 | Won       |\n| Stinkers Bad Movie Awards | Worst On-Screen Couple                           | Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields            | Nominated |\n| Young Artist Awards[31]   | Best Major Motion Picture – Family Entertainment | Best Major Motion Picture – Family Entertainment | Nominated |\n| Young Artist Awards[31]   | Best Young Actor in a Major Motion Picture       | Christopher Atkins                               | Nominated |\n| Young Artist Awards[31]   | Best Young Actress in a Major Motion Picture     | Brooke Shields                                   | Nominated |\n\n## Versions and adaptations\n\nThe Blue Lagoon was based on Henry De Vere Stacpoole's novel of the same name, which first appeared in 1908. The first film adaptation of the book was the British silent 1923 film of that name, which is now lost. There was another British adaptation in 1949.[32]\n\nThe sequel Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991) picks up where The Blue Lagoon left off, except with confirmation that Richard and Emmeline are dead when found in the boat. Their son is rescued.[33]\n\nA television adaptation of the novel by TV network Lifetime, Blue Lagoon: The Awakening, was released in 2012.[34]\n\nThe Indian film Ina (1982), directed by I. V. Sasi, is inspired by The Blue Lagoon and The Emerald Forest (1985). The story is set in the Indian state of Kerala and explores teen lust, child marriage and the consequences. The Indian film Teri Baahon Mein (1984) and the Hindi film Jaan Ki Kasam (1991) are also inspired by it.[35]\n\n## Home media\n\nThe Special Edition DVD, with both widescreen and fullscreen versions, was released on October 5, 1999. Its special features include the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette called An Adventure in Filmmaking: The Making of The Blue Lagoon, a personal photo album by Brooke Shields, audio commentary by Randal Kleiser and Christopher Atkins, and another commentary by Kleiser, Shields, and Douglas Day Stewart.[36] The film was re-released in 2005 as part of a two-pack with its sequel, Return to the Blue Lagoon.[37]\n\nA limited-edition Blu-ray disc of the film was released on December 11, 2012, by Twilight Time.[38] The Blu-ray includes an isolated score track and three original teasers, in addition to the special features ported from the 1999 DVD release.[39][40]\n\nThe 1980 movie was made available for streaming through services such as Amazon Video and Vudu.[41][42]\n\n## See also\n\n- The Blue Lagoon, 1923 version\n- The Blue Lagoon, 1949 version\n- Paradise, 1982 film\n- Return to the Blue Lagoon, 1991 film\n- Blue Lagoon: The Awakening, 2012 made-for-television film\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Murray, Scott. \"The Blue Lagoon: Interview with Randal Kleiser\".

            "spanned_content": "<ReformattedArticle>\n    <Name>The Blue Lagoon</Name> is a <Genre>coming-of-age romantic survival drama</Genre> film directed by <Director>Randal Kleiser</Director> from a screenplay written by Douglas Day Stewart based on the 1908 novel of the same name by Henry De Vere Stacpoole. The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The music score was composed by Basil Poledouris, and the cinematography was by Néstor Almendros.\n\n    The film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. But without either the guidance or the restrictions of society, emotional and physical changes arise as they reach puberty, go skinny dipping in the ocean, fall in love, and end up having a child.\n\n    The Blue Lagoon was theatrically released on <ReleaseYear>June 20, 1980</ReleaseYear> by Columbia Pictures. The film was panned by critics, who disparaged its screenplay, execution, and Shields' performance, but Almendros' cinematography received praise. In spite of the criticism, the film was a commercial success, grossing $58.8 million on a $4.5 million budget and becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1980 in North America. The film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Almendros, and the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor for Atkins. Shields won the inaugural Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her work in the film.\n\n    <MainThemes>In the late Victorian period, two cousins, nine-year-old Richard and seven-year-old Emmeline Lestrange, and galley cook Paddy Button, are shipwrecked on a lush tropical island in the South Pacific. Paddy cares for the children and forbids them \"by law\" from going to the other side of the island, where he finds an altar with bloody remains from human sacrifices. He also warns them against eating any deadly scarlet berries. He dies after a drunken binge, and the children rebuild their home on a different part of the island.</MainThemes>\n\n    Having reached puberty, the two go skinny dipping in the ocean, but Emmeline is uncomfortable with her sexual attraction to Richard and declines to share her \"funny\" thoughts with him. She is frightened by her first menstrual period and refuses to allow Richard to inspect her for what he imagines is a wound.\n\n    Eventually, Richard recognizes his attraction to Emmeline. She ventures to the forbidden side of the island and sees the altar. Associating the blood with Christ's crucifixion, she concludes that the altar is God and tries to persuade Richard to go to the other side of the island to pray with her. Richard is shocked at the idea of breaking the law and they argue. When Richard tries to initiate sexual contact with Emmeline, she rebuffs him. He hides from her and masturbates.\n\n    When a ship appears for the first time in years, Emmeline does not light the signal fire and the ship passes by without noticing them. When Richard confronts Emmeline about her failure, she asserts to his angry disbelief that the island is now their home and that they should remain there. Emmeline also reveals that she knows about Richard's masturbation and threatens to tell her Uncle Arthur about this. They fight and she throws a coconut at him, hitting him in the head by chance. Richard angrily slaps her and kicks her out of their shelter.\n\n    Emmeline steps on a venomous stonefish. Weak from the poison, she pleads with Richard to \"take [her] to God\". Richard carries her across the island and places her on the altar. Emmeline recovers and they swim naked in the lagoon. Noticing their bodies' reactions, they discover sexual intercourse and become lovers. Neither recognizes what is happening when Emmeline becomes pregnant, and they are stunned to feel the baby move inside her abdomen, assuming her stomach is causing the movements.\n\n    Months later, Richard observes indigenous people performing a human sacrifice in front of the statue. He becomes frightened and runs away to find Emmeline, whom he finds in labor. Emmeline gives birth to a baby boy, whom they name Paddy.\n\n    A ship led by Richard's father, Arthur, approaches the island and sees the family playing on the shore. Content with their lives, Richard and Emmeline walk away instead of signaling for help. Arthur assumes the mud-covered couple are not Richard and Emmeline.\n\n    Visiting their original homesite, Richard searches for bananas while Paddy, unnoticed, brings a branch of the scarlet berries into the boat with Emmeline. Paddy tosses an oar out of the boat as it drifts from the shore. Richard swims after them followed closely by a shark. Emmeline throws the other oar at the shark, striking it and giving Richard time to get into the boat. The boat drifts oarless out to sea.\n\n    After drifting for days, Richard and Emmeline wake up to find Paddy eating the scarlet berries. Hopeless, Richard and Emmeline eat the berries as well, and lie down to await death. Some hours later, Arthur's ship finds them. Arthur asks, \"Are they dead?\" The officer assures him, \"No, sir. They're asleep.\"\n\n    <CulturalContext>The film was a passion project of Randal Kleiser, who had long admired the original novel. He hired Douglas Day Stewart, who had written The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976), to write the script and met up with Richard Franklin, the Australian director, who was looking for work in Hollywood. This gave him the idea to use an Australian crew, which Franklin helped supervise.</CulturalContext>\n\n    <EmotionalDepth>Shields was 14 years of age when she appeared in the film. All of her nude scenes were performed by the film's 32-year-old stunt coordinator, Kathy Troutt. Shields did many of her topless scenes with her hair glued to her breasts. Atkins was 18 when the movie was filmed, and he performed his own nude scenes (which included brief frontal nudity).</EmotionalDepth>\n\n    <ComplexityLevel>On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 12% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A piece of lovely dreck, The Blue Lagoon is a naughty fantasy that's also too chaste to be truly entertaining\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".</ComplexityLevel>\n\n    <AdditionalInformation>\n        {\n            \"Budget\": \"$4.5 million\",\n            \"BoxOffice\": \"$58.8 million\",\n            \"Awards\": {\n                \"AcademyAwards\": \"Nominated for Best Cinematography\",\n                \"GoldenGlobeAwards\": \"Nominated for New Star of the Year – Actor\",\n                \"GoldenRaspberryAwards\": \"Won for Worst Actress\"\n            }\n        }\n    </AdditionalInformation>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly structuring it according to the specified attributes, making it more readable and informative for the audience.",

Hughes explores the theme through the character of Vice Principal Richard Vernon, who oversees the all-day detention of Bender, Claire, Andrew, Brian, and Allison. Vernon attempts to impose his authority by placing unrealistic demands on the students, shouting at them to stay still and not speak for the next eight hours. Throughout the course of the film, Vernon continues to act tough with the students, treating them as miscreants whose freedom should be restricted. However, his attempts at strong-arming respect ultimately fail, because the students can see through Vernon's act and perceive the insecurity that fuels his need for obedience. In this way, Hughes portrays Vernon's authoritarian attitude as a compensation for his failure to earn genuine respect from others.\n\n## Rebellion\n\nAs a counterpoint to authoritarianism, Hughes addresses the theme of rebellion in The Breakfast Club. When Vernon attempts to impose his will on the detention students, Bender is provoked to rebel, and he defies Vernon's authority at every opportunity. Bender's first act of rebellion is to speak to the others as soon as Vernon leaves the room. While the others initially resist Bender's rule-breaking, they soon join in and speak with him. Bender's next move is to make it so the door to Vernon's office won't stay propped open. With this act, Bender wins back the students' privacy by making it so Vernon can't spy on them as easily. As the film goes on, Bender continues to lead the other students in rebellious acts, which include tearing up old books, smoking pot, running up the walls, climbing furniture, and crawling through air ducts. The film concludes on one last act of rebellion: rejecting the premise of Vernon's essay assignment in a curt note. However, it isn't Bender who writes the note, but Brian, the brainy member of the group who, through Bender's example, has found that he too has the capacity and desire to question authority.\n\n## Resentment\n\nResentment is another major theme in the film. Defined as the bitter indignation that follows unfair treatment, resentment first arises in The Breakfast Club when Vernon addresses the group at the beginning of their detention. By treating them with disrespect, Vernon reveals that he resents having to spend his Saturday watching over the group of troublemakers. Bender also reveals his resentful nature when he takes shots at Claire, Brian, and Andrew—people he doesn't like because he sees them as far more privileged than he. Claire soon confesses to resenting both of her parents, who have neglected her following their divorce. Brian also resents his parents; in his case, it is because they put too much pressure on him to excel in academics. For Andrew, his resentment stems from being raised by a bullying father who is obsessed with winning. Similarly, Bender has been raised by a violent, overbearing father who instilled in Bender a desire to rebel and lash out at others. Allison isn't immune either: she resents her parents for emotionally neglecting her. Although Hughes portrays resentment as a negative emotion, resentment is also something that helps bring the students together as they bond over their indignation at having been mistreated by authority figures.\n\n## Social Division\n\nSocial division is another important theme in The Breakfast Club. The theme enters the story when the students begin their detention and it becomes clear that the individuals in the group have little in common—at least superficially. Through the characters' dialogue, Hughes establishes that the only two in the group who know each other are Claire and Andrew, because they are both members of the popular set. Brian, branded as a \"dork\" by Bender, belongs to the quiet, nerdy, over-achieving crowd, and only associates with other academically gifted kids. Bender is a rebel \"burner\" who hangs out with other grungy, drug-taking kids, and Allison is a socially outcast girl who appears to not have any social skills. Despite these social divisions, the students come to learn that they are more similar than it would seem, as they each struggle to relate to their dysfunctional families and are inclined to repress their feelings of resentment and grief. Through sharing their problems with each other, the students see beyond the arbitrary social divisions that have defined them and learn to relate on a more intimate, universal level.\n\n## Family Dysfunction\n\nFamily dysfunction is a major theme in The Breakfast Club. Defined as deviation from the healthy norms of behavior within a family, family dysfunction enters the film when Claire speaks of how her parents have been using her as a weapon in their acrimonious divorce, adding that she would prefer to live with her older brother if she could. Bender also comes from an extremely dysfunctional family, explaining to the others that his father is physically abusive. For Andrew, the issue is being pushed into sports by an unfeeling monster of a father. For Allison, it is being neglected by her parents, who ignore her cries for attention. For Brian, it is being pushed by parents to keep perfect grades without them accounting for the psychological toll so much pressure can take. Ultimately, Hughes shows that each of the students in the Shermer High School Saturday detention is dealing with unaddressed family dysfunction in some form. However, an unsympathetic figure like Vernon lacks the imagination to consider the roots of the students' misbehavior.\n\n## Emotional Repression\n\nEmotional repression—the action of restraining the expression or examination of one's feelings—is another key theme in The Breakfast Club. Having grown up in dysfunctional homes where feelings were minimized in one way or another, the students at the center of the film have been implicitly taught by their parents to push down any negative emotions that arise. This repression can often lead to acting out, which Bender exhibits when he provokes reactions from Vernon and the other students. In undermining others, Bender relieves the internal pressure of the anger and grief he feels in regard to his parents. Allison is another strong case of emotional repression: Seemingly mute when the film begins, Allison draws attention to herself with bizarre outbursts. When she finally opens up about the grief she feels at being neglected by her parents, she can barely put words to her pent-up emotions. Similarly, Andrew suppresses his resentment of his father; when he gets high, however, Andrew shouts and dances and flexes his muscles, letting himself release some of the tension. With these depictions, Hughes shows the destructive effects of bottling up one's emotions and the satisfaction that comes with letting go.\n\n## Bonding\n\nBonding—the establishment of a relationship based on shared feelings—is another crucial theme in The Breakfast Club. At the beginning of the film, it seems the only thing that unites the five students is the fact they must serve all-day detention on the weekend. However, the students soon find they have shared feelings that result from living in similarly difficult circumstances. As the students each establish that they resent their parents and wish they could escape the pressures of teenage life, they reach a level of understanding among each other; most feel safe enough to be vulnerable and shed tears in front of the others. At the end of the film, the group cements their bond by submitting one essay to Vernon that Brian writes on all of their behalf, presenting a united front in defiance of his abusive authority. Hughes further emphasizes the group's newly forged bond by showing the burgeoning relationships of Claire and Bender, and Allison and Andrew. Both couples have seen past the superficial divisions of high-school cliques and discovered genuine emotional connections.\n\n##### How To Cite https://www.gradesaver.com/the-breakfast-club/study-guide/themes in MLA Format\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Study Guide Navigation\n- About The Breakfast Club\n- The Breakfast Club Summary\n- Character List\n- Cast List\n- Director's Influence\n- Glossary\n- Themes\n- Quotes and Analysis\n- Summary And Analysis\n    - 0:00 – 0:19\n    - 0:20 – 0:38\n    - 0:39 – 0:58\n    - 0:59 – 1:18\n    - 1:19 – 1:37\n- Symbols, Allegory and Motifs\n- Irony\n- Imagery\n- About the Brat Pack\n- Literary Elements\n- Essay Questions\n- Quizzes - Test Yourself!\n    - Quiz 1\n    - Quiz 2\n    - Quiz 3\n    - Quiz 4\n- Citations\n- Related Content\n- Study Guide\n- Essays\n- Q &amp;amp; A\n- John Hughes Biography\n\n#### The Breakfast Club Questions and Answers\n\nThe Question and Answer section for The Breakfast Club is a great\nresource to ask questions, find answers, and discuss the novel.\n\n### Study Guide for The Breakfast Club\n\nThe Breakfast Club study guide contains a biography of director John Hughes, literature essays, quiz questions, major themes, characters, and a full summary and analysis.\n\n- About The Breakfast Club\n- The Breakfast Club Summary\n- Character List\n- Cast List\n- Director's Influence\n\n### Essays for The Breakfast Club\n\nThe Breakfast Club essays are academic essays for citation.

Oppressed by their own poverty, most of them come from difficult family lives, so they stick together as a way of simulating the home life they do not have. The entire structure of a gang itself is built on loyalty to the gang, and a sense of maintaining that loyalty. Even when Ponyboy seeks to find connection with Socs (like Cherry and Randy) he keeps a firm grip on the loyalty he feels towards his brothers in the gang. The Greasers show loyalty to one another in many instances. Dally helps Johnny and Ponyboy get out of town after the murder of Bob. He also follows them into the burning church to help them, even though he disapproves of their reckless act.\n\n## Violence\n\nViolence abounds in the world of the film, which is part of why the boys stay so loyal to one another. When a Greaser comes upon a Soc, violence is almost certain to break out. The only reason Bob doesn't start a fight with Ponyboy and the others after the drive-in movie is that the girls are there. Then later at the playground, the Socs descend on Johnny and Ponyboy, almost drowning in a nearby fountain. The only thing that seems to prevent Bob from drowning Ponyboy is the intervention of Johnny, who stabs Bob. In the world of the film, 16 year old boys must resort to violence to protect their friends. Violence is both the only option and the worst symptom of the adolescent angst that pervades the Tulsa of the film. After Johnny dies, Dally does not know how to grieve the loss, and instead resorts to a violent performance, ending in his own death at the hands of the police.\n\n## Observation vs. Action\n\nPonyboy is an active member of the gang, and wants to participate in the rumble, but he is also distinguished from his fellow gang members by his relative gentleness. He is strong and silent where others are rough-housing and wild. He is the thoughtful member of the group, content to observe rather than join in the fight. He reassures Cherry that he would not hurt Bob, after Two-Bit hands him a broken bottle to use as a weapon. While he must assume the postures of a violent gang member, he is not a man of action. Rather, he is a writer, recording all of the events of the film in his composition book.\n\n## Protection and Self-Reliance\n\nAlong with the loyalty of the gang, the boys show one another a certain amount of protection. Evidently, none of their parents can offer them protection from the violence of their neighborhood and community. Thus, the boys need to protect one another. Darry tries to be a responsible guardian for Ponyboy in the beginning, but his protective impulses come out as abuse. Dally, on the other hand, is happy to act as a protector. He takes a great deal of responsibility for Johnny and Ponyboy after Johnny kills Bob. He tells them where to go, he comes and finds them in a few days, and he treats them like his much-loved younger brothers. However, Dally also has a complicated relationship to dependence and self-reliance, and becomes upset when Johnny ends up in the hospital. He tells Ponyboy, \"You watch out for yourself, and nothing can touch you man!\" Dally's main lesson for the boys is to teach them to look out for themselves; but, rather ironically, he struggles to do just that.\n\n## Abandonment and Loss\n\nAll of the characters in The Outsiders struggle with a distinct fear of abandonment. Particularly, Johnny and Ponyboy are orphans; Ponyboy literally and Johnny emotionally. Ponyboy grieves the loss of his parents and the strain that their loss has put on his brothers. Johnny feels neglected by his abusive parents, who argue violently and hardly care if he comes home. Johnny's feelings of emotional neglect even drive him to consider suicide. He feels so abused by the world and his home situation that he wants to kill himself. Ponyboy has lost his parents, and fears being taken away from the care of his brothers, the only family he has.\n\n## Class\n\nThe main distinction between the Greasers and the Socs is one of class. The Greasers are impoverished and live on the wrong side of the tracks, while the Socs live in affluent and stable households on the south side of Tulsa. The Greasers wear their hair long and greased, and sport tight jeans and ripped t-shirts, while the Socs have close-cropped hairstyles, wear khakis and collared shirts, and drive nice cars. Class tension is what creates the violence of the plot.\n\n## Gender\n\nWhile the majority of the movie depicts homosocial configurations—boys spending time with other boys—the introduction of Cherry and her best friend Marcia early in the film introduces the potential of romance, and shows the gendered differences in the community. While the two gangs are divided by class distinctions, the girls find a way to bridge that gap by striking up conversation with the Greasers at the drive-in movie. Ponyboy and Cherry's relationship is not quite romantic, but her presence is almost maternal to the orphaned boy, who wants to get to know her and feels he can trust her. Dallas is clearly taken with Cherry, but does not know how to express his feelings properly. Cherry admits to an attraction for Dallas, but only hints at this to Ponyboy in a fleeting moment.\n\n##### How To Cite https://www.gradesaver.com/the-outsiders-film/study-guide/themes in MLA Format\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Study Guide Navigation\n- About The Outsiders (film)\n- The Outsiders (film) Summary\n- Character List\n- Cast List\n- Director's Influence\n- Glossary\n- Themes\n- Quotes and Analysis\n- Summary And Analysis\n    - Part 1: The Drive-In Movie\n    - Part 2: Johnny's Crime\n    - Part 3: Country Living\n    - Part 4: Ponyboy's Homecoming\n    - Part 5: Conclusion\n- Symbols, Allegory and Motifs\n- Irony\n- Imagery\n- S.

This is true, although to be completely accurate, all the actors would have to speak in German and the film would have had to be subtitled as a result.\n\nIn truth, however, none of these criticisms actually matters a damn. For even though all of the above is undeniably true, the film still works. And my, how it works. When it finished, I sat in my seat stunned (I had the same reaction after watching \"Disaster Movie\" last week, but most definitely not for the same reason, I assure you).\n\nThe Holocaust as seen through the prism of 8 year old German boy is a novel approach and although we all know what is happening at the camp nearby, at the beginning, he does not. And every step he takes, he gets closer to discovering the truth, losing his childhood innocence in the process.\n\nWhat I liked about this film is the sophisticated and multi-layered portrayal of the German characters. None of them are one dimensional wholly evil characters but nor are they wholly good either (not even Bruno who tells lies on several occasions, one occasion which results in brutal punishment for one of the prisoners as a consequence).\n\n- Torontoman224\n- Feb 17, 2012\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ26\n\n- How long is The Boy in the Striped Pajamas?Powered by Alexa\n- Is \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\" based on a book?\n- How do Bruno and Shmuel meet?\n- If the movie is set in Germany, why do they have English accents?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - April 23, 2009 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official Site\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - El niño con el pijama de rayas\n- Filming locations\n    - Kerepesi Cemetery, Budapest, Hungary\n- Production companies\n    - Miramax\n    - BBC Film\n    - Heyday Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $12,500,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $9,046,156\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $253,085\n    - Nov 9, 2008\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $40,416,563\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 34 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - SDDS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) in France?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is based on the historical novel Schindler's Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally. The film follows Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than a thousand mostly Polish–Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing them in his factories during World War II. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.\n\nIdeas for a film about the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it himself.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Kraków, Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in black and white and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński wanted to create a sense of timelessness. John Williams composed the score, and violinist Itzhak Perlman performed the main theme.\n\nSchindler's List premiered on November 30, 1993, in Washington, D.C., and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States. Often listed as one of the greatest films ever made,[4][5][6][7] the film received widespread acclaim for the tone, acting, atmosphere, score, cinematography, and Spielberg's direction. It was a box office success, earning $322.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget. It was nominated for twelve awards at the 66th Academy Awards, and won seven including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film won numerous other awards, including seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked Schindler's List 8th on its list of the 100 greatest American films. The film was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress in 2004 and selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn German-occupied Kraków during World War II, the Nazis force local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Kraków Ghetto. Oskar Schindler, a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware. Schindler hires Itzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.\n\nSS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of the Płaszów concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.\n\nAs the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Brünnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau. Göth reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic paraphrase: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car. When the Schindlerjuden awaken the next morning, a mounted Soviet officer announces they have been liberated but warns them not to go east because \"they hate you there\". The Jews then walk into the countryside.\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Göth was executed via hanging for crimes against humanity; Schindler and his wife were declared Righteous Among the Nations and a tree was planted in his honor in the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations. Many of the surviving Schindlerjuden and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker (a traditional Jewish sign of respect for the dead), after which Liam Neeson lays two roses.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(left) portrays  in .\n\n- Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler\n- Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern\n- Ralph Fiennes as Amon Göth\n- Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler\n- Jonathan Sagall as Poldek Pfefferberg\n- Embeth Davidtz as Helen Hirsch\n- Małgorzata Gebel as Wiktoria Klonowska\n- Mark Ivanir as Marcel Goldberg\n- Beatrice Macola as Ingrid\n- Andrzej Seweryn as Julian Scherner\n- Friedrich von Thun as Rolf Czurda\n- Jerzy Nowak as Investor\n- Norbert Weisser as Albert Hujar\n- Albert Misak as Mordecai Wulkan\n- Michael Gordon as\tMr. Nussbaum\n- Aldona Grochal as\tMrs. Nussbaum\n- Uri Avrahami\tas Chaim Nowak\n- Michael Schneider as Juda Dresner\n- Miri Fabian as Chaja Dresner\n- Anna Mucha as Danka Dresner\n- Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n- Jacek Wójcicki as\tHenry Rosner\n- Beata Paluch as Manci Rosner\n- Piotr Polk as Leo Rosner\n- Bettina Kupfer as Regina Perlman\n- Grzegorz Kwas as Mietek Pemper\n- Kamil Krawiec as Olek Rosner\n- Henryk Bista as Mr. Löwenstein\n- Ezra Dagan as\tRabbi Menasha Levartov\n- Rami Heuberger as Joseph Bau\n- Elina Löwensohn as Diana Reiter\n- Krzysztof Luft as\tHerman Toffel\n- Harry Nehring\tas Leo John\n- Wojciech Klata as Lisiek\n- Paweł Deląg as Dolek Horowitz\n- Hans-Jörg Assmann\tas Julius Madritsch\n- August Schmölzer as Dieter Reeder\n- Hans-Michael Rehberg as Rudolf Höß\n- Daniel Del Ponte as Josef Mengele\n- Adam Siemion as Adam Levy\n- Jochen Nickel as Wilhelm Kunde\n- Ludger Pistor as Josef Leipold[a]\n- Oliwia Dąbrowska as the Girl in Red\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nPoldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior. Pfefferberg attempted to produce a biopic of Oskar Schindler with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1963, with Howard Koch writing, but the deal fell through.[9][10] In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novel Schindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.[11] MCA president Sid Sheinberg sent director Steven Spielberg a New York Times review of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"[12] Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.[12] At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.[13] In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.[14]\n\nThe liquidation of the Kraków Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".[13] Spielberg tried to pass the project to director Roman Polanski, but he refused Spielberg's offer. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Kraków Ghetto.[13] Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama The Pianist (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese, who was attached to direct Schindler's List in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as  \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"[15] Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the 1991 remake of Cape Fear instead.[16] Scorsese would later admit in an interview that while he believed his version of the film might've been good, he had no regrets passing it to Spielberg stating that \"it would not have been the hit that it became\".[17] Billy Wilder expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.[18] Brian De Palma also refused an offer to direct.[19]\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that Holocaust deniers were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of neo-Nazism after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.[18] Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made Jurassic Park first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed Schindler I wouldn't be able to do Jurassic Park.\"[2] The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.[20][2] Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"blood money\",[2] and believed it would fail.[2]\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired Kurt Luedtke, who had adapted the screenplay of Out of Africa, to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.[15] During his time as director, Scorsese hired Steven Zaillian to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous instead of a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He also extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"[15]\n\n### Casting\n\nLiam Neeson auditioned as Schindler early on in the film's development. He was cast in December 1992 after Spielberg saw him perform in Anna Christie on Broadway.[21] Warren Beatty participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".[22] Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson so that the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.[23] Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as somewhat naïve. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"[24] To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of Time Warner CEO Steve Ross, who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.[25] He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.[26]\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his performances in A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"[27] Fiennes put on 28 pounds (13 kg) to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"[27] Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth's character in the film as a classic psychopath.[28] Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.[27]\n\nThe character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory manager Abraham Bankier, and Göth's personal secretary, Mietek Pemper.[29] The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.[30] Dustin Hoffman was offered the role but he refused it.[31][32]\n\nOverall, there are 126 parts with dialogue in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.[15] Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.[33] Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the film.[22] Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the Schindlerjuden and fly them in to film the scene.[15]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 1, 1993, in Kraków, Poland, with a planned schedule of 75 days.[34] The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the Płaszów camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.[35][36] Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Kraków were filmed at a similar facility in Olkusz, while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.[37] The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the World Jewish Congress.[38] To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.[39]\n\nThere were some antisemitic incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him: \"The Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it.\"[27] Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,[15] while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted the Israeli actor Michael Schneider.[40] Nonetheless, Spielberg said that, at Passover, \"all the German actors showed up. They put on yarmulkes and opened up Haggadas, and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.\"[40]\n\nI was hit in the face with my personal life. My upbringing. My Jewishness. The stories my grandparents told me about the Shoah. And Jewish life came pouring back into my heart. I cried all the time.\n\nShooting Schindler's List was deeply emotional for Spielberg, as the subject matter forced him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead, he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during the shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.[42] Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a film.[35] Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.[22] Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming.[43] He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row ... when things just got too unbearable\".[44] Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.[44]\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing Jurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.[45]\n\nSpielberg occasionally used German and Polish language dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading [subtitles]. It would have been an excuse [for the audience] to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"[22]\n\n### Cinematography\n\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film Shoah, Spielberg decided not to plan the film with storyboards, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.[46] Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"[47] He filmed without using Steadicams, elevated shots, or zoom lenses, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"[47] This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as Cecil B. DeMille or David Lean.[40]\n\nSpielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of documentary footage of the era. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński compared the effect to German Expressionism and Italian neorealism.[47] Kamiński said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made\".[35] Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color negative, to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events\".[47] However, scenes with the girl in the red coat were shot in color, and later rotoscoped over by hand to remove all color except for the coat.[48]\n\n### Music\n\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for Schindler's List. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, \"You need a better composer than I am for this film.\" Spielberg responded, \"I know. But they're all dead!\"[49] Itzhak Perlman performs the theme on the violin.[14]\n\nIn the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk song Oyfn Pripetshik (Yiddish: אויפֿן פּריפּעטשיק, 'On the Cooking Stove') is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.[50] The clarinet solos heard in the film were recorded by Klezmer virtuoso Giora Feidman.[51] Williams won an Academy Award for Best Original Score for Schindler's List, his fifth win.[52] Selections from the score were released on a soundtrack album.[53]\n\n## Themes and symbolism\n\nThe film explores the theme of good and evil, using as its main protagonist a \"good German\", a popular characterization in American cinema.[54][18] While Göth is portrayed as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero.[55] Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.[56][57]\n\n### The girl in red\n\nSchindler sees a girl in red during the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. He said: \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down ... the annihilation of European Jewry. So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"[58] Andy Patrizio of IGN notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance\".[59] Professor André H. Caron of the Université de Montréal wonders if the red symbolizes \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust\".[60]\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia Dąbrowska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked Dąbrowska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".[61] Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.[61] Roma Ligocka, who says she was known in the Kraków Ghetto for her red coat, feels the character might have been based on her. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir (2002, in translation).[62] Alternatively, according to her relatives who were interviewed in 2014, the girl may have been inspired by Kraków resident Genya Gitel Chil.[63]\n\n### Candles\n\nThe opening scene features a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit ... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins\".[15] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth through color. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"[15] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.[64] She points out that normally, the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film, it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.[65]\n\n### Other symbolism\n\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"[66] Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in Nazi Germany between making use of the Jews for slave labor or exterminating them outright.[67] Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a Holocaust train loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.[68]\n\n## Release\n\nSchindler's List opened in theaters on December 15, 1993, in the United States and December 25 in Canada. Its premiere in Germany was on March 1, 1994.[69] Its American network television premiere was on NBC on February 23, 1997. Shown uncut and without commercials, it ranked No. 3 for the week with a 20.9/31 rating/share,[70] the highest Nielsen rating for any film since NBC's broadcast of Jurassic Park in May 1995. The film aired on public television in Israel on Holocaust Memorial Day in 1998.[71]\n\nThe film was released in a THX widescreen VHS format on September 9, 1997.[72] The DVD was released on March 9, 2004, in widescreen and full screen editions, on a double-sided disc with the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg.[73] Also released for both formats was a limited edition gift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally's novel, the film's soundtrack on CD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titled Schindler's List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film, all housed in a plexiglass case.[74] The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet.[75] As part of its 20th anniversary, the film was released on Blu-ray Disc on March 5, 2013.[76] The film was digitally remastered in 4K, Dolby Vision and Atmos and was reissued into theaters on December 7, 2018, for its 25th anniversary.[77] The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 18, 2018.[78]\n\nFollowing the success of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit organization with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work.[79] Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998).[80]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nSteven Spielberg won his first Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director with Schindler's List.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchindler's List received acclaim from both film critics and audiences, with Americans such as talk show host Oprah Winfrey and President Bill Clinton urging others to see it.[81][82] World leaders in many countries saw the film, and some met personally with Spielberg.[81][83] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received an approval rating of 98% based on 137 reviews, with an average rating of 9.20/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Schindler's List blends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg's signature tender humanism to create the director's dramatic masterpiece.\"[84] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 30 critics.[85] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.[86]\n\nStephen Schiff of The New Yorker called it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a film that \"will take its place in cultural history and remain there.\"[87] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and described it as Spielberg's best, \"brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen.\"[88] Ebert and Gene Siskel named it the best film of 1993.[89] Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's \"narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.\" He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise,[90] and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz \"the most terrifying sequence ever filmed.\"[91] In the 2013 edition of his Movie and Video Guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the picture a four-out-of-four-star rating; he described the film as a \"staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller ... with such frenzied pacing that it looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before ... Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".[92] James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"[93] In his review for The New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"[94] Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".[95] He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.[96] The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.[97]\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.[98] Sara Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.[99] Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.[100] History professor Omer Bartov of Brown University notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.[101]\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the film does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.[102] Author Jason Epstein commented that the film gives the false impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust.[103] Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.[104]\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\". He describes the humanization of Schindler as \"banal\", and is critical of what he describes as the \"Zionist closure\" set to the song \"Jerusalem of Gold\".[105]\n\nHolocaust film scholar Rich Brownstein wrote, \"The most powerful object in our Holocaust universe is Schindler's List; the most dangerous activity in our Holocaust universe is criticizing Schindler's List.\"[106]  Brownstein opines that Schindler's List should be treated no differently than any other white savior narrative in film and that the Amon Göth character bloated the film with an unnecessary supervillain. Brownstein particularly objects to \"the most obnoxious fake gas/shower scene of any film – replete with 70 seconds of anticipation before water finally flows.\"[107]\n\n### Assessment by other filmmakers\n\nSchindler's List was very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"[18] Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"[108] He cited Schindler's List as an influence on his 1994 film Death and the Maiden.[109] Martin Scorsese, who passed the film back to Spielberg and stated his version had different ideas from the final film including a different ending, would later comment \"I admired the film greatly.\"[17] The success of Schindler's List led filmmaker Stanley Kubrick to abandon his own Holocaust project, Aryan Papers, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.[110] According to scriptwriter Frederic Raphael, when he suggested to Kubrick that Schindler's List was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.\"[110][b]\n\nFilmmaker Jean-Luc Godard accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife, Emilie Schindler, lived in poverty in Argentina.[112] Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"[113] He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.[113] Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well – but it was dumb.\"[114]\n\nClaude Lanzmann, the director of the nine-hour Holocaust documentary Shoah (1985), called Schindler's List a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse\". He said: \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before Shoah, and a time after Shoah, and that after Shoah certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"[115]\n\n### Reaction of the Jewish community\n\nAt a 1994 Village Voice symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.[116] Hungarian Jewish author Imre Kertész, a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.[117] Rabbi Uri D. Herscher found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.[118] Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.[119] Albert L. Lewis, Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the film as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"[118]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $96.1 million ($209 million in 2024 dollars)[120] in the United States and Canada and over $321.2 million worldwide.[121] In Germany, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone from 48 screens[122][123] and was eventually shown in 500 theaters (including 80 paid for by municipal authorities),[124] with a total of six million admissions and a gross of $38 million.[125][126][127] Its 25th anniversary showings grossed $551,000 in 1,029 theaters.[128]\n\n### Accolades\n\nSpielberg won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film for his work,[129] and shared the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R. Molen.[130] Steven Zaillian won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.[131] The film also won the National Board of Review for Best Film, along with the National Society of Film Critics for Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Cinematography. Awards from the New York Film Critics Circle were also won for Best Film, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Cinematographer.

The theme of the film is to reveal the brutality and cruelty of the Nazi soldiers to the Jews. It seems the illustration is propaganda with the purpose of asking for sympathy as well as to tarnish the other race.[145]\n\nThe Prime Minister of Malaysia at the time, Mahathir Mohamad, said that Malaysians \"have the right to ban any movie\". He went on to say, \"I'm not antisemitic... I'm anti-Zionist expansion (and) the conquest of Arab territories by Zionists\".[145]\n\nThe film was also banned in Indonesia, where the Committee for World Muslim Solidarity described it as \"nothing but Zionist propaganda.\"[146]\n\nIn the Philippines, chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting sexual intercourse and female nudity before the film could be shown in cinemas. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the Senate to demand the abolition of the censorship board. President Fidel V. Ramos himself intervened, ruling that the film could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.[147]\n\nAccording to Slovak filmmaker Juraj Herz, the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film Zastihla mě noc (The Night Overtakes Me, 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.[148]\n\nThe song \"Yerushalayim Shel Zahav\" (\"Jerusalem of Gold\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by Naomi Shemer) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the Six-Day War. In Israeli prints of the film, the song was replaced with \"Halikha LeKesariya\" (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by Hannah Szenes, a World War II resistance fighter.[149]\n\nFor the 1997 American television showing, the film was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year.[150] Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".[151] Under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".[152]\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on ProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each. Ignatz Bubis, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".[125] Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"[125] As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.[125]\n\n## Legacy\n\nSchindler's List featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the TIME magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel,[4] Time Out magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,[153] and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".[5] The Vatican included Schindler's List in its list of 45 important films – the latest-released entry to make the list.[154] A Channel 4 poll named Schindler's List the ninth greatest film of all time,[6] and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.[155] The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as James Berardinelli,[156] Roger Ebert,[89] and Gene Siskel.[157] Deeming the film \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\", the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2004.[158] The film was shown at the Berlinale Film Festival in February 2023, at which Spielberg received an honorary Golden Bear award.[159]\n\nDue to the increased interest in Kraków created by the film, the city bought Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.[160]\n\n## See also\n\n- 1993 in film\n- List of Holocaust films\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"[8]\n- ^ Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.[111]\n- ^  Williams also won a Grammy for the film's musical score.

River Phoenix had so much potential, such an angel like person, it adds so much more depth to the film that wasn't originally meant to be there."
