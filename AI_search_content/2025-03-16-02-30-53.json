Well, let’s be more specific. First off, you’re definitely in the mood for a thriller, right? Not a horror situation? (If you want that, head here.) While a thriller can be scary and horror can be thrilling, the difference between the two is right in the name. Horror films are predictably meant to horrify you with some evil that needs to be destroyed or at least escaped. Meanwhile, thrillers are unpredictable, which is part of what builds the tension that’s meant to — you guessed it — thrill you.\n\n## Popular Now\n\n- ExplainerWhy Did Jamie Do It?

There are lots: psychological, mystery, high-stakes operation (think action, crime, legal, political, spy, sci-fi save-the-world stuff). If they’re any good, all thrillers at some point become so heart-racing, so sweat-inducing, so completely captivating that you don’t dare pause them — even though you’ve really had to pee for the last seven minutes. Those are the thrillers worth your time — and worth making this list. So, because it wouldn’t be fair to hold you in suspense, here are some of the best thrillers you can stream right now. (Bladders, be warned.)\n\n### Bird Box\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Postapocalyptic\n\nWhen someone tells you, “Don’t look,” fighting the urge becomes almost impossible. But in Bird Box, it’s a matter of life or death. Based on a 2014 novel with the same name, this 2018 film follows Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) on a journey of survival. The world is overrun with off-camera entities that cause anyone who looks at them to commit suicide. We meet Malorie as she’s instructing two children (Vivien Lyra Blair and Julian Edwards) to float down a river blindfolded, but then quickly jump back five years to a pregnant Malorie and her visiting sister (Sarah Paulson). A news broadcast warns that unexplained mass suicides are spreading and things are, ahem, not looking good. As Malorie fights for her life, she encounters friends and enemies — including Tom (Trevante Rhodes), Olympia (Danielle Macdonald), Greg (BD Wong), Douglas (John Malkovich), Lucy (Rosa Salazar), and Felix (Machine Gun Kelly). And while none of them are supposed to open their eyes in the monsters’ presence, you won’t be able to look away.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBird Box\n\n2h 4m   MA 15+   2018\n\n### The Call\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Sci-fi mystery\n\nSeo-yeon (Park Shin-hye) returns to her childhood home on her way to visit her sick and estranged mother.

During their calls, Seo-yeon realizes Yeong-sook is living in the same house — but 20 years ago. The two women become friends, learning about each other’s lives over the phone while communicating across time. Then one day, Seo-yeon and Yeong-sook make a small choice that will forever change their lives in their respective timelines.

Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) spends his days as an unmotivated TSA agent at Los Angeles’ LAX airport. One good thing he’s got going for him? He and girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) are expecting their first child. So when Ethan arrives to work on Christmas Eve, he convinces his supervisor (Dean Norris) to put him on bag monitoring duty — angling for a promotion now that they’ve got a baby on the way. But soon after, an earbud comes through in a screening bin and a mysterious text instructs Ethan to insert it. Suddenly, he’s talking to a lethal mercenary known only as “Traveler” (Jason Bateman), who instructs Ethan to let a dangerous carry-on suitcase pass through. And if he doesn’t? Nora will be killed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarry-On\n\n1h 59m   M   2024\n\n### Don't Move\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Horror\n\n“Don't move.” Two words frequently uttered by threatening baddies to their victims, but Iris (Kelsey Asbille) has no choice. During an attack by a stranger (Finn Wittrock) in a park, she’s injected with a paralyzing agent. Though Iris manages to fight off her assailant and make a break for the woods, the drugs gradually take effect until she’s rendered completely immobile — at the mercy of whatever or whoever finds her. Grieving the death of her young son, Iris went to that park at her lowest point. Now, she’ll fight like hell to live.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDon't Move\n\n1h 32m   MA 15+   2024\n\n### Fair Play\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Romantic\n\nAn ambitious power couple fight their way up the corporate ladder, but can their relationship survive?

As you may have guessed from Core’s credentials, Medora Slone (Riley Keough) is convinced wolves are to blame for taking her 6-year-old son, Bailey. Meanwhile, Medora’s husband, Vernon (Alexander Skarsgård), is serving overseas in Iraq until an injury and a missing Bailey bring him home. The police, led by Chief Donald Marium (James Badge Dale), and native villagers, like Vernon’s friend, Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope), get involved in the search and form their own opinions as to what’s going on in their small community. As this grisly and suspense-filled tale unfolds, it becomes increasingly difficult to gauge who’s capable of the more savage behavior — animals or humans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHold the Dark\n\n2h 5m   MA 15+   2018\n\n### Interceptor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Action-drama\n\nNothing creates tension like nuclear weapons.

Working in the command center alongside Lt. Colonel Marshall (Rhys Muldoon), Beaver Baker (Aaron Glenane), and Corporal Rahul Shah (Mayen Mehta), Collins is there when the station is infiltrated by ex-military intelligence soldier Alexander Kessel (Luke Bracey) and his group of baddies. They bring a manifesto to stream online about the failures of the US and instructions for those other bad guys in Alaska to launch the seized warheads immediately. As her country’s last line of defense, Collins has other make-’em-up-as-she-goes plans. There’s also a cameo from Pataky’s real-life husband, Chris Hemsworth, if that’s the kind of thing that gets your heart beating fast.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterceptor\n\n1h 38m   MA 15+   2022\n\n### Leave the World Behind\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Apocalyptic\n\nThere’s no going back to normal in this apocalyptic thriller.

But their vacation bliss is soon interrupted when the homeowner, G.H. Scott (Mahershala Ali), and his daughter, Ruth (Myha’la), arrive in the middle of the night seeking to hunker down in the midst of citywide blackouts in New York City. G.H. believes that the phenomenon might be a sign of something bigger, and the two families must learn to trust each other if they have any hope of surviving.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeave the World Behind\n\n2h 21m   M   2023\n\n### The Occupant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Psychological\n\nThe lengths people will go to for a nice apartment these days ... in the case of Javier Muñoz (Javier Gutiérrez), they’re downright terrifying. Once a big-shot advertising exec, now unemployed, Javier can’t even get an unpaid internship. He’s forced to leave his stunning rich-person abode with wife Marga (Ruth Díaz) and son Dani (Cristian Muñoz) and downsize to a cramped rental unit in a poorer part of Barcelona. Marga tries to soften the blow with the observation, “They’re four walls, Javier. That’s it.” But Javier can’t seem to let his old place (or the lifestyle and social status that came with it) go. After he discovers a spare set of keys in his car, he returns to the apartment, steals some cornflakes, goes to the bathroom, and sees photos of the family living there now — businessman Tomás (Mario Casas) with his wife, Lara (Bruna Cusí), and their daughter, Mónica (Iris Vallés). Javier becomes obsessed with the new occupants, and what starts as stalking quickly turns to scheming. He’ll do anything — anything — to get “his” home back.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Occupant\n\n1h 43m   M   2020\n\n### The Platform\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Sci-fi social commentary\n\nThis is a movie about a very scary buffet. One day, Goreng (Iván Massagué) wakes up in a Vertical Self-Management Center, colloquially known as “The Pit,” which is basically a huge tower with lots and lots of floors. His cellmate, Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor), explains that food is delivered to the inhabitants of each floor via a platform from the top floor down to the bottom floor, pausing for a fixed period of time on each level so folks can eat. But here’s the rub — people on the lower levels can only eat what’s left over from those above them. And anyone caught stowing food? They’re killed. Every month, people are randomly assigned a new level. Even if you’re not paying attention to the capitalism critiques or the case for fair distribution of wealth, this tale of survival is gripping enough to keep your interest. We just suggest you don’t watch it while eating.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Platform\n\n1h 35m   R 18+   2019\n\n### Reptile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Crime\n\nIn this twisty thriller, hardened detective Tom Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is thrown into a murder investigation after a young real estate agent is found dead at one of her listings.

Come for the mystery, stay for Alicia Silverstone’s performance as Tom’s wife, Judy, who is, in some ways, his most trusted partner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReptile\n\n2h 16m   MA 15+   2023\n\n### Rebel Ridge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Crime-action\n\nWhile cycling into the small town of Shelby Springs to bail his cousin out of jail, former Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) is rammed by a police car. The officers behind the wheel unjustly confiscate his bail money, plus extra funds Terry had slotted for a new business venture to help his cousin turn his life around. After arriving in town, meeting aspiring lawyer Summer McBride (AnnaSophia Robb), and attempting to report the robbery, Terry soon realizes the entire force is corrupt — all the way up to Police Chief Burnne (Don Johnson). But this time, they’ve messed with the wrong Marine.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRebel Ridge\n\n2h 11m   MA 15+   2024\n\n### Spiderhead\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThriller subgenre: Psychological sci-fi\n\nSpeaking of drugs, Spiderhead tells the story of inmates Jeff (Miles Teller) and Lizzy (Jurnee Smollett), looking to reduce their sentences by volunteering as test subjects for various mood- and mind-altering chemicals in a fancy-schmancy penitentiary. The prisoners have their own rooms and are free to roam without guard supervision, as long as they show up for their daily test runs of the drugs. These are administered by the likable Steve Abnesti (Chris Hemsworth) and his dutiful assistant, Mark (Mark Paguio).

Well, let’s be more specific. First off, you’re definitely in the mood for a thriller, right? Not a horror situation? (If you want that, head here.) While a thriller can be scary and horror can be thrilling, the difference between the two is right in the name. Horror films are predictably meant to horrify you with some evil that needs to be destroyed or at least escaped. Meanwhile, thrillers are unpredictable, which is part of what builds the tension that’s meant to — you guessed it — thrill you.\n\n## Popular Now\n\n- ExplainerWhy Did Jamie Do It?

There are lots: psychological, mystery, high-stakes operation (think action, crime, legal, political, spy, sci-fi save-the-world stuff). If they’re any good, all thrillers at some point become so heart-racing, so sweat-inducing, so completely captivating that you don’t dare pause them — even though you’ve really had to pee for the last seven minutes. Those are the thrillers worth your time — and worth making this list. So, because it wouldn’t be fair to hold you in suspense, here are some of the best thrillers you can stream right now. (Bladders, be warned.)\n\n### <Name>Bird Box</Name>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<Genre>Thriller subgenre: Postapocalyptic</Genre>\n\nWhen someone tells you, “Don’t look,” fighting the urge becomes almost impossible. But in <Name>Bird Box</Name>, it’s a matter of life or death. Based on a 2014 novel with the same name, this <ReleaseYear>2018</ReleaseYear> film follows Malorie Hayes (Sandra Bullock) on a journey of survival. The world is overrun with off-camera entities that cause anyone who looks at them to commit suicide. We meet Malorie as she’s instructing two children (Vivien Lyra Blair and Julian Edwards) to float down a river blindfolded, but then quickly jump back five years to a pregnant Malorie and her visiting sister (Sarah Paulson). A news broadcast warns that unexplained mass suicides are spreading and things are, ahem, not looking good. As Malorie fights for her life, she encounters friends and enemies — including Tom (Trevante Rhodes), Olympia (Danielle Macdonald), Greg (BD Wong), Douglas (John Malkovich), Lucy (Rosa Salazar), and Felix (Machine Gun Kelly). And while none of them are supposed to open their eyes in the monsters’ presence, you won’t be able to look away.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<Name>Bird Box</Name>\n\n<ReleaseYear>2018</ReleaseYear> <PlotComplexity>2h 4m</PlotComplexity> <IntellectualThemes>MA 15+</IntellectualThemes>\n\n### <Name>The Call</Name>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<Genre>Thriller subgenre: Sci-fi mystery</Genre>\n\nSeo-yeon (Park Shin-hye) returns to her childhood home on her way to visit her sick and estranged mother.

But soon after, an earbud comes through in a screening bin and a mysterious text instructs Ethan to insert it.

Meanwhile, Medora’s husband, Vernon (Alexander Skarsgård), is serving overseas in Iraq until an injury and a missing Bailey bring him home.

After she files a sexual misconduct report and becomes the subject of even more harassment from her military peers because of it, Army Captain JJ Collins (Elsa Pataky) is re-stationed to the middle of the Pacific Ocean at the only other US interceptor missile launch site. Working in the command center alongside Lt.

Once a big-shot advertising exec, now unemployed, Javier can’t even get an unpaid internship. He’s forced to leave his stunning rich-person abode with wife Marga (Ruth Díaz) and son Dani (Cristian Muñoz) and downsize to a cramped rental unit in a poorer part of Barcelona. Marga tries to soften the blow with the observation, “They’re four walls, Javier. That’s it.” But Javier can’t seem to let his old place (or the lifestyle and social status that came with it) go. After he discovers a spare set of keys in his car, he returns to the apartment, steals some cornflakes, goes to the bathroom, and sees photos of the family living there now — businessman Tomás (Mario Casas) with his wife, Lara (Bruna Cusí), and their daughter, Mónica (Iris Vallés). Javier becomes obsessed with the new occupants, and what starts as stalking quickly turns to scheming.

One day, Goreng (Iván Massagué) wakes up in a Vertical Self-Management Center, colloquially known as “The Pit,” which is basically a huge tower with lots and lots of floors. His cellmate, Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor), explains that food is delivered to the inhabitants of each floor via a platform from the top floor down to the bottom floor, pausing for a fixed period of time on each level so folks can eat. But here’s the rub — people on the lower levels can only eat what’s left over from those above them. And anyone caught stowing food? They’re killed. Every month, people are randomly assigned a new level. Even if you’re not paying attention to the capitalism critiques or the case for fair distribution of wealth, this tale of survival is gripping enough to keep your interest. We just suggest you don’t watch it while eating.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<Name>The Platform</Name>\n\n<ReleaseYear>2019</ReleaseYear> <PlotComplexity>1h 35m</PlotComplexity> <IntellectualThemes>R 18+</IntellectualThemes>\n\n### <Name>Reptile</Name>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<Genre>Thriller subgenre: Crime</Genre>\n\nIn this twisty thriller, hardened detective Tom Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is thrown into a murder investigation after a young real estate agent is found dead at one of her listings.

I rank this list based on how well the movie represents the crime investigation genre over other genres.\n\nThe “Detective Film” is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction and can be defined as a film that focuses on a detective-hero’s investigation into the mystery surrounding a crime. For a film to belong to the detective genre, it requires two features: a narrative that follows an investigation, and a protagonist that functions as a detective-figure (police detective, private-eye, amateur, lawyer, journalist). The detective-figure studies the intriguing reasons and events leading to the crime, and eventually determines the identity of the villain (a murderer, a master spy, an arch fiend, an unseen evil, or a malignant psychological force). The central character usually explores the unsolved crime, unmasks the perpetrator, and puts an end to the effects of the villainy.\n\n: crime mystery (murder, disappearance, kidnapping, fraud, scandal), investigation, law, justice, and punishment, the “whodunit” aspect, unraveled crimes in court, detective-story format to the spy plot, investigative journalism.\n\ndetective fiction movies:\n\n- The Maltese Falcon (1941)\n- The Big Sleep (1946)\n- Vertigo (1958)\n- Chinatown (1974)\n- Murder On The Orient Express (1974)\n\nList activity\n\nCreate a new list\n\nList your movie, TV &amp; celebrity picks.\n\n- 165 titles\n\n- 1.

The detective-figure studies the intriguing reasons and events leading to the crime, and eventually determines the identity of the villain (a murderer, a master spy, an arch fiend, an unseen evil, or a malignant psychological force). The central character usually explores the unsolved crime, unmasks the perpetrator, and puts an end to the effects of the villainy.</p>\n        <p>Detective fiction movies:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>\n                <movieRecommendation>\n                    <name>The Maltese Falcon</name>\n                    <releaseYear>1941</releaseYear>\n                    <director>John Huston</director>\n                    <genre>Crime, Mystery, Thriller</genre>\n                    <additionalInformation>{\"description\": \"San Francisco private detective Sam Spade takes on a case that involves him with three eccentric criminals, a gorgeous liar and their quest for a priceless statuette, with the stakes rising after his partner is murdered.\"}</additionalInformation>\n                </movieRecommendation>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <movieRecommendation>\n                    <name>The Big Sleep</name>\n                    <releaseYear>1946</releaseYear>\n                    <director>Howard Hawks</director>\n                    <genre>Crime, Mystery, Thriller</genre>\n                    <additionalInformation>{\"description\": \"A private detective is hired to solve a case involving a wealthy family and a series of murders.\"}</additionalInformation>\n                </movieRecommendation>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <movieRecommendation>\n                    <name>Vertigo</name>\n                    <releaseYear>1958</releaseYear>\n                    <director>Alfred Hitchcock</director>\n                    <genre>Drama, Mystery, Thriller</genre>\n                    <additionalInformation>{\"description\": \"A former San Francisco police detective juggles wrestling with his personal demons and becoming obsessed with the hauntingly beautiful woman he has been hired to trail.\"}</additionalInformation>\n                </movieRecommendation>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <movieRecommendation>\n                    <name>Chinatown</name>\n                    <releaseYear>1974</releaseYear>\n                    <director>Roman Polanski</director>\n                    <genre>Drama, Mystery, Thriller</genre>\n                    <additionalInformation>{\"description\": \"A private detective hired to expose an adulterer in 1930s Los Angeles finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, corruption, and murder.\"}</additionalInformation>\n                </movieRecommendation>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n                <movieRecommendation>\n                    <name>Murder On The Orient Express</name>\n                    <releaseYear>1974</releaseYear>\n                    <director>Sidney Lumet</director>\n                    <genre>Drama, Crime, Mystery</genre>\n                    <additionalInformation>{\"description\": \"In December 1935, when his transcontinental luxury train is stranded by deep snow, detective Hercule Poirot is called on to solve a murder that occurred in his car the night before.\"}</additionalInformation>\n                </movieRecommendation>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\n### Explanation\n- Each movie is wrapped in a `<movieRecommendation>` tag, which contains the required `<name>` and `<additionalInformation>` tags, as well as optional tags for `<releaseYear>`, `<director>`, and `<genre>`.\n- The article has been structured to maintain readability while clearly delineating the relevant information using XML tags as specified in the ADT.",

                "Plot": "Carrying out orders, inexperienced hitman Ray shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a young boy standing behind him. He and his mentor Ken are sent to hide in Bruges by their boss Harry, where they are to sightsee and await further instruction. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chloë, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple over smoking indoors and punches them. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the small-time criminal and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chloë admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chloë drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chloë's stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites. Harry calls Ken and reveals that the trip was an attempt to give Ray a good experience before he dies. He orders Ken to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken phones Harry to tell him the truth, and Harry immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun and a box of dumdum bullets at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention. Ray's train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chloë bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Meanwhile, Harry spots Ken at a café. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Meanwhile, Eirik crosses the market square and sees Ray and Chloë on a date. He rushes up the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the stairs. Ken tries to disarm Harry, but he is mortally shot in the neck as Harry rushes to the square. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower, and accepts he must jump to save Ray. The warning works, and Ken warns Ray with his dying breath, but his gun is broken during the fall, forcing Ray back to the hotel to retrieve his own. Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray jumps onto a passing barge, but loses Eirik's gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray stumbles into the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray with the dumdum bullets. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried through the movie set and watches the other characters pass by (Chloë, Marie and Eirik) as he is loaded into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die. His fate is left ambiguous.",

I glossed over it in the past because it was known as his weakest movie, and only decided to watch it days ago. WHAT. THE. HELL. I wrote that for two reasons. One: this is a fantastic movie with great performances, an eerie score and hauntingly beautiful imagery. Two: It has to be the most confusing film I have ever seen, and that is a hard bar to surpass considering what my brain has witnessed. Enemy is almost like if Only God Forgives focused less on violence and more on interesting characters while providing all the necessary visual storytelling. It combines both scarring visuals with a narrative that’s too rarely seen in cinema. Despite not being his greatest movie, it certainly is not his worst, and I’d even go as far as to call it a masterpiece. Then again, basically all of Denis Villeneuve’s films are. This film is too much for just a simple review, and calls for an in-depth analysis."

Great literature seldom makes for great cinema. The mediums are vastly different. However great literature, in the right hands, can make for very entertaining cinema. Such is the case with Guy Ritchie's interpretation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest character.\n\nMr. Ritchie provides us with quite a departure from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce \"Holmes and Watson\". Here we get dazzling special effects and near super-human feats and stunts. Another twist is that this Holmes here is no meticulous, fastidious bore in real life. In fact, he lives more like a frat boy or rock star - replete with trashed room and bouts of isolation.\n\nWhat is not missing is Holmes' world class attention to detail. The story here is multi-layered and actually very interesting, if not a bit high-minded and high-concept. The still-under-construction Tower Bridge plays a role in the film and the bleakness and gray of London is captured perfectly.\n\nOf course, I won't reveal any details of the story other than to say the \"good\" guys are out to get a real bad guy here ... wonderfully played by the always solid Mark Strong, who may or may not be dead. That always makes for an interesting case! Support from Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan are fine, but Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are the real stars as Holmes and Watson. As odd as it seems, they really do have a buddy factor that works well on screen. Downey's physicality has always set him apart from many contemporary actors ... he moves like a dancer and fights like a champion. Jude Law is often too pretty-boy for me, but he really does a nice job of capturing the reluctant sidekick with complimentary skills.\n\nThis is a BIG movie! It is made to be a rollicking good time with tons of popcorn munched. Smaller kids will not be able to follow the story, but anyone who has read a Holmes story (and isn't against a little artistic license) should see the film.

The film is directed by Guy Ritchie and produced by Dan Lin, Joel Silver, Lionel Wigram and Susan Downey.[4]\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Kieran Mulroney and Michele Mulroney. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively, alongside Noomi Rapace as Madame Simza \"Sim\" Heron, Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Kelly Reilly as Mary Morstan, Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade, William Houston as Constable Clark and Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler. Although the film follows an original premise, it incorporates more closely elements of Conan Doyle's short stories, including \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Adventure of the Empty House\".[5] In the film, Holmes and Watson travel across Europe with a Romani fortune-teller to foil an intricate plot by the cunning Professor Moriarty to instigate a major European conflict.\n\nThough the film received predominantly mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and the performances of Downey, Law, and Harris, criticism over the poor use of its supporting cast, particularly McAdams, it was commercially successful, with a worldwide gross of over $543 million. A third film to be directed by Dexter Fletcher is currently in development hell.[6]\n\n## Plot\n\nShortly after the events of the first movie, Irene Adler delivers a package to Dr. Hoffmanstahl, his payment for completing a recent surgery, while he hands her a letter. Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a bomb. Sherlock Holmes takes the letter and places the bomb in a sarcophagus to explode, while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape.\n\nHoffmanstahl is subsequently assassinated, while Moriarty, deeming Adler compromised, poisons and kills her. Holmes discloses to Dr. John Watson at 221B Baker Street that he has connected seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks, and business acquisitions to Moriarty.\n\nAfter meeting with his brother Mycroft at Watson's bachelor party, Holmes meets with Romani fortune-teller Madame Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother René. He defeats an assassin sent to kill her and she departs.\n\nAfter the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Moriarty taunts him about murdering Adler and indicates he will kill Watson and Mary due to Holmes' interference. So, Holmes vows to defeat him.\n\nMoriarty's men ambush Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon in Brighton. Holmes throws Mary from the train into a river, and she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty's men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris and locate Simza. Holmes tells her she has been targeted because René is working for Moriarty and may have told her his plans.\n\nSimza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and René belonged; the anarchists have been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty. The trio follows Holmes' deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, the bomb is in a nearby hotel; its explosion kills several businessmen.\n\nThe bomb was a cover for the assassination of Alfred Meinhard by Sebastian Moran, expert sharpshooter and henchman to Professor Moriarty. His death grants Moriarty ownership of Meinhard's arms factory in Heilbronn.\n\nThe trio follows Moriarty to Germany. At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and tortures Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty's plot, revealing that the Professor acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies and intends to instigate a major world war to make himself a fortune.\n\nWatson uses a cannon to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed. The structure collapses into the warehouse where Moriarty is holding Holmes captive. Watson, Simza, and Holmes escape and Holmes deduces that Moriarty's final target will be a peace summit in Switzerland, creating an international incident. At the summit, Holmes deduces that René is the assassin and is disguised as one of the ambassadors, having been given radical reconstructive surgery by Hoffmanstahl.\n\nHolmes and Moriarty meet on a balcony to discuss their plans over a game of chess. Watson and Simza stop René's assassination attempt; René is killed by Moran, who flees. Despite his war being averted, Moriarty remains confident in his victory, predicting to Holmes that the nations of Europe will inevitably go to war with one another regardless of Moriarty's manipulations.\n\nHolmes reveals that, while being tortured by Moriarty, he replaced the professor's personal diary that contained his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary, who decrypted the code using a book Holmes had noticed in Moriarty's office, before passing the information to Inspector Lestrade, who seizes Moriarty's assets and donates his fortune to charities that help war widows and orphans.\n\nHolmes and Moriarty anticipate a fight, and both realise that Moriarty will win due to Holmes' injured shoulder. Out of options and with Moriarty vowing to kill Watson and Mary, Holmes grabs him and drags him over the balcony, just as Watson shows up, and the two fall into the Reichenbach Falls below, to their deaths.\n\nFollowing Holmes's funeral, Watson and Mary prepare to have their belated honeymoon when Watson receives a package containing a breathing device of Mycroft's that Holmes expressed a liking for before the summit. Realising that Holmes may have survived, Watson leaves his office to ask Mary about the delivery man. Holmes, having concealed himself in Watson's office, reads Watson's memoirs on the typewriter and adds a question mark after the words \"The End\".\n\n## Cast\n\n- Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes\n- Jude Law as Dr. John Watson\n- Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty, a criminal mastermind serving under the guise of a mathematics professor.\n- Noomi Rapace as Madame Simza \"Sim\" Heron\n- Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes\n- Kelly Reilly as Mary Morstan\n- Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler\n- Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade\n- Paul Anderson as Sebastian Moran\n- Geraldine James as Mrs. Hudson\n- Thierry Neuvic as Claude Ravache\n- Fatima Adoum as a Manouche\n- Wolf Kahler as Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

It's not a lead part.\"[8] Warner Bros. later confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that McAdams would play a part in the sequel but that it would be a cameo appearance.[9] The female lead role was played by Noomi Rapace. Joel Silver, the film's producer, has said that \"we always intended to have a different kind of girl for each movie\" in the vein of Bond girls.[10] He found it \"complicated\" to persuade McAdams to return in a smaller role: \"She loved being with us, but she hoped to have a bigger role. I think at the end of the day it worked out fine.\"[10] The death of Adler in the film left many fans speculating her character faked her demise.[11]\n\nThe film, then under the working title of Sherlock Holmes 2, was reported to be influenced by Conan Doyle's \"The Final Problem\".[5] While the film took place a year after the events of the first film,[5] Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was intended to be a stand-alone film that did not require knowledge of the previous movie.[5]\n\nIn October 2010, the steamship PS Waverley was chartered on the English Channel for filming, and a large green screen was erected at Didcot Railway Centre, where a large action scene was filmed the following month.[12] In late November, a scene was filmed at Victoria Bridge in Worcestershire, England. In January 2011, scenes were also filmed at Hampton Court Palace and areas in Oxford University.[13]\n\nIn early February 2011, principal photography moved for two days to Strasbourg, France. Shooting took place on, around, and inside Strasbourg Cathedral. The scene was said at the time to be the opening scene of the film, as it covered an assassination and bombing in a German-speaking town.[14]\n\nThe production also filmed at several locations in Kent including Fort Amherst, Knole and The Historic Dockyard Chatham.[15] The White Cliffs of Dover are also briefly featured in the movie, as is the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. Several scenes were also filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire.[16][17][18]\n\n### Music\n\nHans Zimmer composed the film's score. In addition to featuring existing works by Johann Strauss II, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ennio Morricone, and Franz Schubert, Zimmer included elements from authentic Romani music. Zimmer, accompanied by director Guy Ritchie and some of Zimmer's musicians, traveled to France, Italy, and Slovakia to research the local music firsthand and to \"listen to as many musicians as we could.\" Deeply impressed, Zimmer arranged for 13 of the local musicians — with their personal violins and accordions — to join him in Vienna at a studio for a recording session. Zimmer incorporated this Romani music into the score for the film. It was reported a portion of proceeds from the soundtrack would be given to the impoverished Romani villages to help pay for necessities, such as water and heat.[19][20]\n\n## Release\n\nJude Law in January 2012 at the film's French premiere in Paris\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows was released on 16 December 2011 in Canada, Mexico, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom; on 25 December 2011 in most other countries; and on 5 January 2012 in Australia, Poland, and Spain.[21]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 12 June 2012 for Region 1[22][23] and 14 May 2012 for Region 2[24][25] and Region 4.[26]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows earned $186.8 million in North America as well as $357 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $543.4 million.[3] It was the 12th-highest-grossing film of 2011 worldwide.[27]\n\nIn North America, it topped the box office on its opening day with $14.6 million,[28][29] down from the opening-day gross of the previous film, $24.6 million.[30] During the weekend, it grossed $39.6 million, leading the box office but earning approximately two-thirds as much as its predecessor on its opening weekend.[31] By the end of its theatrical run, it became the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2011 in the US.[27]\n\nOutside North America, the film earned $14.6 million on its opening weekend, finishing in third place.[32] It topped the overseas box office during three consecutive weekends in January 2012.[33][34][35] It eventually surpassed its predecessor's foreign total of $315 million. In the UK, Ireland and Malta, its highest-grossing market after North America, the film achieved a first-place opening of £3.83 million[36] ($5.95 million)[37] over a three-day period, compared to the £3.08 million earned in two days by the original film.[38] It earned $42.2 million in total in this market. In the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Italy, the film earned $28.4 million and $24.5 million, respectively.[39]\n\n### Critical response\n\nSome critics felt that Rachel McAdams (pictured), Noomi Rapace, Kelly Reilly and Stephen Fry had been underused.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 60% based on 230 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a good yarn thanks to its well-matched leading men but overall stumbles duplicating the well-oiled thrills of the original.\"[40] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, gives the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[41] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, higher than the previous film's \"B\".[42]\n\nRoger Ebert, who gave the first film three stars, was even more positive in his review for the sequel, awarding it three-and-a-half stars and calling it \"high-caliber entertainment\" that \"add[s] a degree of refinement and invention\" to the formula. He also said the writers \"wisely devote some of their best scenes to one-on-ones between Holmes and Moriarty.\"[43] Xan Brooks of The Guardian gave the film four out of five stars.[44] James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"A Game of Shadows is a stronger, better-realized movie that builds upon the strengths of the original and jettisons some of the weaknesses.\"[45] Conversely, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club felt the film \"aims lower than its predecessor's modest ambition and still misses the mark.\"[46] Empire film critic Ian Nathan gave the film three out of five stars, and although critical of Sim, called the sequel overall \"bigger, better, funnier\".[47]\n\nSeveral critics felt that McAdams was underused. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt \"she vanishes all too soon in this overproduced, self-enchanted sequel, and so does the spirit of bright invention that made the previous film such a pleasant surprise.\"[48] Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post remarked that she \"exhibits far more personality and roguish charm in her few moments here than she did in all of the previous film. Freed from the constraints of being the de-facto love interest, McAdams relishes the chance to go full-villain.\"[49] Charlotte Skeoch was critical, not just of McAdams' cameo, but of Reilly's and Rapace's roles, especially with the former, even panning Sim's characterisation. She also criticised Fry's small role and gave the film a mixed review.[50]\n\nEmmet Asher-Perrin of Tor.com said \"I was sort of thrilled that Irene Adler was taken out of the picture so quickly. While I didn't mind the position the character occupied in the narrative of the last movie, Rachel McAdams' Adler never meshed well with this particular Holmes. The near-paternal tint in his affection for her was bothersome, and not missed this time around\".[51] A. O. Scott of the New York Times was critical of the lack of Marsan.[52]\n\nRachel Bowles was critical of Rapace and Fry, feeling that the Mycroft \"scenes contain more gratuitous gags that don’t really do Fry’s brand of intelligent and subtle humour justice.\"[53]\n\nIn 2015, film critic Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com included A Game of Shadows in his video series \"The Unloved\", where he highlights films which received mixed to negative reviews yet he believes to have artistic value. He praised the film's deconstruction of action scenes through stylistic editing, one inspired by Soviet montage which was exemplified in Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 film Battleship Potemkin, as well as the friendship and constant banter between Holmes and Watson at the center of the film, which \"highlight[s] the difficulty in achieving lyrical deftness of dialogue in films of this budget\", with their friendship reminding Tafoya of how \"we can invite danger and fun into our lives in equal measure all the time, but once in a blue moon, they make life worth living.\"[54] Tafoya considers A Game of Shadows to be his eighth-favourite film of the 21st century.[55]\n\n### Accolades\n\n|   Year  | Award                         | Category                                                          | Recipients                                               | Result    | Ref.    |\n|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|   2012  | Saturn Awards                 | Best Action/Adventure Film                                        | Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows                       | Nominated | [56]    |\n|   2012  | Saturn Awards                 | Best Costume                                                      | Jenny Beavan                                             | Nominated | [56]    |\n|   2012  | Teen Choice Awards            | Choice Movie: Action                                              | Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows                       | Nominated | [57]    |\n|   2012  | Teen Choice Awards            | Choice Movie Actor: Action                                        | Robert Downey Jr.                                        | Nominated | [57]    |\n|   2012  | Teen Choice Awards            | Choice Movie Actress: Action                                      | Noomi Rapace                                             | Nominated | [57]    |\n|   2012  | Visual Effects Society Awards | Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture | Laya Armian, Chas Jarrett, Seth Maury, Sirio Quintavalle | Nominated | [58]    |\n\n## Future\n\n### Sequel\n\nIn 2011, Warner Bros. Pictures announced the first draft for Sherlock Holmes 3 was being written by screenwriter Drew Pearce;[59] he was later replaced by Justin Haythe.[60] Jude Law commented on the project in late 2013, saying, \"We had a meeting earlier this year, the three of us, and I think it's being written now. Warner Bros. have still got to agree to pay for it... I think they want to!\"[61] He added, \"It's a slow process. We're all busy. So getting us together to try to nail that has taken a little bit longer than we had hoped.\"[62] In 2014, Susan Downey stated that a third film was in development: \"There's an idea, there's an outline, there is not a script yet. Trust me, the studio would love there to be a script. But our feeling is, we gotta get it right.\"[63]\n\nProducer Lionel Wigram said in 2015 that both Downey Jr. and Law would reprise their roles from the first two films.[64] In 2016, Downey claimed the film would begin shooting later in the year,[65] but the same month, it was revealed that James Coyne was hired to rewrite the script.[66] After more delays, Wigram later speculated in 2017 that the film would begin shooting in 2018.[67] Warner Bros. stated in 2018 that the third film was scheduled for release on December 25, 2020, with Downey, Law and Anderson reprising their roles and Chris Brancato writing the script.[68]\n\nIn 2019, the release date was pushed to December 22, 2021,[69] and it was announced that Ritchie would be replaced by Dexter Fletcher as the film's director.[70] The film was approved for a $20.9 million tax break by the California Film Commission in May 2019, against a projected production budget of $107.8 million.[71]\n\nFletcher said in 2021 that the film was delayed indefinitely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, stating, \"We started going and then Covid hit, and they were like, 'Look we're going to stand it down and Robert has got something else he wants to do'...These things are so big that you don't wanna just chisel them into something... I know that Robert will not let that fish off the hook.\"[72][73] In 2023, Fletcher said that he, Downey, and writer Joe Penhall were working on the script in Downey's home, reiterating that the pandemic affected development and their personal plans, schedules, and priorities in terms of projects.[74] Susan Downey and Team Downey collaborator Amanda Burrell later confirmed that the project was still a priority for the company and for Downey.[75]\n\n### Franchise\n\nBy October 2020, Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey announced plans to expand the film series into a franchise. Team Downey is working on installments including additional films, spin-offs, television series for HBO Max, and other media in a shared universe. Though they do not intend to copy the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the pair acknowledged that they felt that working with Marvel Studios taught them much with regards to world-building.[76] Two television series set in the films' universe are in development for HBO Max.[77]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (12A)\".

Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a bomb. Sherlock Holmes takes the letter and places the bomb in a sarcophagus to explode, while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape.\n        </Summary>\n        <Details>\n            Hoffmanstahl is subsequently assassinated, while Moriarty, deeming Adler compromised, poisons and kills her.

Holmes tells her she has been targeted because René is working for Moriarty and may have told her his plans.\n        </Climax>\n        <Resolution>\n            Holmes reveals that, while being tortured by Moriarty, he replaced the professor's personal diary that contained his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary, who decrypted the code using a book Holmes had noticed in Moriarty's office, before passing the information to Inspector Lestrade, who seizes Moriarty's assets and donates his fortune to charities that help war widows and orphans.\n        </Resolution>\n    </Plot>\n\n    <Reception>\n        <BoxOffice>\n            <TotalGross>$543.8 million</TotalGross>\n        </BoxOffice>\n        <CriticalResponse>\n            The film received predominantly mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and the performances of Downey, Law, and Harris, but criticism over the poor use of its supporting cast, particularly McAdams.\n        </CriticalResponse>\n    </Reception>\n\n    <Future>\n        <Sequel>\n            A third film to be directed by Dexter Fletcher is currently in development.\n        </Sequel>\n    </Future>\n</SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the key attributes are highlighted with the appropriate XML tags.

First, he was best for it. Second, he was the only boy at auditions who wore a tie. Third, director M. Night Shyamalan was surprised when he asked Osment if he read his part. Osment replied, \"I read it three times last night.\" Shyamalan was impressed, saying, \"Wow, you read your part three times?\" To which Osment replied, \"No, I read the script three times.\"\n\n- GoofsCole is aware of his teacher's stuttering issue during grade school through high school (Stuttering Stanley), but the behavior has nothing to do with anyone being dead, so it doesn't make sense that Cole knows this.\n\nThe burn victim woman Cole talks to at the end (when Stanley walks in on him in the dressing room) was presumably a teacher at the school. In the very next scene Stanley says, \"You know, when I was a student here there was a big fire.\" Obviously the burn victim woman (or a different fire victim we don't see) told Cole about Stanley's stuttering problem.\n\n- QuotesCole Sear: I see dead people.Malcolm Crowe: In your dreams?[Cole shakes his head no] Malcolm Crowe: While you're awake?[Cole nods] Malcolm Crowe: Dead people like, in graves? In coffins?Cole Sear: Walking around like regular people. They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.Malcolm Crowe: How often do you see them?Cole Sear: All the time. They're everywhere.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe Spanish phrase \"I don't want to die\" that was played on the tape\nrecorder in Malcolm's office is repeated after the credits.\n\n- Alternate versionsA network TV airing from ABC Family adds in a new scene that was not featured in the DVD as extras\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Thomas Sanders &amp;amp; Friends: Joystick Joyride: Kingdom Hearts 3 Ep. 2: Hercules! Hercules! (2019)\n\n- SoundtracksI Fall In Love Too Easily\nWritten by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne\nPerformed by Chet Baker\nCourtesy of Blue Note Records, a division of Capitol Records, Inc.\nUnder license from EMI-Capitol Music Special Markets\n\n### User reviews2.4K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending\n\nThis was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.\n\nI didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as \"the greatest movie ever\" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.\n\nI enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in \"Unbreakable,\" to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.\n\nOsment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.\n\nThis isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.\n\n- ccthemovieman-1\n- Nov 7, 2006\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ26\n\n- How long is The Sixth Sense?Powered by Alexa\n- Are the pictures of younger Cole on the living room wall actually pictures of Haley Joel Osment when he was younger?\n- Exactly what type of room was Cole locked in?\n- What is 'The Sixth Sense' about?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 7, 1999 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - -Disney+ Hotstar\n    - -Interview with Haley Joel Osment for \"The Sixth Sense\"\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Latin\n    - Spanish\n- Also known as\n    - El sexto sentido\n- Filming locations\n    - Striped Bass - 1500 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA(missed anniversary date restaurant scene)\n- Production companies\n    - Hollywood Pictures\n    - Spyglass Entertainment\n    - The Kennedy/Marshall Company\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $40,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $293,506,292\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $26,681,262\n    - Aug 8, 1999\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $672,806,432\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 47 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - SDDS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being \"Inception\". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found \"Shutter Island\" to be much more superior, as \"Inception\" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.\n\nGood.\n\"Shutter Island\" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many \"illusions\" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from \"Memento\" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.\n\nConclusion.\nOn the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of \"Shutter Island\". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.\n\nRating.\nScore : absolute 10/10\nGrade : A+\n\n- NpMoviez\n- Jul 28, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ14\n\n- What is \"Shutter Island\" about?\n- Is \"Shutter Island\" based on a book?\n- Who is Andrew Laeddis?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - February 18, 2010 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Ebook\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - German\n- Also known as\n    - La isla siniestra\n- Filming locations\n    - Peddocks Island, Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Paramount Pictures\n    - Phoenix Pictures\n    - Sikelia Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $80,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $128,012,934\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $41,062,440\n    - Feb 21, 2010\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $294,972,125\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 18 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - SDDS\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - DTS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's got a twisty plot, interesting characters, and deep themes. Written in 1930, it introduces Sam Spade, a tough detective who gets tangled up with shady folks and their secrets while chasing a mysterious Maltese Falcon statue. This book has stuck around, even getting turned into movies, like the famous 1941 one with Humphrey Bogart. SparkNotes, a popular study guide, breaks down the book for us, helping to see its many layers.  Need a custom essay on the same topic?

Order now\n\nThis essay looks at what SparkNotes says about the plot, characters, and themes to show why the book is such a classic in detective stories.Plot Summary: Unraveling the Mystery\n\nSparkNotes gives us a clear rundown of \"The Maltese Falcon.\" The story kicks off with Sam Spade meeting Brigid O'Shaughnessy. At first, she pretends to be someone else and asks for his help to find her missing sister. But things get messy fast. The case spirals into a confusing mystery with murders, lies, and the hunt for the Maltese Falcon—a valuable statue everyone wants. SparkNotes walks us through all the twists, like Spade's partner Miles Archer getting killed, and introduces characters like Joel Cairo and Casper Gutman. This summary helps readers follow the complicated story and appreciate Hammett's skill in building suspense.Character Analysis: Deconstructing Motives and Moral Ambiguity\n\nOne great thing about SparkNotes is how it digs into the characters. It looks at what drives them and their complicated personalities. Sam Spade, the main guy, is shown as a classic tough detective—cynical and smart, but not always doing the right thing. SparkNotes points out how Spade's actions often blur the lines between good and bad. For example, he wants justice for his partner's death but uses some pretty shady methods. Brigid O'Shaughnessy is another character SparkNotes explores deeply. She's like a classic femme fatale, using lies and manipulation to get what she wants. SparkNotes also looks at Joel Cairo, who's greedy and shady, and Casper Gutman, the mastermind chasing the Maltese Falcon. This character breakdown helps show the moral gray areas that make the story so intriguing.Thematic Exploration: Unveiling Core Themes\n\nSparkNotes also dives into the big themes in \"The Maltese Falcon.\" One major theme is how greed messes people up. Everyone's chasing the Maltese Falcon because they want to get rich, but in the end, it’s just a fake. SparkNotes explains how this theme shows up in the characters' actions and the pointless nature of their quest. Another theme is deception and trust. The story is full of lies and betrayals, making everyone suspicious of each other. SparkNotes also touches on existentialism, suggesting that Spade’s journey is about finding meaning in a messed-up world. By breaking down these themes, SparkNotes helps readers understand the deeper messages in the book.Conclusion\n\nTo wrap it up, SparkNotes is super helpful for anyone trying to get through the complexities of Dashiell Hammett’s \"The Maltese Falcon.\" It offers a detailed plot summary, deep dives into characters, and explores key themes. The plot summary helps keep track of all the story's twists, the character analysis reveals the moral nuances and psychological depth, and the thematic exploration uncovers the big ideas about greed, deception, and finding meaning. All these elements highlight why \"The Maltese Falcon\" is such an important work in detective fiction and why it still matters today. Using SparkNotes, readers can get a better grasp of Hammett's storytelling and the novel's rich, layered nature.\n\nDid you like this example?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n229\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12\n\nThe deadline is too short to read someone else's essay\n\nHire a verified expert to write you a 100% Plagiarism-Free paper\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPapersowl\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSitejabber\n\nReviews.io\n\n## Cite this page\n\nThe Complexity and Significance of \"The Maltese Falcon\".

It's Wonderful!\n\n# Menu\n\n- Home\n- About Me\n- Carry On Blog Series\n- Facebook Groups\n- My Blogathons\n- Some of my Favourite Blogs\n- Support The Wonderful World of Cinema!\n- The Wonderful World of Cinema on Social Medias\n- Three Enchanting Ladies\n- Video Tributes\n\n# A Vertigo Analysis\n\nAbout two years ago, I wrote an analysis of Hitchcock’s Vertigo for school, got a 96% and was very proud of it. Today, I’ve decided to translate it and publish it on my blog so I could share it with you. Of course, this is only my own interpretation of the film and we can all find a different meaning in it. Anyway, I think it’s really one of the most interesting films to analyze. There’s so much to say!\n\nThis article contains many spoilers [in other words, don’t read it if you haven’t seen the film].\n\n***\n\nVertigo is an American movie directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock and it was released in 1958. Even if he was recognized for his talent before, it’s from 1954 that Hitchcock started to be known as “The Master of Suspense”. If the cinema of the 40’s was marked by the golden age of Film Noir, this genre will still be present in the 50’s, but in a less important way. The cinema of the 50’s is mainly marked by some superproductions, especially due of the invention of Cinemascope. This is, sometimes, unprofitable for the studios, due to the expensive cost of these new technologies. Can we talk of Vertigo as a super production? This Technicolor film entirely shot in VistaVision was not a success, nor a commercial failure. As Hitchcock says in his interview with François Truffaut (Hitchcock/Truffaut), the film “couvrira ses frais” (covered its cost. Free translation by the author).\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was born in London on August 13, 1899. During his career as a movie maker, this kind of reserved man directed more than 50 films. Some of them will become quite important in the history of cinema: according to the BFI, The 39 Steps is the fourth best British film of all times; Rear Window is often considered to be his best film; we hesitate between Citizen Kane (Orson Welles) and Vertigo as the best film of all times. However, Psycho and The Birds remain his most well-known ones. Nominated five times at the Oscars for Best Director (Rebecca, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Rear Window, Psycho), Alfred Hitchcock was snubbed by the AMPAS and unfortunately never won one of those golden statuettes. This cold blondes lover die on April 29, 1980.\n\nBefore we’ll explore Vertigo more deeply, let’s now see what it is about. After an incident that happened during a nocturne police chase, Scottie (James Stewart), a policeman subject to acrophobia, retires from the profession. However, a relation, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), has a project for him: follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), who seems to be possessed by her ancestor Carlota Valdes’s spirit. After saving her from drowning, Scottie falls in love with Madeleine. However, she later commits suicide by jumping from a church window (important to notice that Carlotta Valdes had also killed herself). Scottie, aghast, is comforted by the truly good person in this story: his friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). Later, Scottie meets Judy, who shares a troubling resemblance with Madeleine. Becoming fascinated by her, he transforms her as the Madeleine he had once loved so deeply. We later learn that Judy IS Madeleine (or, well, a false Madeleine) and that all this story was created to hide the murder of the real Madeleine (committed by Galvin) in a suicide.\n\nLet’s now explore the notion of aesthetic genre. Vertigo is first known as a film noir. Why? This film takes place in a western city (San Francisco). However, it doesn’t include a Humphrey Bogart look-alike private detective, but a retired policeman. Scottie still remains a very complex and ambiguous character. This is especially due to his acrophobia, which will be an obstacle for him all along the film. Scottie is also ambiguous because of his “behaviour”: even if Gavin is the evil one in the story, do we consider Scottie as a good or bad man? Of course, he is a hero when he saves Madeleine from drowning, but we seize a certain monstrosity in him during the second part of the film, when he reshapes Judy in the image of a dead person.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis film is also considered to be a film noir as it includes a femme fatale. Here, we are talking about Madeleine (or Judy as Madeleine). Judy will only have one signification for the protagonist when she’ll be Madeleine again. The femme fatale causes the loss of the private detective in the film noir. Manipulative, but in love, Judy/Madeleine will provoke Scottie’s emotive loss, but also her own loss (her death). There is also a fantastic and mysterious side in Vertigo due to its ghostly style: Carlota Valdes (a dead one) seems to possess Madeleine’s spirit. When Judy comes out of the bathroom transformed as Madeleine, there is a sort of ghostly halo around her. We’ll come back to that later. Of course, we understand, in the end, that this ghost story was invented by Gavin to enforce a sinisterly diabolic project. However, the illusion of fantastic is given to us during the entire film, even at the end when the nun suddenly appears at the top of the stairs like a ghost.\n\nWhat can we say about the meaning, the sense of Vertigo? If we explore the concrete and real dimension of this film, its sense is, according to me, the failure of manipulations: manipulations with bad intentions that, if we think about it, are finally unworthy if we analyze the film well. First, Gavin and Judy/false-Madeleine manipulate Scottie to conceal the murder of Galvin’s wife (the real Madeleine) with a suicide, but, ultimately, Gavin will have to run away from the country and Judy will finally really die. The other manipulation would be the one proceeded by Scottie on Judy: he recreates on her the image of a dead one, so he can really love her. We can notice that, before Judy becomes Madeleine, Scottie doesn’t really seem to be in love with her. But this will only lead Judy to her loss and Scottie to his. Even after Madeleine’s death, Judy continues to manipulate Scottie by playing the game. Substantially, everybody is wrong in this situation (except Midge, but we’ll come back to her). Those thoughtless manipulations will bring Scottie to his mental loss, Madeleine and Judy to their physical loss and to the loss of confidence in Gavin.\n\n***\n\nTo understand better the meaning of Vertigo, we will now analyse some important elements of the film. We’ll start by analyzing the places. If we begin with Gavin’s office, we can notice that this one has a classic look. The wooden furniture and its order give it an important and prestigious look. If we observe this office in a superficial way, it gives us the following message: Gavin is an ordinary and respected man, and nobody would have any suspicion about him. This allows Gavin to have the perfect image to manipulate Scottie. But the order in this office, that’s the key point: a man who is able to keep is office as clean, would be able to make a clean murder. What I mean by that is that, when Gavin kills his wife, everything is perfectly done. Even Judy writes it in her letter that she will finally never give to Scottie. A perfect murder, until a jewel spoils everything…\n\nErnie’s would be another interesting location to analyze. It is the story’s fetish restaurant. When Scottie first goes there, it’s to observe Madeleine for the first time. We are then only at the beginning of the film and Scottie doesn’t have any doubts about anything. The ambiance seems good, the ladies’ dresses fit with the restaurant’s red tapestry. It’s a very colourful moment. On the other side, when Scottie returns at Ernie’s after Madeleine’s death, the ambiance is much more sad, much more grey. This introduces us to the most dramatic part of the film, the one where everything is revealed.\n\nNext, in the film, Madeleine visits many places to put Scottie on the wrong track: in the flower market, she buys a bouquet that looks like Carlotta Valdes’s one; at the cemetery, she pays a visit to Carlotta’s grave; at the museum, she observes a portrait of Carlotta Valdes; she goes to the hotel and Scottie learns that this hotel was Carlotta’s old house; the Golden Gate and the Spanish mission would be Madeleine’s suicide’s points. Carlotta possesses her and orders her to die. All those places will eventually lead Scottie into a trap and give him the illusion that Madeleine is really possessed by her ancestor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe often see roads in this film. These can represent the path traced in advance for the characters: Scottie will ride on it until he loses his mind and Judy will ride on it until she dies. If Scottie and Judy know how to drive, it’s because they are in perfect control of the car, but there is always a chance for a bad maneuver and an accident. That’s what happens with all those characters’ manipulations.\n\nLet’s conclude this analysis of the places by focusing on Midge’s house. On one hand, her office is quite messy, but, on the other hand, her kitchen is not. If her kitchen is well-organized, it’s because Judy knows how to “cook” her mind. She is the most reasoned one in this story. She is the first one not to believe Madeleine and Carlotta’s story. However, when the time comes to act, she can do it in a reckless way (we can think of the painting scene): that’s why her working place is in a mess.\n\nWe can now analyse some of Vertigo‘s camera shots. During the introduction, we see a close up of a woman’s face, but it’s impossible to say exactly who it is: Madeleine? Judy? Carlotta Valdes? This confusion is the same one in Scottie’s head: Is he really with Madeleine or with Carlotta? Is he with Judy or Madeleine?\n\nAt the museum, we see a close up of Madeleine’s flower bouquet and then of Carlotta’s bouquet; a close-up of Madeleine’s bun and then one of Carlotta’s. Those elements are identical and create an association between Madeleine and Carlotta. The camera accentuates their importance by making close-ups. The situation is the same when we see this close-up of Carlotta’s necklace on Judy’s neck: this object is important because it reveals the truth to Scottie.\n\nWhen Scottie does this “stepladder challenge”, we see him in a low angle shot. This gives him importance and he seems to control the situation. But, not long after, a subjective shot (Scottie’s point of view) shows us a high angle shot of the street. Scottie gets dizzy and collapses. We’ll later see a similar shot in the church at the Spanish mission. Those shots can symbolize Scottie’s fall: by having been manipulated by both Gavin and Judy, but also by having himself manipulated Judy to recreate Madeleine’s image on her.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother significant shot would be the close-up of Madeleine and Scottie’s faces when they are in the car just after he saved her from the waters. They are face to face for the first time. Madeleine is unconscious and Scottie tries to wake her up. This is how a real relation between them starts. This, in a way, will make it easier for Judy to manipulate Scottie, because she will be in direct contact with him, but, in another way, this will become an obstacle for her because she will fall in love with Scottie and vice versa (that wasn’t planned in Gavin’s perfect murder plan).\n\nWe’ll end this part with the last shot. It is a full shot of Scottie coming out of the church’s window and looking down the roof where Judy fell. This shot focuses on the fact that the fear of heights, which has always been a barrier for Scottie, is now gone. This acrophobia was also a form of manipulation because it prevented Scottie to go further. Once more, this manipulation is a failure because Scottie, shaken by the events, manages to defeat it.\n\nWe’ll continue this analysis by mentioning some significant camera movements. One of the most important in Vertigo is the dolly zoom (also known as “Vertigo effect”), this movement where we have the feeling that the image moves away and gets closer at the same time. In the film, it is used to express Scottie’s giddiness. Just like gags in burlesque comedies, those movements are included in the film in a way to stop the story. Once more, we’re back to the idea of Scottie being manipulated by his dizziness. It first prevents him to climb on the footstool, but, more dramatically, to save Madeleine, the REAL Madeleine.\n\nAnother interesting camera movement happens when Scottie kisses “for the first” time Judy transformed as Madeleine under his desires. We could describe this movement as a “rotational traveling”. Indeed, Scottie kisses Judy, and the camera revolves around them, and then a new setting appears (the stable at the mission where Madeleine gave the clue to Scottie that she was going to kill herself). This camera shot, mixed with the music, adds a lot of deep emotions to the situation. Couldn’t this rotation also symbolise the turning point in those characters’ lives? It is, indeed, not a long time after this scene, that Scottie sees Carlotta’s famous necklace on Judy’s neck. It is also an emotional turn because Scottie wasn’t in love with Judy, but with Madeleine.\n\nLet’s continue with some interesting lightnings used in Vertigo. The lighting in this film adds a lot of meaning, a lot of signification to the situation. Here are some examples: when Scottie goes to the cemetery, the natural light seems fuzzy, foggy and ghostly. The same lighting is used in a more important way when Judy comes out of the bathroom completely transformed as Madeleine. From Scottie’s perspective, she comes from the dead. At the cemetery, this fuzzy lighting adds some mystery to Madeleine, who seems to be more and more unreal, possessed by a ghost. This is, once more, a manipulation tool, because this lighting gives a false illusion about Madeleine’s (or Judy) real identity. It doesn’t only fool Scottie, but also the spectators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the film’s introduction, the lighting is sort of red, and that’s also the case in Scottie’s dream. What does it mean? Red is the color of love, but in Vertigo‘s case, it can be more deeply associated with “passion”: the crazy love passion Scottie has for Madeleine. This color also symbolizes the present. This is a clue concerning the conspiracy (Madeleine is not really possessed by Carlotta), but it also is a way to warn for Scottie: wouldn’t that be better if he’ll learn to live in the present time? It’s by being haunted by his past that he’ll get mad and take possession of Judy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe music would be another interesting element to explore. This one was brilliantly composed by Hitchcock’s fetish composer: Bernard Herrmann. The music is mainly here to point out the film’s atmosphere: the one felt by Scottie, but also the one felt by us. What we generally hear in this film is a mysterious and worrisome music, proper to Hitchcockian cinema. This one is here to accentuate the suspense in the situation. What will happen to Madeleine? How will all this end? This music takes more importance when Scottie follows Madeleine to those diverse places associated to Carlotta Valdes (the cemetery, the museum, the flower market, etc.). During the more dramatic moments, the music becomes more vigorous and more orchestral. We can think of Madeleine’s suicide attempt (next to the Golden Gate), to the chase in the church’s stairs, to the kiss next to the rough sea, etc. Finally, let’s remember that Scottie doesn’t like music or, at least, classical music. A the beginning of the film, when he is at Midge’s place, he asks her to stop the music. After Madeleine’s death, the doctor suggests him to start music-therapy, but, according to Midge, this doesn’t really seem to work. After leaving all these great emotions, Scottie probably needs some silent peace.\n\nLet’s continue with some elements/items that are important to make us understand the sense of Vertigo. First of all, the color green appears many times in the film: Madeleine’s green dress, Judy’s green clothes, the green neons in the Empire Hotel, the green tapestry in the hotel, etc. Even if it is a calming color, green can be associated to death, to the mildew (that’s what happen to a dead body after a certain time): Madeleine is possessed by a dead lady. Green is also a symbol of infidelity: Gavin’s infidelity towards his wife, but also towards Scottie; Scottie’s infidelity towards himself (will he be happy with Madeleine? Is he doing the right thing by recreating Madeleine’s image on Judy?). Green confuses the situations.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThen, many items and situations make us do a connection with the notion of death, which is one of the main themes of Vertigo. We can think of those mortuary items having purposes of falseness (the objects associated to Carlotta): the grave, the bouquet, the necklace, Madeleine’s suicide attempt, Madeleine’s dream, etc. We can also associate this notion of death to something that haunts Scottie and the film’s atmosphere: Scottie’s dream, Judy’s black dress at the end of the film (black is a symbol of death), the church at the mission, the nun who looks like a ghost, Scottie’s necrophilia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother element that is proper to many of Hitchcock’s films (Psycho, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Shadow of a Doubt) are the stairs. In Vertigo, those stairs are an obstacle for Scottie. Scottie’s dizziness created by the church’s stairs prevents him to reach his goal. Gavin then takes the occasion to kill the real Madeleine without being seen (only by Judy).\n\nFinally, two objects give us the truth about Gavin’s diabolic conspiracy: first, Judy’s letter, which only she and the spectators know the existence of (we then wonder what will be Scottie’s reaction) and Carlotta’s necklace (that Judy will imprudently wear). It’s this last element that will reveal the truth to Scottie. So, Scottie understands that he has been manipulated, but the spectators also were, because, during the entire film, we thought Madeleine was really possessed, just like Scottie thought so.\n\nWe’ll conclude this part by analyzing the characters and their importance in the story. John “Scottie” Ferguson is the protagonist. He suffers from vertigo (here, the title “Vertigo” becomes isotopic), but he also suffers from a big naivety. It’s because of those two elements that he will be a victim of Gavin’s setup. After Madeleine’s death, Scottie becomes sort of necrophile and, a manipulator too, if we consider his influence on Judy. Scottie succeeds to control his dizziness at the end of the film when he climbs all the stairs in the church. We could associate Scottie to the color blue (blue eyes, blue pyjamas, blue car…). This color is a symbol of fidelity. Scottie, faithful to his feelings for Madeleine, will resurrect her. He is also loyal to his desire to overcome his acrophobia and will succeed at the end of the film.\n\nAs she writes in her letter, Judy Barton (or the false Madeleine) is the tool in Gavin’s plan. She’s the one who will lead Scottie in a world of deceits: she manipulates him, especially when she pretends that she didn’t go to certain places during her day. We can notice that the brunette Judy often looks at herself in a mirror. What does it mean? Maybe she’s trying to find her real identity, this identity she’s losing by playing a role. Those last moments of observation happen before she takes Madeleine’s appearance one more time (for Scottie): Judy will die as Madeleine. The real Judy is forgotten at the end of the film, especially by Scottie.\n\nIn this story, Marjorie Wood (Midge), an underclothes designer, is the only truly good person. She’s a friend and a confidante for Scottie, but also a mother. Many clues in the film give us this impression, first by this quote: “It’s a brassiere! You know about those things, you’re a big boy now.” when Scottie observes the aeronautical bra. She talks to him just like a mother talks to her little boy to teach him new things. She’s the only character who really takes care about Scottie and who know him well. For example, after Madeleine’s death, the doctor suggests him to do music-therapy, but Midge knows it won’t work because Scottie is not really a music lover. Finally, she’s the only character who doesn’t manipulate another one and, as a result, she’s the only character who remains rational in this situation.\n\nLastly, Gavin Elster is the ultimate manipulator in this story. He gives a false impression of friendship to Scottie, a false impression of being a man we can trust. Gavin is a shipbuilder and we can make a connection with his evil project: build, with Judy, a lie that Scottie’s naivety will unfortunately believe.\n\n***\n\nSooner in the text, I mentioned that Vertigo was generally associated with the film noir genre, but that it also included a part of fantastic. How does that contribute to the atmosphere and the film’s meaning? Let’s start with the film noir dimension. This one adds tension to the film, particularly in the relations between the characters. As for the meaning of the film (the failure of manipulations), this film noir dimension is much more evident in the second part of the film, after Madeleine’s death, when the spectator understands that the “femme fatale” (Judy or “false Madeleine”) will provoke the loss of a policeman (Scottie) by manipulating him. We also discover a certain ambiguity concerning Scottie, especially when he’s trying to recreate Madeleine’s image on Judy. Is he good or bad? Well, he is, for sure, a victim. Concerning the fantastic dimension of Vertigo (or we should say this “illusion of fantastic”), this one creates an atmosphere of confusion and anxiety. Carlotta Valdes’s story grabs our attention and we want to know what will happen to Madeleine/Judy, but also to Scottie. Of course, this illusion is created by Gavin and Judy, who create a FALSE impression of madness around Madeleine, which provokes Scottie’s REAL madness.\n\n***\n\nWe will continue this Vertigo analysis by understanding how the film is presented to us. Here, the objective of this film is not only to show us something in a static way, but also to tell us a story, thanks to a variety of camera movements and camera shots. It’s an ideological editing that contributes to the evolution of the story and its characters. For instance, after Madeleine has run away to the church, it’s with the help of only three camera shots that we understand that she’s about to kill herself: a long shot of Madeleine running to the church, a low angle shot of the bell tower (where she will kill herself) and a medium close-up of a terrified Scottie looking at the bell tower. The offscreen dimension becomes important here.\n\n***\n\nFinally, what can we say about Vertigo‘s narrator? The film is mainly seen from Scottie’s point of view. Many subjective camera shots make us understand that: the subjective shots of Scottie following Madeleine in his car, the shot of Madeleine’s dead body on the church’s roof (we previously saw Scottie looking at the window, so we know he’s the one looking at her), a close-up of Carlotta’s necklace in Judy’s neck (that’s when Scottie understands the real meaning of this adventure), the Vertigo zooms expressing Scottie’s dizziness, etc. This allows us to explore the character’s psychology and then try to understand the reasons that encourage Scottie to be a “manipulated manipulator”.\n\nOf course, there’s also a mega-narration in this film, which gives us a more objective vision of Scottie and the other characters. This one is expressed at some moments in the film but is stronger in the parts with Midge, when we are in a not too dramatic atmosphere, closer to reality. We can think of this long shot, at the beginning of the film, when we see Scottie and Midge discussing in her apartment or this shot of Midge trying to console Scottie at the hospital. We can finally say that Midge and Gavin Elster are not seen from Scottie’s point of view, because they don’t upset his journey. Of course, Gavin’s false kindness is only an illusion and Scottie will guess it, but too late. Madeleine/Judy creates Scottie’s greatest feelings, and she’s the one who will be seen from a subjective point of view (Scottie’s one).\n\n***\n\nThe End\n\n**Enjoy this blog’s content?

But it also revealed that how little I still “see” from the movies. To how many interesting and\n\nfascinating things in movies my eyes are still blind. I would disagree that either Vertigo or Citizen Kane would be the best film of all time. But if it was to be chosen between those two, Vertigo any day. Vertigo created many kinds of feelings from joy to irritation. Citizen Kane made me feel just boredom. Vertigo was fun at times but especially the part were Scottie tries to transform Judy to Madeleine was irritating. And I think a bit too long part as well. Vertigo was also one of the first and few classics and older films that I actually liked\n\nand found entertaining. And I especially got interested in the other films directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Before this I had seen only Psycho. I am also quite proud of myself since I was able to recognise the “ghostly halo around her” you (and Roger Ebert) mentioned. And proud, because earlier I haven’t been able to spot that kind of things from films, so my understanding of movies is progressing. Which is my goal and reason I also watch now older films and classics, which I haven’t earlier.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n- Cinematic Matches!

As you so eloquently state “a man who is able to keep is office as clean, would be able to make a clean murder.” I also agree with you that Vertigo should be seen as a super production given that it was shot in Technicolor and VistaVision. I too think that everybody (with the exception of Midge) is a manipulator in the film. You are also right about how green signifies infidelity and black symbolizes death. While I already knew that blue symbolizes fidelity, I completely forgot how essential it is to Scottie’s persona. See, like all great films, Vertigo offers something new on each different viewing 🙂 Virginie, If I was a member (for lack of better word) on the Pulitzer committee, I would nominate and award you the Pulitzer Prize for this essay and I sincerely mean it 🙂\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\nReply\n- Celebrating 10 Years of The Wonderful World of Cinema! – The Wonderful World of Cinema says: \n\nOctober 26, 2024 at 9:02 am \n\n\n[…] most popular post for 2015 is A Vertigo Analysis (14 513 views).

Today, I’ve decided to translate it and publish it on my blog so I could share it with you. Of course, this is only my own interpretation of the film and we can all find a different meaning in it. Anyway, I think it’s really one of the most interesting films to analyze. There’s so much to say!</p>\n\n        <p><movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n            <Director>Alfred Hitchcock</Director>\n            <ReleaseYear>1958</ReleaseYear>\n            <Genre>Film Noir</Genre>\n        </movie> is an American movie directed by the great <Director>Alfred Hitchcock</Director> and it was released in <ReleaseYear>1958</ReleaseYear>. Even if he was recognized for his talent before, it’s from 1954 that Hitchcock started to be known as “The Master of Suspense”. If the cinema of the 40’s was marked by the golden age of Film Noir, this genre will still be present in the 50’s, but in a less important way. The cinema of the 50’s is mainly marked by some superproductions, especially due to the invention of Cinemascope. This is, sometimes, unprofitable for the studios, due to the expensive cost of these new technologies. Can we talk of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> as a super production? This Technicolor film entirely shot in VistaVision was not a success, nor a commercial failure. As Hitchcock says in his interview with François Truffaut (Hitchcock/Truffaut), the film “couvrira ses frais” (covered its cost. Free translation by the author).</p>\n\n        <p><Director>Alfred Hitchcock</Director> was born in London on August 13, 1899. During his career as a movie maker, this kind of reserved man directed more than 50 films. Some of them will become quite important in the history of cinema: according to the BFI, <movie>\n            <Name>The 39 Steps</Name>\n        </movie> is the fourth best British film of all times; <movie>\n            <Name>Rear Window</Name>\n        </movie> is often considered to be his best film; we hesitate between <movie>\n            <Name>Citizen Kane</Name>\n        </movie> (Orson Welles) and <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> as the best film of all times. However, <movie>\n            <Name>Psycho</Name>\n        </movie> and <movie>\n            <Name>The Birds</Name>\n        </movie> remain his most well-known ones. Nominated five times at the Oscars for Best Director (Rebecca, Lifeboat, Spellbound, Rear Window, Psycho), <Director>Alfred Hitchcock</Director> was snubbed by the AMPAS and unfortunately never won one of those golden statuettes. This cold blondes lover died on April 29, 1980.</p>\n\n        <p>Before we’ll explore <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> more deeply, let’s now see what it is about. After an incident that happened during a nocturne police chase, Scottie (James Stewart), a policeman subject to acrophobia, retires from the profession. However, a relation, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), has a project for him: follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), who seems to be possessed by her ancestor Carlota Valdes’s spirit. After saving her from drowning, Scottie falls in love with Madeleine. However, she later commits suicide by jumping from a church window (important to notice that Carlotta Valdes had also killed herself). Scottie, aghast, is comforted by the truly good person in this story: his friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). Later, Scottie meets Judy, who shares a troubling resemblance with Madeleine. Becoming fascinated by her, he transforms her as the Madeleine he had once loved so deeply. We later learn that Judy IS Madeleine (or, well, a false Madeleine) and that all this story was created to hide the murder of the real Madeleine (committed by Galvin) in a suicide.</p>\n\n        <p>Let’s now explore the notion of aesthetic genre. <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> is first known as a <Genre>Film Noir</Genre>. Why? This film takes place in a western city (San Francisco). However, it doesn’t include a Humphrey Bogart look-alike private detective, but a retired policeman. Scottie still remains a very complex and ambiguous character. This is especially due to his acrophobia, which will be an obstacle for him all along the film. Scottie is also ambiguous because of his “behaviour”: even if Gavin is the evil one in the story, do we consider Scottie as a good or bad man? Of course, he is a hero when he saves Madeleine from drowning, but we seize a certain monstrosity in him during the second part of the film, when he reshapes Judy in the image of a dead person.</p>\n\n        <p>This film is also considered to be a <Genre>Film Noir</Genre> as it includes a femme fatale. Here, we are talking about Madeleine (or Judy as Madeleine). Judy will only have one signification for the protagonist when she’ll be Madeleine again. The femme fatale causes the loss of the private detective in the <Genre>Film Noir</Genre>. Manipulative, but in love, Judy/Madeleine will provoke Scottie’s emotive loss, but also her own loss (her death). There is also a fantastic and mysterious side in <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> due to its ghostly style: Carlota Valdes (a dead one) seems to possess Madeleine’s spirit. When Judy comes out of the bathroom transformed as Madeleine, there is a sort of ghostly halo around her. We’ll come back to that later. Of course, we understand, in the end, that this ghost story was invented by Gavin to enforce a sinisterly diabolic project. However, the illusion of fantastic is given to us during the entire film, even at the end when the nun suddenly appears at the top of the stairs like a ghost.</p>\n\n        <p>What can we say about the meaning, the sense of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>? If we explore the concrete and real dimension of this film, its sense is, according to me, the failure of manipulations: manipulations with bad intentions that, if we think about it, are finally unworthy if we analyze the film well. First, Gavin and Judy/false-Madeleine manipulate Scottie to conceal the murder of Galvin’s wife (the real Madeleine) with a suicide, but, ultimately, Gavin will have to run away from the country and Judy will finally really die. The other manipulation would be the one proceeded by Scottie on Judy: he recreates on her the image of a dead one, so he can really love her. We can notice that, before Judy becomes Madeleine, Scottie doesn’t really seem to be in love with her. But this will only lead Judy to her loss and Scottie to his. Even after Madeleine’s death, Judy continues to manipulate Scottie by playing the game. Substantially, everybody is wrong in this situation (except Midge, but we’ll come back to her). Those thoughtless manipulations will bring Scottie to his mental loss, Madeleine and Judy to their physical loss and to the loss of confidence in Gavin.</p>\n\n        <p>To understand better the meaning of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>, we will now analyse some important elements of the film. We’ll start by analyzing the places. If we begin with Gavin’s office, we can notice that this one has a classic look. The wooden furniture and its order give it an important and prestigious look. If we observe this office in a superficial way, it gives us the following message: Gavin is an ordinary and respected man, and nobody would have any suspicion about him. This allows Gavin to have the perfect image to manipulate Scottie. But the order in this office, that’s the key point: a man who is able to keep his office as clean, would be able to make a clean murder. What I mean by that is that, when Gavin kills his wife, everything is perfectly done. Even Judy writes it in her letter that she will finally never give to Scottie. A perfect murder, until a jewel spoils everything…</p>\n\n        <p>Ernie’s would be another interesting location to analyze. It is the story’s fetish restaurant. When Scottie first goes there, it’s to observe Madeleine for the first time. We are then only at the beginning of the film and Scottie doesn’t have any doubts about anything. The ambiance seems good, the ladies’ dresses fit with the restaurant’s red tapestry. It’s a very colourful moment. On the other side, when Scottie returns at Ernie’s after Madeleine’s death, the ambiance is much more sad, much more grey. This introduces us to the most dramatic part of the film, the one where everything is revealed.</p>\n\n        <p>Next, in the film, Madeleine visits many places to put Scottie on the wrong track: in the flower market, she buys a bouquet that looks like Carlotta Valdes’s one; at the cemetery, she pays a visit to Carlotta’s grave; at the museum, she observes a portrait of Carlotta Valdes; she goes to the hotel and Scottie learns that this hotel was Carlotta’s old house; the Golden Gate and the Spanish mission would be Madeleine’s suicide’s points. Carlotta possesses her and orders her to die. All those places will eventually lead Scottie into a trap and give him the illusion that Madeleine is really possessed by her ancestor.</p>\n\n        <p>We often see roads in this film. These can represent the path traced in advance for the characters: Scottie will ride on it until he loses his mind and Judy will ride on it until she dies. If Scottie and Judy know how to drive, it’s because they are in perfect control of the car, but there is always a chance for a bad maneuver and an accident. That’s what happens with all those characters’ manipulations.</p>\n\n        <p>Let’s conclude this analysis of the places by focusing on Midge’s house. On one hand, her office is quite messy, but, on the other hand, her kitchen is not. If her kitchen is well-organized, it’s because Judy knows how to “cook” her mind. She is the most reasoned one in this story. She is the first one not to believe Madeleine and Carlotta’s story. However, when the time comes to act, she can do it in a reckless way (we can think of the painting scene): that’s why her working place is in a mess.</p>\n\n        <p>We can now analyse some of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>‘s camera shots. During the introduction, we see a close up of a woman’s face, but it’s impossible to say exactly who it is: Madeleine? Judy? Carlotta Valdes? This confusion is the same one in Scottie’s head: Is he really with Madeleine or with Carlotta? Is he with Judy or Madeleine?</p>\n\n        <p>At the museum, we see a close up of Madeleine’s flower bouquet and then of Carlotta’s bouquet; a close-up of Madeleine’s bun and then one of Carlotta’s. Those elements are identical and create an association between Madeleine and Carlotta. The camera accentuates their importance by making close-ups. The situation is the same when we see this close-up of Carlotta’s necklace on Judy’s neck: this object is important because it reveals the truth to Scottie.</p>\n\n        <p>When Scottie does this “stepladder challenge”, we see him in a low angle shot. This gives him importance and he seems to control the situation. But, not long after, a subjective shot (Scottie’s point of view) shows us a high angle shot of the street. Scottie gets dizzy and collapses. We’ll later see a similar shot in the church at the Spanish mission. Those shots can symbolize Scottie’s fall: by having been manipulated by both Gavin and Judy, but also by having himself manipulated Judy to recreate Madeleine’s image on her.</p>\n\n        <p>Another significant shot would be the close-up of Madeleine and Scottie’s faces when they are in the car just after he saved her from the waters. They are face to face for the first time. Madeleine is unconscious and Scottie tries to wake her up. This is how a real relation between them starts. This, in a way, will make it easier for Judy to manipulate Scottie, because she will be in direct contact with him, but, in another way, this will become an obstacle for her because she will fall in love with Scottie and vice versa (that wasn’t planned in Gavin’s perfect murder plan).</p>\n\n        <p>We’ll end this part with the last shot. It is a full shot of Scottie coming out of the church’s window and looking down the roof where Judy fell. This shot focuses on the fact that the fear of heights, which has always been a barrier for Scottie, is now gone. This acrophobia was also a form of manipulation because it prevented Scottie to go further. Once more, this manipulation is a failure because Scottie, shaken by the events, manages to defeat it.</p>\n\n        <p>We’ll continue this analysis by mentioning some significant camera movements. One of the most important in <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> is the dolly zoom (also known as “Vertigo effect”), this movement where we have the feeling that the image moves away and gets closer at the same time. In the film, it is used to express Scottie’s giddiness. Just like gags in burlesque comedies, those movements are included in the film in a way to stop the story. Once more, we’re back to the idea of Scottie being manipulated by his dizziness. It first prevents him to climb on the footstool, but, more dramatically, to save Madeleine, the REAL Madeleine.</p>\n\n        <p>Another interesting camera movement happens when Scottie kisses “for the first” time Judy transformed as Madeleine under his desires. We could describe this movement as a “rotational traveling”. Indeed, Scottie kisses Judy, and the camera revolves around them, and then a new setting appears (the stable at the mission where Madeleine gave the clue to Scottie that she was going to kill herself). This camera shot, mixed with the music, adds a lot of deep emotions to the situation. Couldn’t this rotation also symbolise the turning point in those characters’ lives? It is, indeed, not a long time after this scene, that Scottie sees Carlotta’s famous necklace on Judy’s neck. It is also an emotional turn because Scottie wasn’t in love with Judy, but with Madeleine.</p>\n\n        <p>Let’s continue with some interesting lightings used in <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>. The lighting in this film adds a lot of meaning, a lot of signification to the situation. Here are some examples: when Scottie goes to the cemetery, the natural light seems fuzzy, foggy and ghostly. The same lighting is used in a more important way when Judy comes out of the bathroom completely transformed as Madeleine. From Scottie’s perspective, she comes from the dead. At the cemetery, this fuzzy lighting adds some mystery to Madeleine, who seems to be more and more unreal, possessed by a ghost. This is, once more, a manipulation tool, because this lighting gives a false illusion about Madeleine’s (or Judy) real identity. It doesn’t only fool Scottie, but also the spectators.</p>\n\n        <p>In the film’s introduction, the lighting is sort of red, and that’s also the case in Scottie’s dream. What does it mean? Red is the color of love, but in <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>‘s case, it can be more deeply associated with “passion”: the crazy love passion Scottie has for Madeleine. This color also symbolizes the present. This is a clue concerning the conspiracy (Madeleine is not really possessed by Carlotta), but it also is a way to warn for Scottie: wouldn’t that be better if he’ll learn to live in the present time? It’s by being haunted by his past that he’ll get mad and take possession of Judy.</p>\n\n        <p>The music would be another interesting element to explore. This one was brilliantly composed by Hitchcock’s fetish composer: Bernard Herrmann. The music is mainly here to point out the film’s atmosphere: the one felt by Scottie, but also the one felt by us. What we generally hear in this film is a mysterious and worrisome music, proper to Hitchcockian cinema. This one is here to accentuate the suspense in the situation. What will happen to Madeleine? How will all this end? This music takes more importance when Scottie follows Madeleine to those diverse places associated to Carlotta Valdes (the cemetery, the museum, the flower market, etc.). During the more dramatic moments, the music becomes more vigorous and more orchestral. We can think of Madeleine’s suicide attempt (next to the Golden Gate), to the chase in the church’s stairs, to the kiss next to the rough sea, etc. Finally, let’s remember that Scottie doesn’t like music or, at least, classical music. At the beginning of the film, when he is at Midge’s place, he asks her to stop the music. After Madeleine’s death, the doctor suggests him to start music-therapy, but, according to Midge, this doesn’t really seem to work. After leaving all these great emotions, Scottie probably needs some silent peace.</p>\n\n        <p>Let’s continue with some elements/items that are important to make us understand the sense of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>. First of all, the color green appears many times in the film: Madeleine’s green dress, Judy’s green clothes, the green neons in the Empire Hotel, the green tapestry in the hotel, etc. Even if it is a calming color, green can be associated to death, to the mildew (that’s what happens to a dead body after a certain time): Madeleine is possessed by a dead lady. Green is also a symbol of infidelity: Gavin’s infidelity towards his wife, but also towards Scottie; Scottie’s infidelity towards himself (will he be happy with Madeleine? Is he doing the right thing by recreating Madeleine’s image on Judy?). Green confuses the situations.</p>\n\n        <p>Then, many items and situations make us do a connection with the notion of death, which is one of the main themes of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>. We can think of those mortuary items having purposes of falseness (the objects associated to Carlotta): the grave, the bouquet, the necklace, Madeleine’s suicide attempt, Madeleine’s dream, etc. We can also associate this notion of death to something that haunts Scottie and the film’s atmosphere: Scottie’s dream, Judy’s black dress at the end of the film (black is a symbol of death), the church at the mission, the nun who looks like a ghost, Scottie’s necrophilia.</p>\n\n        <p>Another element that is proper to many of Hitchcock’s films (Psycho, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Shadow of a Doubt) are the stairs. In <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>, those stairs are an obstacle for Scottie. Scottie’s dizziness created by the church’s stairs prevents him to reach his goal. Gavin then takes the occasion to kill the real Madeleine without being seen (only by Judy).</p>\n\n        <p>Finally, two objects give us the truth about Gavin’s diabolic conspiracy: first, Judy’s letter, which only she and the spectators know the existence of (we then wonder what will be Scottie’s reaction) and Carlotta’s necklace (that Judy will imprudently wear). It’s this last element that will reveal the truth to Scottie. So, Scottie understands that he has been manipulated, but the spectators also were, because, during the entire film, we thought Madeleine was really possessed, just like Scottie thought so.</p>\n\n        <p>We’ll conclude this part by analyzing the characters and their importance in the story. John “Scottie” Ferguson is the protagonist. He suffers from vertigo (here, the title “Vertigo” becomes isotopic), but he also suffers from a big naivety. It’s because of those two elements that he will be a victim of Gavin’s setup. After Madeleine’s death, Scottie becomes sort of necrophile and, a manipulator too, if we consider his influence on Judy. Scottie succeeds to control his dizziness at the end of the film when he climbs all the stairs in the church. We could associate Scottie to the color blue (blue eyes, blue pyjamas, blue car…). This color is a symbol of fidelity. Scottie, faithful to his feelings for Madeleine, will resurrect her. He is also loyal to his desire to overcome his acrophobia and will succeed at the end of the film.</p>\n\n        <p>As she writes in her letter, Judy Barton (or the false Madeleine) is the tool in Gavin’s plan. She’s the one who will lead Scottie in a world of deceits: she manipulates him, especially when she pretends that she didn’t go to certain places during her day. We can notice that the brunette Judy often looks at herself in a mirror. What does it mean? Maybe she’s trying to find her real identity, this identity she’s losing by playing a role. Those last moments of observation happen before she takes Madeleine’s appearance one more time (for Scottie): Judy will die as Madeleine. The real Judy is forgotten at the end of the film, especially by Scottie.</p>\n\n        <p>In this story, Marjorie Wood (Midge), an underclothes designer, is the only truly good person. She’s a friend and a confidante for Scottie, but also a mother. Many clues in the film give us this impression, first by this quote: “It’s a brassiere! You know about those things, you’re a big boy now.” when Scottie observes the aeronautical bra. She talks to him just like a mother talks to her little boy to teach him new things. She’s the only character who really takes care about Scottie and who knows him well. For example, after Madeleine’s death, the doctor suggests him to do music-therapy, but Midge knows it won’t work because Scottie is not really a music lover. Finally, she’s the only character who doesn’t manipulate another one and, as a result, she’s the only character who remains rational in this situation.</p>\n\n        <p>Lastly, Gavin Elster is the ultimate manipulator in this story. He gives a false impression of friendship to Scottie, a false impression of being a man we can trust. Gavin is a shipbuilder and we can make a connection with his evil project: build, with Judy, a lie that Scottie’s naivety will unfortunately believe.</p>\n\n        <p>Sooner in the text, I mentioned that <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> was generally associated with the <Genre>Film Noir</Genre> genre, but that it also included a part of fantastic. How does that contribute to the atmosphere and the film’s meaning? Let’s start with the <Genre>Film Noir</Genre> dimension. This one adds tension to the film, particularly in the relations between the characters. As for the meaning of the film (the failure of manipulations), this <Genre>Film Noir</Genre> dimension is much more evident in the second part of the film, after Madeleine’s death, when the spectator understands that the “femme fatale” (Judy or “false Madeleine”) will provoke the loss of a policeman (Scottie) by manipulating him. We also discover a certain ambiguity concerning Scottie, especially when he’s trying to recreate Madeleine’s image on Judy. Is he good or bad? Well, he is, for sure, a victim. Concerning the fantastic dimension of <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> (or we should say this “illusion of fantastic”), this one creates an atmosphere of confusion and anxiety. Carlotta Valdes’s story grabs our attention and we want to know what will happen to Madeleine/Judy, but also to Scottie. Of course, this illusion is created by Gavin and Judy, who create a FALSE impression of madness around Madeleine, which provokes Scottie’s REAL madness.</p>\n\n        <p>We will continue this <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie> analysis by understanding how the film is presented to us. Here, the objective of this film is not only to show us something in a static way, but also to tell us a story, thanks to a variety of camera movements and camera shots. For instance, after Madeleine has run away to the church, it’s with the help of only three camera shots that we understand that she’s about to kill herself: a long shot of Madeleine running to the church, a low angle shot of the bell tower (where she will kill herself) and a medium close-up of a terrified Scottie looking at the bell tower. The offscreen dimension becomes important here.</p>\n\n        <p>Finally, what can we say about <movie>\n            <Name>Vertigo</Name>\n        </movie>‘s narrator? The film is mainly seen from Scottie’s point of view. Many subjective camera shots make us understand that: the subjective shots of Scottie following Madeleine in his car, the shot of Madeleine’s dead body on the church’s roof (we previously saw Scottie looking at the window, so we know he’s the one looking at her), a close-up of Carlotta’s necklace in Judy’s neck (that’s when Scottie understands the real meaning of this adventure), the Vertigo zooms expressing Scottie’s dizziness, etc. This allows us to explore the character’s psychology and then try to understand the reasons that encourage Scottie to be a “manipulated manipulator”. Of course, there’s also a mega-narration in this film, which gives us a more objective vision of Scottie and the other characters. This one is expressed at some moments in the film but is stronger in the parts with Midge, when we are in a not too dramatic atmosphere, closer to reality. We can think of this long shot, at the beginning of the film, when we see Scottie and Midge discussing in her apartment or this shot of Midge trying to console Scottie at the hospital. We can finally say that Midge and Gavin Elster are not seen from Scottie’s point of view, because they don’t upset his journey. Of course, Gavin’s false kindness is only an illusion and Scottie will guess it, but too late. Madeleine/Judy creates Scottie’s greatest feelings, and she’s the one who will be seen from a subjective point of view (Scottie’s one).</p>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to maintain readability while incorporating the required XML tags based on the attributes from the ADT.

Many critics and film enthusiasts consider Chinatown the greatest screenplay ever written, and the film is frequently listed among the greatest films ever made.\n\nThe 1974 American neo-noir mystery, directed by Roman Polanski and written by Towne, features Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway in leading roles. The plot was inspired by the early 20th-century California water wars, which involved conflicts over water rights in the Owens Valley. Produced by Robert Evans and distributed by Paramount Pictures, this film marked Polanski’s final work in the United States. It embodies classic film noir characteristics, blending mystery with psychological drama.\n\nUpon its release on June 20, 1974, Chinatown received widespread critical acclaim. At the 47th Academy Awards, it garnered 11 nominations, with Towne winning Best Original Screenplay. The film also earned accolades at the Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Drama, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. The American Film Institute ranked it second among the top ten mystery films. In 1991, the Library of Congress preserved Chinatown in the United States National Film Registry for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance.\n\nA sequel, The Two Jakes, was released in 1990. It starred and was directed by Nicholson, with Towne again handling the screenplay. However, it achieved a different level of critical success than the original.\n\n\n\nWritten by: Robert Towne\n\nDirected by: Roman Polanski\n\nGenre: Whydunit (Noir Whydunit) – The three elements of a Whydunit are: the Detective, the Secret, and the Dark Turn.\n\nCinematic cousins: Body Heat, The Two Jakes, The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, LA Confidential, The Big Lebowski, The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, Blue Velvet, The American Friend, Brick, The Samurai (Le Samourai)\n\nOpening Image: A grainy photograph of a man and woman making love during a private picnic sets the tone of voyeurism and betrayal. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective, is in his office with Curly (Burt Young), a client who is devastated by the photographic evidence of his wife’s infidelity.\n\nTheme Stated: Jake’s cynical attitude towards his work and the world introduces the theme of corruption and moral ambiguity. His line, “Alright, Curly, enough’s enough. You can’t eat the Venetian blinds. I just had them installed on Wednesday,” humorously underscores the futility and absurdity of his profession, hinting at the more prominent theme of the impossibility of achieving true justice in a corrupt system.\n\nFirst Whydunit element: The Detective does not change; we do. Jake’s cynical attitude and world-weary demeanor set the stage. Throughout the film, he remains steadfast in his quest, driven by a sense of justice despite overwhelming corruption. The audience’s understanding of the world’s complexity and moral ambiguity deepens, even if Jake remains unchanged.\n\nSet-Up: Jake meets his next client, Mrs. Mulwray (Diane Ladd), an older woman who suspects her husband of infidelity. Jake feigns surprise as Mrs. Mulwray explains her intuition about her husband cheating. Despite Jake suggesting that if she genuinely loves him, she should go home, Mrs. Mulwray is determined to uncover the truth. She reveals that her husband, Hollis Mulwray, is the chief engineer for the Department of Water and Power.\n\nDetective Jake Gittes is on the job.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJake follows Hollis. At City Hall, a speaker emphasizes L.A.’s dire need for water, highlighting its desert-like conditions. The proposal for a new deal to bring water to the city is met with enthusiastic applause. Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling) takes the stage next, arguing that further engineering work would lead to flooding and a broken dam. His remarks are met with boos from the crowd, and an irate farmer (Rance Howard) disrupts the meeting by releasing sheep into the hall, accusing Mulwray of conspiring to deprive their livestock and crops of water, keeping it in the hands of the powerful few.\n\nA car drives along a ravine that leads to the dry Los Angeles River. From a distance, Jake uses binoculars to watch as Hollis Mulwray exits the vehicle and briefly talks to a boy on horseback. Mulwray then examines the parched riverbed at the bottom of the ravine.\n\nFrom his car, Jake uses the side mirror to observe Mulwray. He sees Hollis head to the coast and stare out at the ocean. As night falls, Jake watches, and Hollis remains by the shore. A water pipe springs to life suddenly, releasing a powerful stream of water that flows into the sea.\n\nReturning to his car, Jake finds a campaign flier on the windshield. The flier advocates for a vote to approve an engineering project to bring water to L.A., warning that the city is at risk of severe drought.\n\nJake then places a stopwatch under Mulwray’s car tire. The next day, back at his office, Jake examines the broken watch, noting that Mulwray was out there all night.\n\nJake’s assistant, Walsh (Joe Mantell), shows him photographs of Hollis Mulwray arguing with an older man. Walsh mentions that he overheard “apple core” but couldn’t make out more. Jake is visibly frustrated.\n\nJake receives a tip about Mulwray’s location and follows him to Echo Park. Jake and Walsh sit on a boat in the park’s pond, photographing Hollis as he enjoys a boat ride with another woman who is not his wife. Jake later follows Hollis to a patio, capturing a photo of him kissing the woman. The eager detective accidentally knocks a tile loose from the roof, nearly drawing attention to himself.\n\nNewspaper headlines scream about Mulwray’s affair. Jake holds the paper as the barber praises his investigative skills. Another patron mocks Jake’s line of work, accusing him of ruining lives by exposing infidelities. Jake retorts, accusing the man of profiting off foreclosures on struggling families and insisting he earns an honest living. The barber attempts to lighten the mood by telling a crude joke about Chinese people.\n\nJake recounts the same joke at his office to his assistants Walsh and Duffy (Bruce Glover). He’s so engrossed in his story that he doesn’t notice a woman standing behind him. His assistants, embarrassed, remain silent. Jake wraps up the joke and turns around, only to be met with the sight of the woman, his laughter quickly fading.\n\nCatalyst: The real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), much younger than the woman who previously hired Jake, confronts him, revealing that the woman who hired him was an imposter. “I don’t get tough, Mister Gittes,” the stone-faced woman says. “My lawyer does.” The detective is issued a court summons.\n\nDebate: This twist propels Jake to investigate why he was set up and who is behind the deception. Jake heads to Hollis Mulwray’s office to speak with him, but the secretary informs him that Hollis is out. Undeterred, Jake enters Hollis’s office and spots a photo of the woman Hollis was allegedly having an affair with on his desk. He also notices an upcoming appointment on Hollis’s schedule.\n\nThe Water and Power Department deputy chief, Russ Yelburton (John Hillerman), enters and chats with Jake. They walk to Yelburton’s office together, engaging in a friendly conversation. Yelburton insists that Hollis isn’t the type who would cheat on his wife. Before leaving, Jake discreetly takes a few of Yelburton’s business cards.\n\nBreak into Two: Jake heads to Hollis Mulwray’s house and rings the bell. A servant answers and lets him in. In the backyard garden, another servant, tending to a pond, mentions to Jake that the water is “bad for the grass.” Jake initially mishears it as “bad for the glass” and is momentarily puzzled. (Jake doesn’t realize it then, but it’s the clue that will later break the case.) As Jake investigates the pond and notices something, he moves to investigate further but stops when…\n\nB Story: Evelyn Mulwray greets him. She informs Jake that Hollis isn’t home, and they sit for iced tea. During their conversation, Jake suspects someone has set Hollis up to be caught in an adultery scandal. Evelyn agrees to drop the lawsuit against Jake, but he insists on uncovering the truth. He wants to find Hollis and assist him. Evelyn suggests he check the reservoirs, as Hollis often visits them. The relationship begins—Evelyn will help Jake solve and be a large part of the mystery.\n\nEvelyn Mulwray is an elegant woman of mystery, characteristic of noir films.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFun and Games: Jake drives to the reservoir and encounters police officers who inform him that the area is closed to the public. Jake uses one of Yelburton’s business cards to impersonate him and gain access.\n\nAt the reservoir, the detectives recognize Jake and strike up a conversation. The lead detective, Lou Escobar (Perry Lopez), mentions that he’s no longer assigned to the Chinatown beat.\n\nFinally, the detectives reveal the reason for their presence: a suspicious death. They are in the process of pulling Hollis Mulwray’s lifeless body out of the reservoir. And now we have murder: the promise of the premise!\n\nThe detectives question Mrs. Mulwray at their office, asking if Hollis was suicidal over the affair coming to light, with Jake also present. Evelyn admits that Hollis was upset, and they argued about it. She falsely claims she hired Jake to investigate Hollis, and Jake follows her story.\n\nOutside the office, Mrs. Mulwray officially hires Jake to investigate her husband’s death and uncover the truth.\n\nBack inside, Jake examines Hollis’s body and speaks with the coroner. The coroner shows Jake another body, that of a local man who supposedly drowned in the city river. Jake points out the improbability given the river’s dry state.\n\nSecond Whydunit element: The Secret surrounding Hollis’s murder and the water conspiracy drives Jake relentlessly. Despite potential gains or dangers, he is compelled to solve the mystery. The gravity of the conspiracy, involving city-wide water theft and murder, propels him forward.\n\nJake returns to the river to investigate further and encounters the same boy on the horse who spoke with Hollis. The boy tells Jake that Hollis was concerned about the water in the river, noting that every night, water gushes into different parts of it.\n\nLater, Jake drives to the reservoir at night when it’s deserted. As he walks around the perimeter, gunshots ring out, forcing him to take cover in an empty concrete water channel. Suddenly, water surges through the channel, and Jake barely escapes.\n\nAs Jake tries to leave by climbing a fence, Claude Mulvihill (Roy Jenson) and a midget with a switchblade (Roman Polanski) confront him. Claude restrains Jake while the short man cuts his nostril, warning him to stay away from the reservoir or risk losing his entire nose.\n\nNow sporting a large bandage on his nose, Jake is back in his office. He explains to his assistants that he’s uncovered a scheme to divert water illegally, but they are hesitant to pursue it.\n\nJake receives a call from a woman named Ida Sessions, who admits to impersonating Mrs. Mulwray. She claims she had no idea Hollis would be killed. Though she refuses to reveal who hired her, she hints that one of the culprits is mentioned in the day’s obituary section of the L.A. Post-Record newspaper.\n\nJake heads to a restaurant, scours the newspaper, and meets Evelyn Mulwray. He confronts her, suspecting she isn’t telling him everything, notably since she quickly drops the lawsuit and has him lie to the detectives about the impersonator.\n\nJake accuses Evelyn of withholding information, to which she admits she knew about her husband’s affair and claims she had her affairs as well. Jake learns that her maiden name is Cross.\n\nOutside, Jake tells Evelyn he believes her husband was murdered and that there’s a conspiracy to steal the city’s water. He still thinks she’s hiding something and drives away, missing her call as she seems ready to divulge more.\n\nJake then visits Yelburton’s office but he is out for lunch. While waiting, Jake notices photos on the wall featuring Hollis Mulwray and a man named Noah Cross (John Huston). Yelburton’s secretary informs Jake that Cross and Mulwray co-owned the water company until Mulwray ensured it became public property.\n\nWhen Yelburton returns, Jake confronts him, accusing him of killing Mulwray for discovering the water theft and hiring the fake Mrs. Mulwray. Yelburton denies the accusations, claiming they’ve only been diverting water to aid orange farmers, which results in some runoff. Jake remains doubtful and tells Yelburton to contact him if he comes clean.\n\nMidpoint: (False Victory) Jake finds Mrs. Mulwray already waiting for him at his office. He confides that he doesn’t yet understand how the people responsible for her husband’s death plan to benefit from draining the reservoirs, but he intends to uncover the truth, starting the ticking clock. Mrs. Mulwray decides to officially hire him to solve the mystery of her husband’s death, tying together A and B Stories.\n\nJake inquires whether she married Hollis after her father, Noah Cross, sold the water company. She confirms that the marriage occurred afterward. Evelyn appears anxious and admits as much. She explains that she and Hollis had a falling out over the water company, not because of personal issues. Hollis was furious with her father for convincing him to build the dam that eventually failed, leading to their estrangement and raising the stakes.\n\nJake and Evelyn team up to solve the mystery of Hollis Mulray’s murder.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBad Guys Close In: Jake heads to the seaside to visit Noah Cross at the Albacore Club. Over a lavish meal, Jake reveals his belief that Hollis was murdered, while the police think it was an accident. He mentions his past work on the Chinatown beat with Escobar, the lead investigator, whom he respects for his competence.\n\nJake breaks bread with Noah Cross, a greedy and evil man.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoah expresses concern that Jake might exploit the situation for financial gain by charging his daughter for something the police are already handling. He warns Jake that he needs to understand the problem entirely. Jake retorts that he used to hear the same warning from the D.A. in Chinatown.\n\nTheir conversation shifts to finding Hollis’s potential murderer. Jake asks Noah when he last saw Hollis. Noah initially claims ignorance, but Jake points out the photos showing them arguing. Noah recalls the argument and attributes it to issues concerning his daughter, though he refuses to elaborate. When pressed, Noah suggests the argument was about Hollis’s mistress, stating he didn’t want Evelyn to know, and advises Jake to find the mistress.\n\nJake heads to City Hall to examine the records for the Northwest Valley, where Yelburton claimed the orange groves were being irrigated. Reviewing the documents, he notices many recently pasted names indicating new landowners. He realizes that most of the land has been purchased a short time ago. Discreetly, Jake tears the page out of the record book and takes it with him.\n\nNext, Jake drives to the Northwest Valley and trespasses into the orange groves. Suddenly, someone shoots at him, forcing him to speed through the groves. A man on horseback appears, blocking his path and forcing Jake to halt. As he assesses his next move, farmers ambush him, shooting out his radiator and a tire, leaving him with no choice but to retreat.\n\nA struggle ensues, and one of the farmers beats Jake with a crutch. They finally subdue him and demand to know why he’s there. Jake explains that he’s investigating whether the Water Department is irrigating their land.\n\nThe farmers reveal that the Water Department has been poisoning their wells and blowing up their tanks, sabotaging them instead of irrigating the groves. When Jake mentions he’s working for Mrs. Mulwray and that Hollis Mulwray is dead, one of the farmers accuses Mulwray, leading to an insult from Jake, resulting in the farmer knocking him out.\n\nJake learns the secret behind the mystery land and water rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen Jake regains consciousness, he finds Evelyn looking over him at the farmer’s house—the farmer had called her. On their drive back, Jake realizes that the new dam, which Hollis opposed, is a ruse. Instead of diverting water to L.A., it will redirect water to benefit those buying land in the Northwest Valley.\n\nJake explains that Ida Sessions had directed him to the obituaries because one of the new landowners, Jaspar Lamar Crabb, had recently died. Despite Crabb’s death two weeks ago, he somehow managed to purchase land in the valley a week after his death.\n\nThey stop at the rest home where Jaspar Lamar Crabb had resided, and Jake leads Evelyn inside, pretending they are a married couple searching for a place for their father.\n\nOnce inside, Jake notices that all the names of the new landowners in the valley match the names of the residents at the rest home. As he speaks with some of them, he learns that no elderly residents know they supposedly own land.\n\nJake discovers that the rest home receives funding from the Albacore Club, where he met Noah Cross. However, the supervisor interrupts, informing Jake that someone is at the door to see him. Outside, Jake finds Claude Mulvihill waiting.\n\nJake instructs Evelyn to head to the car, then attacks Claude, seeking retribution for his injured nose. As he fights, the small man who had previously cut his nose starts to give chase, but Evelyn swiftly arrives in the car and picks Jake up. They make a quick escape while Claude’s goons fire at them.\n\nThey share a drink at Evelyn’s house, and Jake thanks her for rescuing him. They flirt, and Jake confides that during his time in Chinatown, the cases he handled were often confusing and complex, much like the current one. He had tried to do as little as possible to avoid inadvertently helping criminals.\n\nEvelyn helps Jake remove the bandage and clean his nose wound. While doing so, Jake notices a discoloration in the iris of Evelyn’s eye. He moves closer to examine the flaw, and they end up kissing. The flaw in her eye may represent her damaged past and the hidden truths in her life, especially relating to her father and the dark secrets she’s been forced to keep.\n\nLater, Jake and Evelyn lie in bed together, talking. Jake recounts how working in Chinatown brought him nothing but bad luck—it was impossible to understand the situation entirely. He tells her about when he tried to protect someone but ended up causing her harm instead.\n\nThe phone rings, and they exchange glances before Evelyn answers it. She quickly says she’ll be right there and, before leaving, instructs Jake not to ask any questions. Before departing, she reveals that her father, Noah, owns the Albacore Club. Jake acknowledges this, mentioning that he met Noah, which unsettles Evelyn.\n\nJake tells her Noah claimed she was jealous and worried she might harm Mulwray’s girlfriend. Evelyn explains that her father is dangerous and possibly responsible for her husband’s death. As she showers, Jake sneaks out, breaking the taillight on her car so she won’t notice him following her.\n\nHe trails Evelyn to a house where he sees her meeting with one of her servants and the woman he believed to be Hollis’s mistress. It seems they are keeping the woman confined in a bedroom. Evelyn talks to her, offering a pill that the woman initially refuses but eventually takes.\n\nWhen Evelyn leaves the house, Jake confronts her in her car, accusing her of holding Hollis’s mistress captive. Evelyn denies this, explaining that the woman is too distraught over Hollis’s death. Jake counters that they’re trying to keep her from revealing something important.\n\nFinally, Evelyn admits that the woman is her sister. Jake is bewildered and presses for more details, asking if Hollis is having an affair with her sister. Evelyn breaks down, insisting she never harmed Hollis. Jake, still puzzled, bids her goodnight and leaves.\n\nAs Jake lies in bed, his phone rings. He answers to hear a man’s voice saying Ida Sessions wants to speak with him. Jake responds that she should call him directly. The phone rings again, and the voice provides an address where Jake can meet Ida.\n\nAll Is Lost: The following day, Jake drives to the given address and notices signs of a break-in. He cautiously enters the house and searches around, eventually finding Ida’s body in the kitchen, the whiff of death. He inspects her wallet and its contents.\n\nDark Night of the Soul: Lt. Escobar and another detective appear from the bathroom, revealing they are already investigating the scene. They talk to Jake, and tensions rise, nearly leading to a confrontation between Jake and one of the detectives. The detectives show Jake photographs of Hollis when Ida impersonates Mrs. Mulwray. Escobar deduces that someone was setting up both Jake and Hollis. He also reveals that Hollis had saltwater, not freshwater, in his lungs.\n\nJake explains to Escobar about the water theft that Hollis uncovered, which led to his murder. He takes Escobar to the water pipe near the ocean where the stolen water is being dumped, but the pipe is dry during the day. Another officer arrives and relays Yelburton’s claim that the water is merely runoff from irrigating the Northwest Valley, information Jake is already aware of.\n\nJake then goes to Evelyn’s house and finds it being prepared for her departure, suggesting she is moving out. She’s not there. In the backyard, the same servant tending the pond earlier mentions that the pond’s water is bad for the grass because it is saltwater. Jake inspects the pond and discovers a pair of glasses at the bottom, the object he had noticed earlier. He realizes this is where Hollis met his end.\n\nBreak into Three: Jake rushes to the house where Evelyn stays with Hollis’s alleged mistress, Catherine (Belinda Palmer), her sister. Confronting Evelyn, Jake demands to see Catherine, noting that Evelyn appears ready to leave. He calls Escobar, instructing him to come to the house, while Evelyn watches anxiously. She asks Jake to explain what’s happening, tying A and B Stories together.\n\nFive-Point Finale:\n\nGathering the Team: Jake reveals Hollis’s glasses, which he found in the pond, asserting that Hollis was drowned there. He insists on knowing the truth, suspecting that Evelyn killed Hollis and is keeping the mistress confined because she knows too much.\n\nEvelyn promises to reveal the truth, disclosing that Catherine is her daughter. Jake slaps her, prompting Evelyn to clarify that the woman is her sister and daughter. Then, he slaps her again and says it’s her daughter. She keeps saying both as Jake slaps her and throws her down. A darker, violent side of Jake goes into full throttle as he forces Evelyn to reveal the awful, awful truth. Finally, Evelyn says that the girl is both her sister and her daughter—her father had sex with her, and the girl is their daughter.\n\nShe tells Jake that it happened when she was fifteen, and she couldn’t be with Catherine since she was so young and not in control. Now, she wants to be with her daughter and run away from her father. Jake tells her to escape.\n\nEvelyn goes upstairs first, but before she goes, she tells Jake that the glasses aren’t Hollis’s since he didn’t wear bifocals. Jake realizes that they’re Noah’s and that Noah killed Hollis. Evelyn’s daughter briefly says hello to Jake.\n\nAfter Evelyn and her daughter have fled, Jake phones his assistants and tells them to meet him at Evelyn’s servant’s address in Chinatown, where Evelyn will hide before leaving.\n\nThe detectives arrive to arrest Evelyn but are too late.\n\nThird Whydunit element: The Dark Turn shows the detective breaking the rules. Jake’s pursuit of the truth leads him to break his own rules, such as attacking Claude Mulvihill and manipulating situations to uncover the conspiracy. His desperation to reveal the truth and protect Evelyn and her daughter forces him to act against his established methods, highlighting the dark turn in his journey.\n\nExecuting the Plan: Jake and Escobar head to the house where he claims Evelyn is hiding. However, they end up at Curly’s home, the same man Jake helped catch his cheating wife at the story’s start. (Curly’s wife now sports a black eye.)\n\nJake goes in first, pretending he wants to talk to Evelyn alone. Since Curly owes him a favor, Jake convinces Curly to drive him out as they escape through the backdoor of the house. Jake hides in the backseat to avoid Escobar’s notice.\n\nJake offers Curly money to meet him later and help transport some passengers (Evelyn and Catherine) out of town. Curly agrees, but only for payment. He gets Curly to drop him off at Evelyn’s recently abandoned house. He then calls Noah Cross and arranges to meet him there.\n\nOnce Noah arrives, Jake quickly reveals that he knows the girl is Evelyn’s daughter. He shows Noah an obituary from the paper and explains that he knows Noah drowned Hollis in the pond and is scheming to steal water.\n\nNoah admits to moving forward with his plan to steal the water. He intends to force Los Angeles to incorporate the valley, now supplied with water, into the city, thereby compelling L.A. to buy the water directly from him.\n\nTheir conversation shifts to Evelyn, with Noah confessing that he doesn’t blame himself for his actions, noting that most people don’t realize what they can do.\n\nHigh Tower Surprise: Claude Mulvihill, working for Noah, arrives and puts a gun to Jake’s head, forcing Jake to hand over the damaged bifocals.\n\nDig, Deep Down: Cross and Mulvihill compel Jake to accompany them to Chinatown, where they encounter the detectives and Jake’s assistants.\n\nExecuting the New Plan: Jake attempts to explain the truth about Cross’s actions to Escobar, but the detectives ignore him. Evelyn arrives with Catherine, and Cross moves to intercept them, addressing his granddaughter/daughter as her grandpa. Evelyn yells at him to stay away and then pulls a gun on him.\n\nShe gets into the car and shoots Noah in the arm. The police open fire as Evelyn tries to drive away, causing the vehicle to come to a stop. Evelyn has been fatally shot through the eye. (Her death through her flawed eye signifies the tragic climax of these secrets and the inescapable nature of her fate.)\n\nCatherine screams in anguish. Noah pulls his wailing granddaughter/daughter from the car, shielding her eyes from the scene. He now has Catherine to himself. Evil has won.\n\nFinal Image: Jake stands in shock, filled with regret for not being able to help Evelyn or resolve the situation. Escobar angrily orders Jake’s assistants to take him from the scene, and they comply. Walsh tells his employer: “Forget it, Jake, it’s Chinatown.”\n\nAs an audience, we’re transformed because there will be no justice for the deaths of Hollis and Evelyn Mulwray. Noah Cross wins, and Jake Gittes loses. Evil prevails in a place like Chinatown—without a pat Hollywood ending.\n\n“Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSave the Cat! 2024 Screenplay Challenge TV Pilot and Feature\nGrand Prize Winners\n\nDeadpool Beat Sheet Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Don Roff\n\nAward-winning author Don Roff has written nearly 20 books, primarily of a scary nature, for children and adults.

Writer, Producer, and Director Sir Christopher Nolan accepted these terms, as long as they did not get in the way of the making of the movie. That did not prevent clashes, though; at one point Thorne spent two weeks talking Nolan out of an idea about travelling faster than light.\n\n- GoofsTwo characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform. A moment later, a panoramic shot shows them fighting on a very different place.\n\n- QuotesCooper: We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe Warner Bros, Paramount, Syncopy and Legendary Pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing Earth's arid dry state in the film.\n\n- Alternate versionsThe 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Trailer Failure: Interstellar (2013)\n\n- SoundtracksDo Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night\n(uncredited)\nWritten by Dylan Thomas\n\n### User reviews6.6K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Out of this world\n\nA lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.\n\nGoing out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...\n\n- kosmasp\n- May 30, 2015\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ34\n\n- How long is Interstellar?Powered by Alexa\n- Can someone how \"love\" and emotions can be considered quantifiable??\n- Why did Earth change its history books to claim that the Apollo missions to the Moon were faked?\n- How did Cooper figure out NASA's location?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - November 6, 2014 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - United Kingdom\n    - Canada\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official Twitter\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Interestelar\n- Filming locations\n    - Iceland\n- Production companies\n    - Paramount Pictures\n    - Warner Bros.\n    - Legendary Entertainment\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $165,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $203,227,580\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $47,510,360\n    - Nov 9, 2014\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $758,464,713\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 49 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Datasat\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - IMAX 6-Track\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film dramatizes Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nOppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It was Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule.[9] Murphy was the first cast member to join, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, selected scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.\n\nOppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal Pictures. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer received critical acclaim and grossed $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all time at the time of its release.\n\nThe recipient of many accolades, Oppenheimer was nominated for thirteen awards at the 96th Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director (Nolan), Best Actor (Murphy), and Best Supporting Actor (Downey). It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.\n\n## Plot\n\nWhile the film is shown in a , the following is the chronological order of events that happen in the film.\n\nIn 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of Cambridge in England. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett, leaving him a poisoned apple, but he later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany.\n\nOppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist psychiatrist who later dies in an apparent suicide.[a]\n\nWhen nuclear fission is discovered in 1938, after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis sooner.\n\nOppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could destroy the world; after consulting with Albert Einstein and having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are \"near zero\". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n\nAfter Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development.\n\nAs an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioactive isotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonate their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947, though he had in fact expressed his belief that he had caused a chain reaction that would one day destroy the world.\n\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer's Q clearance, during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a kangaroo court. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty vigorously defends herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but still revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.\n\nIn 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, enraging him. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(left) plays .\n\n- Cillian Murphy as J.

Sherwin are the authors of J. Robert Oppenheimer's biography American Prometheus (2005), on which the film is based.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector Sam Mendes was interested in adapting the 2005 Oppenheimer biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. After that project failed to materialize, the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the next fifteen years. The authors became pessimistic about a film adaptation. Oliver Stone declined an opportunity to direct, saying \"I couldn't find my way to its essence\".[54][55] In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.[55] Woods said he was asked not to promote the film because his outspoken political views posed a risk to the film's commercial success and awards campaign.[56]\n\nNolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading American Prometheus.[57] In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave him a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed Oppenheimer \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\", in contrast to Tenet, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.[58][5]\n\nIn December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with Warner Bros. on each of his films since Insomnia (2002), was outraged, as he was a staunch supporter of traditional film exhibition.[59] In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros.[60] By mid-2021, Nolan had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project.[5] Nolan had previously supported Warner Bros.' decision to give Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) a simultaneous release, saying he felt that situation had been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of Tenet.[61][62]\n\nIn September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film about Oppenheimer and his contributions to the Manhattan Project, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.[63][64] Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple.[65][66] According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process due to the replacement of the CEO and chairman, Jim Gianopulos, with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.[66]\n\nNolan signed with Universal because he had previously worked with Donna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television series The Prisoner.[67] Langley agreed with Nolan's stance on traditional film exhibition and Universal agreed to finance and distribute Oppenheimer, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022.[68] Universal also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million,[69] an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the opening, in which Universal could not release another new film.[66][5]\n\n### Writing\n\nNolan became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985).[70] He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[58] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[57] Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and remarked that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[71]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy September 2021, both Roven and Nolan had begun contacting Bird and Sherwin to discuss the script. During Bird's first meeting with Nolan, he had already written a spec script while they discussed the script's content, although Nolan did not disclose the script to them yet.[72] Oppenheimer is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale.[57][73][74] He began developing the script after he completed Tenet and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.[57]\n\nA major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\".[70] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[75] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\".[76][70] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[77] Nolan noted that while Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he still believed Oppenheimer had felt genuine guilt for his actions and thus portrayed him as exhibiting those feelings.[78]\n\nI think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I've made three Batman films, is saying a lot.\n\nNolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.[58] As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate\".[79] Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in Amadeus (1984).[70]\n\nAnother critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[57] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[74] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to present a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".[78]\n\n### Casting\n\nOppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Cillian Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy read extensively on Oppenheimer's life and was inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[80][10][70] Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted, excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room.[81] Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance.[82] Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014).[57] As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.[57]\n\nThe casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on.[37] Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4 million in lieu of their usual $10–20 million upfront salary.[83] Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper.[84] Downey would later describe Oppenheimer as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date.[85] Downey previously met with Nolan for the role of Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow in Batman Begins (2005), but Nolan felt Downey wasn't right for the role, which went to Murphy.[86] Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.[84] Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon—who had appeared in Nolan's Interstellar—was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso in couples therapy, but signed on to Oppenheimer as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film.[87]\n\nNolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in Licorice Pizza (2021).[88] Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.[70] It is Nolan's first film since Insomnia (2002) to not feature Michael Caine.[89] Glen Powell auditioned and was rejected for the role that went to Josh Hartnett.[90] For Harry S. Truman's appearance, Nolan sought his collaborator Gary Oldman, who was on a break from filming the Apple TV+ series Slow Horses (2022–present); Oldman told Nolan that he was contractually obliged to not cut his hair, so either he could play Truman with a prosthetic cap and a wig or get someone else to play the part, which Nolan agreed.[91]\n\n### Filming\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFilming at the  took place in May 2022.\n\nPre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists.[92][93] Another casting call was held in February.[94]\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico,[95] and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer.[82][24] The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for filming.[96] However, during pre-production, it had become clear that principal photography could not be completed within $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States.[96] To efficiently use the budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and constructing high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule from 85 to 57 days.[96][97] Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as \"insane\".[96]\n\nOldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\".[52] The original choice for Oval Office location in the Nixon Presidential Library fell through a week before filming, and since Oldman's dates were unmovable, the production design team redressed the Oval Office set from the HBO series Veep (2012–2019), which according to Ruth De Jong had fallen into \"nightmarish\" disrepair.[98] Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".[58]\n\nCinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema won several awards for his work on Oppenheimer, including an Academy Award.[99]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film.[10] It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film.[100][101] Van Hoytema used 50 mm and 80 mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses.[102] Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography and microphotography to record the miniature effects.[103] Miniatures were filmed with IMAX cameras at 48 frames per second, while miniatures needing higher speed were shot on 35 mm film with an Arriflex 435 ES camera at 150 frames per second.[104][105][106][107] In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[108] Filming also occurred in California,[51] primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.[109] Scenes set in the city of Berkeley itself were filmed in Pasadena.[110]\n\nDuring a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks.[95] Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch.[95] It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days.[95] The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos.[110] Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022.[95] Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos.[95] Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance.[111] The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque's Old Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.[110]\n\nAlthough the news coverage surrounding the film's release implied that most of the film was shot in New Mexico, the official making-of book Unleashing Oppenheimer revealed that many of the film's most important scenes were shot within the studio zone in Los Angeles County. Early on, three days were set aside for filming at UCLA's Kerckhoff Hall, which was used for both the Cambridge and Göttingen scenes.[112] \nThe Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles stood in for the Mark Hopkins Hotel for one of Oppenheimer's encounters with Tatlock, for the Plaza Hotel for Strauss's 1949 birthday celebration,[113] and for an unnamed Washington, D.C. hotel for the scene where Szilard and Hill try to get Oppenheimer to sign a petition against dropping the bomb on Japan.[114]   Oppenheimer's security hearing was shot in Alhambra, California, in a \"disused office building in the former manufacturing headquarters for the petrochemical company C.F. Braun &amp; Co.\"[115] The scene in which Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked was shot on May 19, 2022, the production's last day in Alhambra.[116]\n\nFilming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics.[117] When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb.[5] Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him.[5] The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[5][110] The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[5][110] A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[58] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the special effects supervisor, Scott R. Fisher, referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective.[118][119] Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects,[120] and used practical effects to achieve \"real-world imagery\".[121]\n\nThe last portion of principal photography was for Nolan and van Hoytema to travel to Europe to obtain establishing shots for the early European phase of Oppenheimer's life.  For example, they did not bother with shooting in any actual part of the University of Cambridge; \"van Hoytema simply set up a camera across the river\".[122]  Filming wrapped in May 2022.[123]\n\n### Post-production\n\nEditing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited Tenet.[10] While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed \"character passes\" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters.[70] Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements,[124] marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor,[125] who stated that the film used mostly \"invisible\" visual effects through \"'in-camera' special effects created on set\".[126] Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.[127] There were 160 VFX artists who worked on the film, 134 of whom were left uncredited.[128]\n\nSteven Spielberg was the first person to see the final cut, in a private screening of its first 70mm print. Nolan said: \"He said some very kind things, but really just to watch him watch ... I wasn't even supposed to watch it with him, but seeing the great master watching? It was sort of irresistible.\"[129][130]\n\n## Music\n\nLudwig Göransson won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLudwig Göransson composed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan's previous film, Tenet.[10] Göransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023.[131] It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.[132][133] Nolan had advised him to use a solo violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds\".[70]\n\n## Marketing\n\nOppenheimer's teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29 a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of Nope before being posted online on Universal's social media profiles.[134] Empire commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\".[135]\n\nIn December 2022, two trailers premiered in front of Avatar: The Way of Water, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online.[136][137] In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.[138]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nScreening of Oppenheimer at the BFI IMAX in London\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023,[139] followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[140] and the American premiere at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City on July 17.[141] Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[140] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere.[141] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like Oppenheimer.[142] Oppenheimer was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[10][143] In addition to standard digital cinemas, it was also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[144]\n\nThe film was released on the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was made in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[145] Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences,[146] and how they should be viewed as a double feature.[147] The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\",[148] and was described as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\".[149] Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"[150]\n\nIn March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[151] Oppenheimer had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of \"preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values\".[152]\n\nThe film was not released in Japan until eight months after its initial global release. Variety noted the controversial reputation in Japan due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A Universal spokesperson said that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets\". American films are often released in Japan a few months after the initial theatrical release.[153] In December 2023, the independent Japanese film distributor Bitters End announced that it would theatrically release the film in 2024, as Universal's distributor in Japan Toho-Towa opted not to release it.[154][155] The film was later released by Bitters End in Japan on March 29, and during its first three days, it was ranked as the country's highest grossing foreign film after making 379.3 million yen ($2.5 million) at the box office.[156][157]\n\n#### Classifications and censorship\n\nIn the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\". It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since Insomnia (2002).[158] In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\".[159] In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for \"strong language and sex\", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film.[160] In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.[161][162][163]\n\nIn India, Oppenheimer was released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time.[164]\n\n#### Bhagavad Gita controversy\n\nThe audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", remained intact.[165] As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.[166] Hindu nationalists were angered by the scene and demanded its removal.[167] Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of Oppenheimer across the world.[165] On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj told The Times of India that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation &amp; the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"[168]\n\n### Home media\n\nOppenheimer was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray and DVD formats including digital on November 21, 2023.[169] As the former two releases sold out days after release, Universal worked on restocking before the holiday season.[170] Nolan was vocal during the home release campaign of the film about the importance of physical media libraries, stating that letting films only exist digitally or on streaming services allows companies to have too much control and creates a danger for film preservation.[171][172] The film was released for streaming in the United States exclusively on Peacock and in Canada on Amazon Prime Video on February 16, 2024.[173][174]\nAdditionally, it began streaming on Jio Cinema in India from March 21, 2024.[175]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nOppenheimer grossed $330.1 million in the United States and Canada and $645.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $976 million;[6][7] $190 million of which came from IMAX alone.[176] It is the third-highest-grossing R-rated film of all time behind Joker (2019) and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine (2024).[177][178] In September 2023, Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassing Bohemian Rhapsody (2018).[179][180]\n\nBy August 2023, Oppenheimer had become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, although in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassing Barbie for the first time.[181] It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing Dunkirk (2017), also a Nolan film.[182][183] Additionally, Oppenheimer became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million[184] (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70 mm prints.[185] The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theaters on November 3, including six IMAX 70 mm prints, as these theaters reported selling out during the initial release.[184] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $201.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[186]\n\n#### United States and Canada\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer was released alongside Barbie,[187] in what became known as 'Barbenheimer'. The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day.[188] After grossing $33 million on its first day (including $10.5 million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million,[189] finishing second behind Barbie and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama.[190] 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18–34 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for Oppenheimer), a combined total of 18.5 million people.[191] The opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from The Dark Knight trilogy.[192] It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind The Passion of the Christ (2004) and American Sniper (2014).[193]\n\nOppenheimer made $46.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind Barbie.[194][195] The film made $28.7 million in its third weekend, finishing third behind Barbie and newcomer Meg 2: The Trench.[196] On August 16, Oppenheimer surpassed Sing (2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.[197][198] During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place.[199] In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend.[199] Following its 13 Oscar nominations, the film expanded from 1,008 theaters to 2,262 in its 28th week of release and made $1 million, an increase of 284% from the previous weekend.[200][201]\n\n#### Japan\n\nIn Japan, Oppenheimer was released on March 29, 2024.[202][203] Prior to its release, it attracted controversy there, and Warner Bros. issued an apology following criticism of the Barbenheimer phenomenon as insensitive.[204] Despite the outcry, the film would do very well in Japan, grossing $2.5 million and placing third in the country's box office during its opening weekend.[205][206][207]\n\nThe film received a range of comments from the Japanese public. Some theaters displayed content warnings for the film.[208] A number of people from Hiroshima who viewed the film reported feeling discomfort and distress while watching it.[209] One point of contention was on the choice to not visually depict the nuclear bombing of Japan. A number of Japanese people praised the choice and others felt that it resulted in the downplaying or glorification of the bombing.[209][210][211] Takashi Hiraoka, former mayor of Hiroshima, reportedly felt that the horror of nuclear weapons had not been sufficiently portrayed in the film.[209][210] A number of people reported feeling that Oppenheimer was glorified in the film for his role in developing the bomb, and a number of people felt that he was also a victim of his circumstances and experienced distress from it.[209][211] Masao Tomonaga, who experienced one of the nuclear bombings, felt that the film was \"anti-nuclear\" and expressed disappointment in the lack of a scene for the atomic bombing in Japan, but was reportedly satisfied with the portrayal of Oppenheimer's distress after the bombings.[209] A Hiroshima resident was reported advocating for more people to see the film,[209] and another advocated for fewer.[211]\n\nWhen commenting on Oppenheimer's success in the country, USC School of Cinematic Arts' Vice Dean of Faculty, Akira Mizuta Lippit, stated in an article for Deadline Hollywood in May 2024, \"Previous films about Japan, good and bad, some offensive or ignorant, have nonetheless enjoyed box office success in Japan,\" noting how films like Pearl Harbor and The Last Samurai were \"embraced by Japanese audiences,\" whereas other films like Memoirs of a Geisha were \"a little less so.\"[207]\n\n#### Other territories\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer grossed $98 million in its opening weekend.[212] The following weekend, it earned $77.1 million, dropping by 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey.[213] In its third weekend, Oppenheimer grossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%)[214] and $32 million in its fourth weekend.[215] It held well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[216][217] As of September 10, 2023, the highest-grossing territories were the UK ($75 million), China ($61.6 million), Germany ($51.9 million), France ($43.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[218]\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n, , and  garnered critical acclaim for their performances and earned  nominations for , and  and , with Murphy and Downey Jr. winning.\n\nOppenheimer received critical acclaim.[b] Critics praised the film primarily for its screenplay, cast performances, and visuals.[c] It was frequently ranked as one of Nolan's best films,[233][234][225][d] and one of the best of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[229] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 508 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Oppenheimer marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\"[236] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[237] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[191]\n\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four, describing it as \"magnificent\" and \"one of the best films of the 21st century\".[238] The A.V. Club's Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers and a movie that burns itself into your brain\".[239] Empire's Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography.[240] Peter Suderman, writing for Reason, said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great and terrible. Oppenheimer isn't just a movie—it's a warning.\"[241]\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com, awarded Oppenheimer a full four out of four rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character and its technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, Oppenheimer is something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what and that's what's so fascinating about it\". He also compared the role of the conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein in the film to the role of \"Rosebud\" in Citizen Kane.[242] Peter Travers described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you'll see anywhere\".[243] Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of Memento, Inception and Tenet.[244] IGN critic Siddhant Adlakha ranked Oppenheimer 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan's most \"abstract\" work yet.[245]\n\nIn August 2023, it ranked number three on Collider's list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" with the site writing that Nolan \"explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante  [sic] as an inspiration, Oppenheimer makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again.\"[246]\n\nDespite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment\".[247][248] Owen Gleiberman of  Variety found the film's first half \"mesmerizing\" and \"tick[ing] with cosmic suspense\", but wrote that \"a certain humming intensity leaks out of the movie\" after the Trinity Test sequence, which was itself described as a \"letdown\".[249] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \"a brilliant achievement in formal and conceptual terms\", praising Nolan for capturing \"the kinetic excitement of intellectual discourse\" and comparing the film's complex narrative structure to a \"Cubistic portrait\". However, she found some of the cameos by supporting actors such as Malek \"distracting\", and noted that the film's black-and-white scenes could feel \"overlong\" despite ultimately working in service of Nolan's narrative intentions.[250] In a mixed review, Odie Henderson of The Boston Globe called the film \"visually stunning but emotionally empty\", criticizing Nolan's screenplay for rendering Oppenheimer an \"enigma whose inner life is expressed by gimmicky cuts to scenes of outer space rather than evidence of human emotions.\" Furthermore, Henderson negatively characterized the film's second half as \"an interminable series of scenes set in courtrooms and at congressional hearings\", and felt Pugh and Blunt were \"wasted\" in \"severely underwritten\" roles.[251]\n\nWhile praising how the film acknowledges the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason complained that it omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans who ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\"[252] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying \"representational completists\" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence\".[219]  Chang later won the 2024 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism for that article.[253] Richard Brody of The New Yorker described the film as a \"History Channel movie with fancy editing\" and wrote, \"I was tempted to call it a movie-length Wikipedia article. But after a look online, I realized I was giving Wikipedia too little credit—or Christopher Nolan, the movie's writer and director, too much\".[254]\n\nFor IndieWire's annual critics poll, in which 158 critics and journalists from around the world voted, Oppenheimer was placed second in their Best Film list, with 69 overall mentions and 17 first-place votes. Nolan was also ranked second on the Best Director list, while his screenplay was placed eighth. Murphy was the highest-placed actor on the Best Performance list (fourth overall) while Van Hoytema's work topped the Best Cinematography list.[255] Oppenheimer also appeared in over 410 critics' lists of the best films released in 2023, and was ranked first in 99 of them.[256]\n\nOliver Stone deemed the film \"a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate\".[257] Paul Schrader called Oppenheimer, \"the best, most important film of this century\",[258] while Denis Villeneuve called it \"a masterpiece\".[259] Steven Soderbergh said of the film, \"Oppenheimer is a real accomplishment. I read somewhere that Chris [Nolan] implied that this is the movie he's been building toward, and I think he's right. And I'm thrilled that it's a massive hit.\"[260] Spike Lee also praised the film, calling it a \"great film\", but felt that it should have shown what happened to the Japanese people, given the film's length.[261] Japanese director Takashi Yamazaki said, \"As a person of Japanese ancestry and descent, my response to Oppenheimer [is that] I would like to dedicate a different film to that when that day comes.\"[262] Other filmmakers, including A. V. Rockwell, Joe Dante, Reinaldo Marcus Green, Chad Hartigan, Max Hechtman, Don Hertzfeldt, Matt Johnson, Raine Allen-Miller, James Ponsoldt and Adam Wingard cited it as among their favorite films of 2023.[263][264]\n\nKorean film critic Yim Jeong-sik said \"Oppenheimer depicts the tragedy of the combination of science and politics. Oppenheimer developed the atomic bomb to stop the Nazis from developing nuclear weapons, but the result was the bomb dropped on Japan and countless casualties. The film coldly shows how science loses its purity and becomes a tool of the state through the process of Oppenheimer's choice combining with America's imperial ambitions.\"[265]\n\n### Influence on legislation\n\nThe renewed attention to the Trinity site and associated nuclear testing encouraged the United States Congress to revise the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during the Cold War, known as \"Downwinders\" and primarily consisting of the Navajo Nation. The United States Senate approved amendments to accommodate additional services to people in New Mexico, but it has not passed through Congress as the House of Representatives had not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 fiscal year.[266][needs update]\n\n## Accuracy and omissions\n\nPresident Truman's portrait of the Argentine leader José de San Martín  did not arrive at the White House until 1946, more than a year after his meeting with Oppenheimer.[267][268]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSome scenes in the movie were taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.[269] Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film since he did not know how significant it would become. The study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time and not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\" but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.[269][270]\n\nIt was also pointed out that the incorrect American flag was used. In the film, the current 50-star flag is shown. This version was not adopted until 1960. During the war, the American flag had only 48 stars as Hawaii and Alaska had yet to become states.[271]\n\nThe scene where Oppenheimer poisons his tutor's apple at university is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life.[272] Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day and narrowly preventing it from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple or had any involvement in the incident.[269] Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends,[273] but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened.[269] Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to physicist Karl Compton at MIT, not Einstein.[269] Although the film portrays Groves' aggressive recruitment of Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton at the Metallurgical Laboratory had earlier recruited and appointed Oppenheimer to take over the research into the bomb-design part of what became the Manhattan Project.[274]\n\nAs Strauss correctly points out in the film's dialogue, Oppenheimer never expressed regret for the atomic bombings, but as Chang explained in his Pulitzer Prize-winning article, the true situation not depicted in the film was even worse: Oppenheimer avoided giving an apology when confronted by a reporter during his 1960 visit to Tokyo and Osaka.[219] In addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence as a possible constraint upon the nuclear arms race between the United States and USSR as a \"broader tragedy\" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy, but he called the production \"highly accurate\" otherwise for a Hollywood film.[275]\n\nMany efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites like Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown.[270] Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on understanding and producing the radioactive material that powered the nuclear explosions.[276] In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.[277] The film was criticised for its omission of the 30 Native American families who were forcibly displaced from Los Alamos in 1942 to make space for the experiment.[278]\n\nAnother technical problem accurately represented throughout the film was plutonium production. This can be analyzed through the occurrence of discussions of fizzle, ingenuity, engineering breakthroughs and setbacks, and once again, the determination to succeed. The film focused on the great cost it took to obtain the plutonium, as well as the overall process of breeding plutonium. Enrico Fermi, a main scientist involved in the Manhattan Project, was the one who discovered that plutonium was the element necessary to produce a spontaneous fission reaction.[279] His contributions to the Manhattan Project were not included in the film as much as they were recognized in real-life.\n\nIn the film, a scene depicts the May 31, 1945, meeting of the Interim Committee, which J. Robert Oppenheimer attended as a member of the Scientific Panel of consultants. In this scene, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson is portrayed ordering the removal of Kyoto from the list of top atomic bomb targets, allegedly because it was a favored honeymoon destination for him and his wife. However, historian of science and nuclear weapons, Alex Wellerstein, clarifies that this portrayal is a myth. According to Wellerstein, Stimson's diary from his 1926 travels with his wife does not mention Kyoto, and the only brief visit they made there was in 1929, during a single night stay while on a \"fact-finding\" mission related to his role as Governor-General of the Philippines. The film's depiction overlooks that Stimson's objection to targeting Kyoto was primarily strategic rather than personal. He expressed this viewpoint to President Truman on multiple occasions, including at the Potsdam Conference. Stimson wrote in his diary on July 24, 1945, \"He [Truman] again reiterated with the utmost emphasis his own concurring belief on that subject, and he was particularly emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion that if elimination was not done, the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long post-war period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to the Russians.\"[280][281]\n\n## Accolades\n\nOppenheimer earned a leading 13 nominations at the 96th Academy Awards, becoming Nolan's most Oscar-nominated film.[282][283][284] At the ceremony, the film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Murphy, Best Supporting Actor for Downey Jr., Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score.[285] Besides composer Göransson, all recipients were first-time Oscar winners, including Nolan, Thomas, Roven, Downey Jr. and van Hoytema, who had each earned previous Academy Award nominations.[286] Oppenheimer became both the highest-grossing and longest Best Picture winning film since 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[287] The film was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Blunt, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design, and Best Sound.\n\nThe film won numerous other accolades. It won a leading five Golden Globe Awards, receiving Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director for Nolan, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for Murphy, Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for Downey Jr., and Best Original Score for Göransson at the 81st ceremony.[288][289][290] The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Oppenheimer one of the top-ten films of 2023.[291][292] Oppenheimer received nominations for 13 Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning eight), 13 British Academy Film Awards (winning seven), 14 Saturn Awards (winning four), and four Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning three),[293][294][295] while its score earned three nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards (winning one).[296][297][298]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films about nuclear issues\n- List of World War II films since 1990\n- Oppenheimer, a 1980 TV series about Oppenheimer, portrayed by Sam Waterston\n- Fat Man and Little Boy, 1989 film about the Manhattan Project, starring Paul Newman as General Groves and Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer\n- Day One, 1989 TV film about the Manhattan Project, starring Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strathairn as Oppenheimer\n- Doctor Atomic, a 2005 opera about Oppenheimer, composed by John Adams\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Although in the real life Tatlock's death has officially been ruled a suicide, the film deliberately portrays her death in two ways: in one, she commits suicide, in the other, she is murdered by an unseen assailant\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[219][220][221][222][223][224][225][226][227][228]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[229][230][231][232]\n- ^ Hindustan Times reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century[235]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d Lazic, Elena (July 21, 2023). \"Review: Oppenheimer\".

Robert Oppenheimer</CharacterDepth>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\nOppenheimer is a <Genre>2023 epic biographical thriller</Genre> film written, produced, and directed by <Director>Christopher Nolan</Director>. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film dramatizes Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory, and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nOppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It was Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to join, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, selected scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.\n\nOppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal Pictures. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer received critical acclaim and grossed $976 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all time at the time of its release.\n\nThe recipient of many accolades, Oppenheimer was nominated for thirteen awards at the 96th Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director (<Director>Nolan</Director>), Best Actor (<Name>Murphy</Name>), and Best Supporting Actor (<Name>Downey</Name>). It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.\n\n## Plot\n\nWhile the film is shown in a non-linear format, the following is the chronological order of events that happen in the film.\n\nIn 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of Cambridge in England. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett, leaving him a poisoned apple, but he later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany.\n\nOppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist psychiatrist who later dies in an apparent suicide.\n\nWhen nuclear fission is discovered in 1938, after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis sooner.\n\nOppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could destroy the world; after consulting with Albert Einstein and having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are \"near zero\". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n\nAfter Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development.\n\nAs an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioactive isotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonate their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947, though he had in fact expressed his belief that he had caused a chain reaction that would one day destroy the world.\n\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer's Q clearance, during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a kangaroo court. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty vigorously defends herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but still revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.\n\nIn 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, enraging him. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while incorporating the specified XML tags to highlight the relevant attributes of the movie \"Oppenheimer\".",

Set in 1967,[4] the film stars Michael Stuhlbarg as a Minnesotan Jewish man whose life crumbles both professionally and personally, leading him to questions about his faith.\n\nA Serious Man received widespread positive critical response, including a place on both the American Film Institute's and National Board of Review of Motion Pictures's Top 10 Film Lists of 2009. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, and Stuhlbarg was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Since its release, it has been widely considered one of the Coen brothers' best films and one of the greatest films of the 21st century.[5][6][7][8]\n\n## Plot\n\nA Jewish man in a 19th-century Eastern European shtetl tells his wife that he was helped on his way home by Reb Groshkover, whom he has invited in for soup. She says Groshkover is dead and the man he invited must be a dybbuk. Groshkover arrives and laughs off the accusation, but she plunges an ice pick into his chest. Bleeding, he exits their home into the snowy night.\n\nIn 1967, Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics living in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. His wife, Judith, tells him that she needs a get so she can marry widower Sy Ableman, with whom she has fallen in love. Meanwhile, their son Danny owes twenty dollars to an intimidating Hebrew school classmate for marijuana. He has the money, but it is hidden in a transistor radio that was confiscated by his teacher. Their daughter, Sarah, is always washing her hair, going out and avoiding school. Larry's brother, Arthur, is homeless and sleeps on the couch, spending his free time filling a notebook with what he calls the \"Mentaculus\", a \"probability map of the universe\".\n\nClive Park, a South Korean student worried about losing his scholarship, meets with Larry in his office to argue he should not fail the class. After he leaves, Larry finds an envelope stuffed with cash. When Larry attempts to return it, Clive's father threatens to sue Larry either for defamation if Larry accuses Clive of bribery, or for keeping the money if he does not give him a passing grade. Larry faces an impending vote on his application for tenure, and his department head informs him that anonymous letters have urged the committee to deny him. At the insistence of Judith and Sy, Larry and Arthur move into a nearby motel. Judith empties the couple's bank accounts, leaving Larry penniless, so he enlists the services of a divorce attorney. Larry learns that Arthur faces charges of illegal gambling, solicitation and sodomy.\n\nLarry turns to his Jewish faith for consolation. He consults a junior rabbi, Ginsler, who advises Larry to change his \"perspective\". Larry and Sy are involved in separate, simultaneous car crashes. Larry is unharmed, but Sy dies. Larry consults a second rabbi, Nachtner, for solace, who recounts a parable about a dentist who finds Hebrew inscriptions on a non-Jewish patient's teeth. Larry also tries to contact Marshak, the synagogue's senior rabbi, who isn't available. At Judith's insistence, Larry pays for Sy's funeral. At the funeral, Sy is eulogized as \"a serious man\". Larry calls on his neighbor, Vivienne Samsky, whom he has seen sunbathing naked. She introduces him to marijuana. He later dreams that he is having sex with her, but this turns into a nightmare.\n\nArthur is despondent about the charges levied at him, and Larry consoles him. Larry then has another nightmare in which he gives Arthur the money Clive left him and drives him to cross into Canada by boat, only for his neighbors to shoot Arthur in the neck. Larry is proud and moved by Danny's bar mitzvah, unaware that his son is under the influence of marijuana. During the service, Judith apologizes to Larry for all the recent trouble and informs him that Sy respected him so much that he even wrote letters to the tenure committee. Danny meets with Marshak, a brief encounter in which Marshak only quotes Jefferson Airplane's \"Somebody to Love\", names some members of the band, returns the radio, and tells Danny to \"be a good boy\".\n\nLarry's department head compliments him on Danny's bar mitzvah and hints that he will receive tenure. The mail brings a $3,000 bill from Arthur's lawyer. In order to pay for it, he decides to accept the bribe and gives Clive a passing grade. However, immediately after he does so, his doctor calls, asking to see him immediately about the results of a chest X-ray, saying somberly, that he might want to hear the news in person. Meanwhile, as their teacher struggles to open the emergency shelter, a massive tornado closes in on the school.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Michael Stuhlbarg as Lawrence \"Larry\" Gopnik\n- Richard Kind as Arthur Gopnik\n- Fred Melamed as Sy Ableman\n- Sari Lennick as Judith Gopnik\n- Aaron Wolff as Danny Gopnik\n- Jessica McManus as Sarah Gopnik\n- Alan Mandell as Rabbi Marshak\n- Adam Arkin as Don Milgram\n- George Wyner as Rabbi Nachtner\n- Amy Landecker as Mrs. Vivienne Samsky\n- Peter Breitmayer as Mr. Brandt\n- Brent Braunschweig as Mitch Brandt\n- Katherine Borowitz as Mimi Nudell\n- Allen Lewis Rickman as Velvel\n- Yelena Shmulenson as Dora\n- Fyvush Finkel as Dybbuk?\n- Simon Helberg as Rabbi Scott Ginsler\n- Raye Birk as Dr. Shapiro\n- Michael Lerner as Solomon Schlutz\n- David Kang as Clive\n- Steve Park as Clive's father\n- Ari Hoptman as Arlen Finkle\n- Amanda Day as Art Student\n- Landyn Banx as Actor\n\n## Production\n\nConsiderable attention was paid to the setting; it was important to the Coens to find a neighborhood of original-looking suburban rambler homes as they would have appeared in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, in the late 1960s. Locations were scouted in nearby Edina, Richfield, Brooklyn Center, and Hopkins[9] before a suitable location was found in Bloomington.[10] The film's look is partly based on the Brad Zellar book Suburban World: The Norling Photographs, a collection of photographs of Bloomington in the 1950s and 60s.[11]\n\nLocation filming began on September 8, 2008, in Minnesota. An office scene was shot at Normandale Community College in Bloomington. The film also used a set built in the school's library, as well as small sections of the second floor science building hallway. The synagogue is the B'nai Emet Synagogue in St. Louis Park. The Coens also shot some scenes in St. Olaf College's old science building because of its similar period architecture.[12][13] A classroom scene was shot at the then-closed Shingle Creek Elementary School in north Minneapolis, due to its 1960s-era design.[14] Scenes were also shot at the Minneapolis legal offices of Meshbesher &amp; Spence, the name of whose founder and president, Ronald I. Meshbesher, is mentioned as the criminal lawyer recommended to Larry in the film.[15] Filming wrapped on November 6, 2008, after 44 days, ahead of schedule and within budget.[16]\n\nLongtime collaborator Roger Deakins rejoined the Coens as cinematographer, following his absence from Burn After Reading. This was his tenth film with them.[17] Costume designer Mary Zophres returned for her ninth collaboration with the directors.[17]\n\nThe Coens themselves stated that the \"germ\" of the story was a rabbi from their adolescence: a \"mysterious figure\" who had a private conversation with each student at the conclusion of their religious education.[18] Ethan Coen said that it seemed appropriate to open the film with a Yiddish folk tale, but as the brothers did not know any suitable ones, they wrote their own.[19]\n\nOpen auditions for the roles of Danny and Sarah were held on May 4, 2008, at the Sabes Jewish Community Center in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, one of the scheduled shooting locations. Open auditions for the role of Sarah were also held in June 2008 in Chicago, Illinois.[4][20]\n\nPatton Oswalt and Marc Maron auditioned for the roles of Arthur Gopnik and Larry Gopnik.[21][22]\n\n### Music\n\nAll of the film's original music is by Carter Burwell,[23] who also worked on every previous Coen brothers film except O Brother, Where Art Thou?[24] The film also contains pieces of Yiddish music including \"Dem Milner's Trern\" by Mark Warshawsky and performed by Sidor Belarsky, which deals with the abuse and recurring evictions of Jews from Shtetlekh.[25]\n\nThe soundtrack also includes the following songs by popular 1960s artists:\n\n|   No. | Title                         | Artist             | Length   |\n|-------|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Somebody to Love\"            | Jefferson Airplane | 2:58     |\n|     2 | \"Today\"                       | Jefferson Airplane | 3:02     |\n|     3 | \"Comin' Back to Me\"           | Jefferson Airplane | 5:16     |\n|     4 | \"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\" | Jefferson Airplane | 3:40     |\n|     5 | \"Machine Gun\"                 | Jimi Hendrix       | 12:36    |\n\n## Release and reception\n\nThe film began a limited release in the United States on October 2, 2009. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival[26] on September 12, 2009.[27]\n\n### Box office\n\n| Release date    | Box office revenue    | Box office revenue    | Box office revenue    | Box office ranking     | Box office ranking    | Budget         |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| United States   | United States         | International         | Worldwide             | All time United States | All time worldwide    | Budget         |\n| October 2, 2009 | $9,228,768            | $22,201,566           | $31,430,334           | #3,818                 | Unknown               | $7,000,000[29] |\n\nA Serious Man grossed $9,228,768 domestically, and $22,201,566 internationally, making for a worldwide gross of $31,430,334.[1]\n\n### Critical response\n\nA Serious Man received mostly positive reviews from critics, and holds a 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 227 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Blending dark humor with profoundly personal themes, the Coen brothers deliver what might be their most mature—if not their best—film to date.\"[30] The film also holds a score of 85 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[31]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film four out of four stars. His review highlighted the film's Yiddish folktale prologue, suggesting that though the Coens maintain it has no relation to the rest of the film, \"maybe because an ancestor invited a dybbuk (wandering soul) to cross his threshold, Larry is cursed.\"[32] In an essay in Jung Journal: Culture and Psyche, Steve Zemmelman considers that the prologue may link to the Jefferson Airplane soundtrack motif, reflecting Larry's normal sense of order becoming increasingly disrupted. He writes, \"what can happen when 'the wheel falls off the cart', as Velvel says happened to him on the road that night, or 'when the truth is found to be lies', that lyric from 'Somebody to Love' that serves as bookends for this film.\"[33]\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today wrote, \"A Serious Man is a wonderfully odd, bleakly comic and thoroughly engrossing film. Underlying the grim humor are serious questions about faith, family, mortality and misfortune.\"[34] Time magazine critic Richard Corliss called it \"disquieting\" and \"haunting\".[35]\n\nSome critics, including Roger Ebert, commented on the link between the film and the Biblical Book of Job.[32] K. L. Evans wrote, \"we identify it as a Job story because its central character is tormented by his failure to account for the miseries that befall him\".[36] In his essay \"Job of Suburbia?\", David Tollerton wrote, \"the more substantial connection between A Serious Man and the Book of Job—the connection that reaches deeper—is their similarly absurd presentations of the human struggle with anguish and the divine.\"[37] Slate magazine critic Juliet Lapidos considered that the folktale prologue may be an endorsement of the \"gumption\" of \"taking matters into her own hands\".[38]\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern disliked what he saw as the film's misanthropy, saying that \"their caricatures range from dislikable through despicable, with not a smidgeon of humanity to redeem them.\"[39] David Denby of The New Yorker enjoyed the film's look and feel, but found fault with the script and characterization: \"A Serious Man, like Burn After Reading, is in their bleak, black, belittling mode, and it's hell to sit through ... As a piece of movie-making craft, A Serious Man is fascinating; in every other way, it's intolerable.\"[40] Zemmelman wrote that this kind of viewer response results from the film's lack of narrative resolution: \"The film is perplexing and the dialogue reminds the viewer repeatedly that we are in an encounter with the ever-conflictual and the infinitely mysterious.\"[41]\n\nTodd McCarthy said, \"A Serious Man is the kind of picture you get to make after you've won an Oscar.\"[42] Ebert quoted McCarthy in his review: \"'This is the kind of picture you get to make after you've won an Oscar,' writes Todd McCarthy in Variety. I cannot improve on that.\"[32]\n\nAwarding the film five stars in The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, \"this strange and wonderful film is rounded off with a gloriously well-crafted apocalyptic vision and a chilling intimation of divine retribution for earthly wrongdoing. The Coens have finished the noughties as America's preeminent filmmakers\".[43]\n\nA Serious Man was later voted the 82nd-greatest film since 2000 in a BBC international critics' poll.[44]\n\n### Accolades\n\nA Serious Man received numerous awards and nominations,[45] particularly for its screenplay, acting, and cinematography. Joel and Ethan Coen were awarded Best Original Screenplay at the 2009 National Board of Review Awards[46] and the 2010 National Society of Film Critics Awards.[47] The screenplay was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 2010 Academy Awards,[48] and received nominations from the Writers Guild of America Awards,[49] the BAFTA Awards,[50] the 15th Annual Critics' Choice Awards,[51] and the 2009 Boston Society of Film Critics Awards.[52]\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards;[48] the BBC News called it \"one of the less talked about nominees\".[53] It was also nominated for Best Picture by the Critics' Choice Awards,[51] the Boston Society of Film Critics,[52] and the Chicago Film Critics Association.[54] The National Board of Review,[46] the American Film Institute,[55] the Satellite Awards,[56] and the Southeastern Film Critics Association Awards[57] all listed the film as one of the ten best of 2009.\n\nStuhlbarg was awarded the Chaplin Virtuoso Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival[58] and was nominated for Best Actor at the 2010 Golden Globe Awards.[59] Stuhlbarg, Kind, Melamed and Lennick were nominated for a Gotham Award for Best Performance by an Ensemble Cast.[60] At the 2010 Independent Spirit Awards, Roger Deakins won the award for Best Cinematography, and the film's directors, ensemble cast, and casting directors were awarded with the Robert Altman Award.[61]\n\nDeakins also received awards at both the 2009 Hollywood Awards and the 2009 San Francisco Film Critics Circle Awards,[62] along with the Nikola Tesla Award[63] at the Satellite Awards.[56]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ the pseudonym the Coen brothers use as editors.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d \"A Serious Man\".

It stars Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two London-based Irish hitmen hiding in Bruges, with Ralph Fiennes as their boss. The film is set and was filmed in Bruges, Belgium.[5][6]\n\nIn Bruges was the opening night film of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival[7] and opened in limited release in the United States on 8 February 2008. It garnered a box office of $34.5 million.\n\nFor his performance in the film, Farrell won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, while Gleeson was nominated in the same category.[8] McDonagh won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay[9] and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[10]\n\n## Plot\n\nCarrying out orders, inexperienced hitman Ray shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a young boy standing behind him. He and his mentor Ken are sent to hide in Bruges by their boss Harry, where they are to sightsee and await further instruction. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it.\n\nThey chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chloë, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple over smoking indoors and punches them. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the small-time criminal and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chloë admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chloë drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chloë's stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites.\n\nHarry calls Ken and reveals that the trip was an attempt to give Ray a good experience before he dies. He orders Ken to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken phones Harry to tell him the truth, and Harry immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun and a box of dumdum bullets at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention.\n\nRay's train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chloë bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Meanwhile, Harry spots Ken at a café. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray.\n\nMeanwhile, Eirik crosses the market square and sees Ray and Chloë on a date. He rushes up the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the stairs. Ken tries to disarm Harry, but he is mortally shot in the neck as Harry rushes to the square. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower, and accepts he must jump to save Ray. The warning works, and Ken warns Ray with his dying breath, but his gun is broken during the fall, forcing Ray back to the hotel to retrieve his own.\n\nHarry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray jumps onto a passing barge, but loses Eirik's gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray stumbles into the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray with the dumdum bullets. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried through the movie set and watches the other characters pass by (Chloë, Marie and Eirik) as he is loaded into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die. His fate is left ambiguous.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Colin Farrell as Ray\n- Brendan Gleeson as Ken Daley\n- Ralph Fiennes as Harry Waters\n- Clémence Poésy as Chloë Villette\n- Jordan Prentice as Jimmy\n- Thekla Reuten as Marie\n- Jérémie Renier as Eirik\n- Anna Madeley as Denise\n- Elizabeth Berrington as Natalie Waters\n- Eric Godon as Yuri\n- Željko Ivanek as Canadian Man\n- Ciarán Hinds as Priest (uncredited)\n\n## Cultural references\n\nThe plot has similarities to Harold Pinter's 1957 one-act play The Dumb Waiter.[11] The film also contains many references to the 1973 Nicolas Roeg film Don't Look Now,[12] including the claim by Chloë that the film-within-a-film is almost an homage to it.\n\nWhen they visit the church, the organist begins playing Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 84%, based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Featuring witty dialogue and deft performances, In Bruges is an effective mix of dark comedy and crime thriller elements.\"[21] Metacritic gives the film an average score of 67 out of 100, based on 34 critics, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\".[22]\n\nChicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"This film debut by the theater writer and director Martin McDonagh is an endlessly surprising, very dark, human comedy, with a plot that cannot be foreseen but only relished.\"[23] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film an \"A−\", praising the performances of the main cast: \"Farrell, having successfully made the transition from overexposed-yet-underutilized action-thriller star to one-film-a-year artiste, gets a lot to work with, and he sells it all flawlessly, moving convincingly from offhanded, prickly asshole mode to nervous young lover to disintegrating martyr,\" and that \"then again, all the leads are perfectly cast, and they help turn a light farce with thriller overtones into something deeper and sweeter.\" About the film itself, she added: \"When it's funny, it's hilarious; when it's serious, it's powerful; and either way, it's an endless pleasant surprise.\"[24] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four and praised the two leads, stating that \"Brendan Gleeson is brilliant as Ken … along with his partner in crime, Ray, played by Colin Farrell in probably his best performance.\" About the film, she added that it's \"sharply written, superbly acted, funny and even occasionally touching.\"[25] Damon Wise of Empire magazine gave the film four out of five stars, writing that \"with In Bruges, the British gangster movie gets a Croydon facelift. It may not be new, but it's a wonderfully fresh take on a familiar genre: fucked-up, far-out and very, very funny.\"[26]\n\nJohn Anderson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, writing that \"those who know McDonagh's work know a vein of darkness will run deeply through the comedy. It has seldom been darker. Or funnier. He has made a hit-man movie in which you don't know what will happen and can't wait to find out. Every movie should be so clichéd.\"[27] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave the film a positive review; he praised Farrell's performance, stating that \"in the past few months, with Cassandra's Dream and now this, we've found out something about Farrell. He's not a matinee idol, and he's not a suave or heroic leading man. He's a terrific character actor, and he can go to low places that suave heroes can't risk, like anguish, self-hatred, embarrassment, utter confusion and buffoonery.\" About the film, he added that it's \"witty and lively, with a soul to it, as well.\"[28] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine also praised the performances of the two leads: \"Farrell, who just played a remarkably similar tortured killer for hire in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, finds just the right tone for this twitchy, funny, emotionally volatile thug; for once, he seems to know exactly what movie he's in. So does Brendan Gleeson, the big, shambling, sad-eyed Irish actor known to American audiences mainly for his role in the last two Harry Potter movies.\" She continued about the film: \"A jolly mess of a movie. Overplotted, choppy, and contrived, it nonetheless has a curious vitality that makes you wonder where McDonagh will go next.\"[29] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that \"the acting is top-notch. Colin Farrell, who seems to be gravitating increasingly toward smaller films, effectively channels his manic energy. He and Brendan Gleeson display chemistry in the Odd Couple vein, occasionally giving rise to instances of humor. Ralph Fiennes plays one of the most twisted roles of his career.\"[30]\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"C+\", indicating a mixed review; she praised McDonagh's directing, stating that \"he's a specialist in constructing satisfying, live-wire dramas of violence that crash up against despair, in upending his characters' miseries with moments of twisted humor, and in sustaining a writing voice that roars with a particularly Irish robustness of obscenity.\" She also added that \"neither star is sloppy, but both are loose and mellow—a couple of pros who know they're the whole show.\"[31] Ella Taylor of Village Voice also gave the film a mixed review, stating that \"Bruges may be the movie's rather too-long-running joke, but Farrell's shaggy brow is easily the most entertaining thing in Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's first foray into the crime caper.\"[32]\n\n### Accolades\n\nIn Bruges was nominated for seven awards by the British Independent Film Awards,[33] including the Douglas Hickox Award (Debut Director), Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film and Best Screenplay, the latter of which it won.[34] It was also nominated for two Satellite Awards: for Best Actor (Brendan Gleeson) and Best Film.[35]\n\nIn November 2008, Martin McDonagh won the Irish Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild (IPSG) award for Best Film Script for the film.[36]\n\nThe film was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and both Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell were nominated for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy,[37] which Farrell won at the 66th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, broadcast on 11 January 2009.[38] McDonagh won the Best Original Screenplay award at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards in February 2009.[39]\n\nThe film was nominated for the Best Original Screenplay award at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, but lost to Milk.[40] In the same year, it won the Best International Film award at the 6th Irish Film &amp; Television Awards.[41]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD in Region 1 on 24 June 2008; region 2 on 11 August 2008; and Region 4 on 21 January 2009.[42] It was also released on Blu-ray on 27 January 2009; and in region 1 on 13 July 2010.[42] On 27 September 2022, Kino Lorber re-released the film in 4K Ultra HD.[43]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of cult films\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"In Bruges (18)\".

He and his mentor Ken are sent to hide in Bruges by their boss Harry, where they are to sightsee and await further instruction. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chloë, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple over smoking indoors and punches them. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the small-time criminal and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chloë admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chloë drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chloë's stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites. Harry calls Ken and reveals that the trip was an attempt to give Ray a good experience before he dies. He orders Ken to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken phones Harry to tell him the truth, and Harry immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun and a box of dumdum bullets at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention. Ray's train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chloë bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Meanwhile, Harry spots Ken at a café. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Meanwhile, Eirik crosses the market square and sees Ray and Chloë on a date. He rushes up the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the stairs. Ken tries to disarm Harry, but he is mortally shot in the neck as Harry rushes to the square. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower, and accepts he must jump to save Ray. The warning works, and Ken warns Ray with his dying breath, but his gun is broken during the fall, forcing Ray back to the hotel to retrieve his own. Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray jumps onto a passing barge, but loses Eirik's gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray stumbles into the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray with the dumdum bullets. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried through the movie set and watches the other characters pass by (Chloë, Marie and Eirik) as he is loaded into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die. His fate is left ambiguous.\",\n            \"Cast\": [\n                {\"Colin Farrell\": \"Ray\"},\n                {\"Brendan Gleeson\": \"Ken Daley\"},\n                {\"Ralph Fiennes\": \"Harry Waters\"},\n                {\"Clémence Poésy\": \"Chloë Villette\"},\n                {\"Jordan Prentice\": \"Jimmy\"},\n                {\"Thekla Reuten\": \"Marie\"},\n                {\"Jérémie Renier\": \"Eirik\"},\n                {\"Anna Madeley\": \"Denise\"},\n                {\"Elizabeth Berrington\": \"Natalie Waters\"},\n                {\"Eric Godon\": \"Yuri\"},\n                {\"Željko Ivanek\": \"Canadian Man\"},\n                {\"Ciarán Hinds\": \"Priest (uncredited)\"}\n            ],\n            \"CulturalReferences\": \"The plot has similarities to Harold Pinter's 1957 one-act play The Dumb Waiter.

His actions were entirely improvised. Due to the historical past of the building where the scene took place, the toilet was considered \"historical.\" Joaquin had no intentions to break the toilet, nor did he think it was possible.\n\n- GoofsIn the \"pacing\" scene, as Quell goes from wooden paneled wall to window and back, the second time he goes to he wooden paneling, he breaks out a panel when he pounds it with rage. In the numerous successive shots, the wood panel is restored.\n\n- QuotesLancaster Dodd: If you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let the rest of us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world.\n\n- Crazy creditsAfter its title, this film has no further opening credits.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Conspiracy: The Hollywood Syndicate (2015)\n\n- SoundtracksBaton Sparks\nFrom '48 Reponses to Polymorphia'\nWritten by Jonny Greenwood\nPerformed by The Aukso Chamber Orchestra\nCourtesy of Unreliable Ltd.\n\n### User reviews608\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Capital \"A\" Acting\n\nI had no clue what I was heading into when I pressed play. I think it's really hard to make a bad movie when you have Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jaoquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, and Jesse Plemons leading the charge. Hoffman and Phoenix are fully absorbed into their characters and the film forces its audience to try and follow these conversations that somehow feel super grounded (due to Hoffman's amazing delivery) and unsettling at the same time. This movie really could not have worked without the talent of these actors.\n\nAmy Adams does so much with so little screen time; I do wish we got more time with her but I think her lack of presence contributes to the messaging of the film. She gives an extremely pulled back/subtle performance of a woman that is truly in the middle of the storm.\n\nThis feels fresh and distinct from any other movie I've watched, so I'd definitely recommend it.\n\n- ralphcorbelle\n- Dec 3, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ21\n\n- How long is The Master?Powered by Alexa\n- What is the score at the start of the movie on the beach?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - November 8, 2012 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Filipino\n- Also known as\n    - The Master: Todo Hombre Necesita Un Guía\n- Filming locations\n    - Mare Island, Vallejo, California, USA(as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and various houses, a park and the docks)\n- Production companies\n    - The Weinstein Company\n    - Ghoulardi Film Company\n    - Annapurna Pictures\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $32,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $16,377,274\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $736,311\n    - Sep 16, 2012\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $28,288,071\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 18 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Datasat\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - 70 mm 6-Track\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I glossed over it in the past because it was known as his weakest movie, and only decided to watch it days ago. WHAT. THE. HELL. I wrote that for two reasons. One: this is a fantastic movie with great performances, an eerie score and hauntingly beautiful imagery. Two: It has to be the most confusing film I have ever seen, and that is a hard bar to surpass considering what my brain has witnessed. Enemy is almost like if Only God Forgives focused less on violence and more on interesting characters while providing all the necessary visual storytelling. It combines both scarring visuals with a narrative that’s too rarely seen in cinema. Despite not being his greatest movie, it certainly is not his worst, and I’d even go as far as to call it a masterpiece. Then again, basically all of Villeneuve’s films are. This film is too much for just a simple review, and calls for an in-depth analysis.\n\nTo start this whole thing off, I’d like to make a note that I’ve never done before. Previous analyzed articles that I’ve done have all been open to interpretation. Take Portrait of a Lady on Fire…Me explaining that film was strictly opinion and not fact. On the other hand, with Enemy, there are correct and incorrect interpretations. Buckle up and saddle up readers, because this film is truly bonkers. According to Chris Stuckmann’s analysis, many different articles have tried to analyze this movie with complete failure, claiming that spiders were taking over the world and that Jake Gyllenhaal’s character has an identical twin. WRONG! I will elaborate more on this later, but the two Gyllenhaals in the film are the exact same person. Again, more on this soon. Let’s start with a quote from director Denis Villeneuve, who actually provided his thoughts on explaining the film. In two interviews, the filmmaker explained that this is a documentary of sorts about the main character’s subconscious, to which I completely agree with. The entire movie is not about a doppelgänger, but an all-out war between two halves of the character’s subconscious. Take note that this came from the mouth of the man who made the film, and not solely from myself. The real question is: What would cause Jake’s character to start a battle with his own mind, and what’s going on with that spider imagery? It’s time to dive in.\n\nJust so readers didn’t realize, there are two versions of Jake in this movie, a history teacher, and an actor. From now on, I will differentiate the two by calling them Nerdy Jake and Fancy Pants Jake. All caught up? Good. While watching, it’s reasonably simple to tell the difference between the two Jakes. Nerdy Jake always appears unkempt, messy and wearing cheap clothing. In direct contrast to this, Fancy Pants Jake has on expensive clothes, his general appearance is tidy, clean and he wears a wedding ring.  Enemy opens with a voiceover from Jake’s mother (Isabella Rossellini), who sounds concerned about the state of his apartment, and it’s clear she’s saying this from a voicemail. We then quickly cut to Helen Bell (Sarah Gadon) nude and pregnant before the words “Chaos is order yet undeciphered” appear on screen, a quote from the source material of the movie. Another cut to black brings audiences to seeing Fancy Pants Jake holding a key entering a seedy sex club of some kind as men watch women pleasure themselves off camera in total silence. He then watches another woman present a large spider on a platter before moving her high heels towards it, seemingly ready to squash it. However, we cut to black before anything happens. Next, we see Nerdy Jake teaching his class. His first words are, “Control. It’s all about control.” This is before he begins to discuss dictatorships and how they censor any means of individual expression. This is important for the end of this article, so keep that sentence in mind. He then says, “And it’s important to remember this, that this is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history.” That quote is also severely essential to what happens later on, but unfortunately, you’ll have to keep reading this madness.  Next, he states, “It was Hegel that said that all the greatest world events happen twice, and then Karl Marx added: the first time it was a tragedy, the second time it was a farce.”\n\nContinuing to show us ambiguous, spidery imagery are shots of the wires above Toronto, which appear just like spider webs. As Nerdy Jake walks through a tunnel back to his apartment, he sees a mural of a man presenting a Roman fascist symbol. Keep in mind that defiance against rule, dictatorships and fear of commitment are all prominent themes in the movie. Enemy has these topics woven throughout its odd core, and it has the perfect blend of both dialogue and visuals to convey this. The next few scenes make it obvious that Nerdy Jake’s life is largely repetitious. He teaches lectures that seem memorized, sleeps with his girlfriend, Mary (Melanie Laurent) and his apartment is quite literally devoid of anything. All the man seems to have is a bed and a computer. Soon later, a co-worker recommends a film to him out of nowhere, without any lead-up or a real conversation that has any relationship with this. Nerdy Jake decides to rent the movie at a local store. It took me a few times to decipher the hidden meaning of this scene, but I realized that the song playing in the background, dubbed “The Cheater”, does have significance to the story. The lyrics are telling the tale of a man who has absolutely no business being with women because he simply cannot control his urges to sleep around, or cheat. After watching the film, he attempts to have sex with his unwilling girlfriend, forcing himself on her without success before falling asleep. In the depths of his mind, he recalls the movie he just saw, and notices a person who looks exactly like him. He suddenly wakes up and quickly skims through the film to see if all of this is real, and he finds him. It’s a literal copy of Nerdy Jake, and it’s completely mind-boggling for the character. He will soon become obsessed with meeting this actor.\n\nHe then compares a noticeably torn photograph of himself with the actor, or Fancy Pants Jake, with likely a post break-up picture, confirming that they are identical. Nerdy Jake then begins to do research about the actor, finding more films he’s had a part in. When he goes to rent the other movies, notice the movie poster in the background with the title Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. This then leads him to the talent agency of Fancy Pants Jake where he has a conversation with the security guard, who immediately recognizes him. The guard says, “You haven’t been around here for ages.” Nerdy Jake goes along with the conversation, and responds with: “Yeah, I don’t know how long it’s been.” The guard then states, “Six months I’d say.” Take note of the amount of time that the guard assumes he’s been away, as it’s important for later. I know I’m leaving readers with unanswered questions, but I do promise everything will be explained later. After, he is given a package meant for Fancy Pants Jake, and finds his address and phone number. However, when he tries to call, Fancy Pants Jake’s wife, Helen, answers the phone instead. She recognizes his voice (because him and Fancy Jake are the same person) thinking that Nerdy Jake is her husband. Following a series of awkward calls, Nerdy Jake eventually reaches Fancy Pants Jake and attempts to convince him that they need to meet.\n\nIt’s only now that we fully meet Fancy Pants Jake and see what the gist of his life is like. He’s healthy, wears nice clothes, loves blueberries, and his wife is almost unfairly suspicious that he’s cheating on her. She even questions him about the phone call he just had with Nerdy Jake and accusing him of lying about the person on the other end, claiming that it was a woman. She asks, “Are you seeing her again?” This implies that Fancy Pants Jake has cheated on her in the past. Naturally, he goes ballistic on her, screaming that it was a man. So although Fancy Pants Jake is living a better life overall, he’s dealing with the fear of commitment to women, similar to that song playing in the film rental store. It clearly makes him feel that his freedom has been removed by his pregnant wife, almost feeling controlled by the scenario. Reverting back to the “cheating in the past” point, this explains why Fancy Pants Jake was in that sex club at the beginning of the movie. He’s terrified of the responsibility of starting a family and staying with one woman in a committed relationship. To understand this theme is vital to comprehending the movie itself, prominently the spiders. Then, Nerdy Jake and Fancy Pants Jake agree to meet at a hotel room, suddenly feeling that they have a need to see each other. Helen appears at Nerdy Jake’s school, and her look upon seeing him is of extreme pain and sadness. Sure it’d be odd to see an identical man to your husband, but what’s with the overreaction? Nerdy Jake asks her, “How many months are you?” She explains that she is six months pregnant. HAH! Coincidence? I think NOT. Remember when the security guard said he was gone from the talent agency for six months? Well that’s the exact same time period when compared to the amount of months Helen was pregnant. This obviously backs up my point about Fancy Pants Jake’s feelings of captivity in his current marriage. He hasn’t even been to his talent agency since his wife got pregnant. He is dictated by a woman and child. The next moment could simply be a coincidence, but it does leave me to wonder. It’s when Helen picks up her phone to call Fancy Pants Jake, and right before Nerdy Jake walks out of the frame, he picks up his phone. This would re-affirm the director’s thoughts on the two being the same person.\n\nLater, when Helen is sitting on the couch at home, Fancy Pants Jake returns from a run…Supposedly. He complains they are out of his favorite organic blueberries. She can’t say anything, simply staying in her position, afraid and depressed before explaining that the man she saw at the school looked exactly like Fancy Pants Jake. She even says, “What’s happening?” When he explains that he is oblivious to what she is talking about, she responds with, “I think you know.” She is slowly but surely discovering that her husband’s mind has split, desiring for him to come to terms with the fact that this has happened. This is why she appears in such emotional distress. This is when we get one of the more haunting spider visions. It shows Fancy Pants Jake walking down a hallway as a woman with a spider head passes by him casually. This is after his wife questioned him about his motives and tried to get him to explain everything to her. Almost identically, we cut to Nerdy Jake standing in a similar hallway as we see two shots of a scantily dressed woman resembling the spider lady. Next, after all of this gorgeously constructed, brilliant set-up, the two finally meet. The two initially compare themselves, noticing that they have an identical scar on each other’s chests. Nerdy Jake leaves out of pure terror, but he gives the talent agency package to Fancy Pants Jake shortly before. The next two shots are also parallels of sorts, focusing on the two dealing with this situation, and after something inside him cracks, Fancy Pants Jake decides to follow Nerdy Jake. He takes notice of Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend, and follows her as well. You may be questioning how would Fancy Pants Jake know how to find the other one? Isn’t it obvious? I mean they share the same damn conscious so I bet it’s quite simple. While on the train following Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend, Fancy Pants Jake has a quick moment in which he ogles at her head-to-toe. He quickly turns around trying to deal with the temptation of sleeping around. He has obvious issues with being faithful to his wife. Before anything else happens, the scene ends with a shot of Fancy Pants Jake in deep thought in his apartment, sitting on a chair. Did he dream that entire scenario up? Was he roaming the depths of his mind attempting to learn about the other version of himself? Perhaps.\n\nNerdy Jake visits his mother, explaining this precarious situation to her. His mother simply says, “The last thing you need is to be meeting strange men in hotels. You have enough trouble sticking with one woman don’t you do this.” This, once again, adds to my assumption (and fact) that Jake overall, as one person, has trouble being faithful to women. His mother offers him some blueberries to which he reluctantly rejects, stating that he doesn’t like them. “Of course you do,” his mother says. Although it may seem quite vague, it seems like Nerdy Jake is attempting to forget the memories of his other self, Fancy Pants Jake, seemingly repressing them. She explains that he has a nice apartment, a respectable job, and that he should quit his fantasy of being an actor. WHAT!!?? Isn’t this Nerdy Jake, the history teacher? Not Fancy Pants Jake, the actor? No, you fools! THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON. That’s not it, though. If you recall that in the beginning of the movie his mother actually states that she doesn’t like the state of his apartment, but now she is suddenly saying it’s nice. Since she also said that he has a respectable job and should quit his acting fantasy, this has lead me to assume that his acting job has gone no where. The small roles he was in didn’t amount to anything, and he never got that one breakout performance. So he’s just a history teacher, right? The fact that his mother said this could also be related to the fact that Helen explained that she went to his work. This concludes that Helen was just realizing the true magnitude of her husband’s psychosis, desperately trying to connect with him, to try and help him by going along with his mental illness. Possibly one of my favorite shots of all-time then appears, and it adds to the crazy spider imagery. We get a wide, beautiful shot tinted with the movie’s yellow-green color palette that’s almost nauseating. It shows a giant, otherworldly spider roaming Toronto, which has also left many people perplexed, as it did for me. No, spiders are still not taking over the world. I’ll explain more later.\n\nNext is the scene that further confirms Jake Gyllenhaal should have won the Oscar in 2013. Seriously, this man was in Enemy and Prisoners in the same year  and didn’t even get nominated. Up yours, Academy. It showcases Fancy Pants Jake practicing a question that he’s going to ask Nerdy Jake in the mirror with himself. He’s asking in the mirror over and over again if he’s had sex with his wife. Yeah, out of the blue. Fancy Pants Jake then actually confronts Nerdy Jake and asks him, “Did you f…k my wife?” In one of the most iconic moments of the film. He does this again and again, but Nerdy Jake can’t even bring himself to say anything. A heated argument ensues and a deal is made. Fancy Pants Jake will take Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend on a romantic get-away, sleep with her, and call it even, disappearing from his life forever. At least I believe that he’s intentionally starting a war with his subconscious so he can eliminate the negative parts and be with his wife forever.  Nerdy Jake decides to go to Fancy Pants Jake’s wife as this battle occurs in his mind. I believe that this is the real-life Jake, the one who has gone back to see his wife. This is while the narcissistic, unfaithful Jake takes another woman out to have sex. The real Jake gets the doorman to let him in to the apartment door. The doorman just so happens to be a man who was in the club at the beginning. He mentions to Nerdy Jake that he wants to go back to this club, and explains that the lock for the place has changed, stating that new keys have been sent out. Since Nerdy Jake doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he just goes along with the conversation. When the doorman lets Nerdy Jake in, he seems to be discovering things in the apartment for the first time as he attempts to resemble Fancy Pants Jake. Nerdy Jake then notices a photograph, and it’s the same one from his apartment, except not torn. It shows himself with his wife. When Helen arrives home he continues to nervously try and become Fancy Pants Jake. During this, we cut to Fancy Pants Jake with Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend entering their hotel room. We cut back to Nerdy Jake getting into bed with Helen, nervous about taking his clothes off. She looks at him with desire and places his hand on her pregnant belly, seemingly reminding him of his responsibility. Remember, she is desperately trying to figure out her husband’s mental dilemma. The next bit is really important as she asks if he had a good day at school. This adds to my other assumption about her knowing that he is really a history teacher, explaining why his mother said he has a respectable job.\n\nMeanwhile, Fancy Pants Jake and his other self’s girlfriend are in the middle of having sex when she notices something. He has a wedding ring mark on his finger. She gets extremely upset and immediately jumps out of bed, flustered by the discovery. Weirdly, Nerdy Jake wakes up at that exact moment, with Fancy Pants Jake’s wife sleeping by his side. Quickly, we cut back to Fancy Pants Jake and Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend, who suddenly wants nothing to do with him. They are driving on their way back to Toronto and a terrible argument begins. This is spliced with scenes of Nerdy Jake walking back and forth before eventually crying. His wife comforts him, and their hands interlock as he says through tears that he’s sorry. During this, Melanie Lauren’t character and Fancy Pants Jake continue arguing, but back in Toronto, his wife tells Nerdy Jake that she wants him to stay as they embrace on the couch, kissing. Fancy Pants Jake and Melanie’s argument gets worse with her insulting him, claiming that he’s not a real man. This truly makes Fancy Pants Jake snap and he swerves the car, crashing it in violent fashion. We get more spider imagery when the camera zooms on the cracked window of the car, representing a spider web. I feel that in this moment Jake has successfully used his subconscious war with himself to effectively eliminate the negative self.  The next morning, we hear a radio broadcast explaining the car crash incident. Since Fancy Pants Jake, or the negative side of this character, has been killed, I will refer to Nerdy Jake as simply Jake. Jake turns off the radio while his wife is in the shower. He finally opens the talent agency package that’s been shown throughout the film. In it, there is a key to the club. He stares at it with a look of temptation and lust, still struggling to resist the urge of being unfaithful despite eliminating Fancy Pants Jake. His wife says his mother called as he continues to stare at the key. He asks if she has anything to do tonight because he has to “go out”. This clearly implies that he wants to go back to the club, unfaithful once again. Some people have called this the scariest ending of all-time in cinema. It’s after Helen doesn’t answer and Jake goes into the room where she’s in. A massive spider suddenly crawls up in the corner of the room in fear and anxiety, squeaking in terror at Jake’s presence. Right! Readers still don’t know what all this spider imagery means! Time to finally spill the beans.\n\nThis ending had audiences screaming three words…What the f..k!!?? And I get it, I had a similar reaction. But there is a real meaning behind the conclusion. The spiders in the film represent women. I mean, at least in the ways that Jake views women. In the real world, spiders entrap their prey in their webs, entangling them. Oftentimes when mating, the female spider actually kills the male one right after and occasionally even before they mate. The film is basically saying that Jake’s character has been devoured, lost his freedom in the spiders that are the women in his life, trapped in the web that is his marriage. The references to dictatorship and being unwillingly ruled obviously has to do with Jake feeling this way about the responsibility of having a child and being faithful to his wife. In the beginning of the movie, Fancy Pants Jake watches a woman about to squash a spider at a sex club. Principally, through his unfaithfulness, he almost longs to “squash” his wife. Metaphorically, of course. This is why he goes somewhere where love doesn’t exist, where men can watch their fantasies being acted out for them, free of responsibility. The woman in the hallway with the spider head supports this, and the scantily clad one that Nerdy Jake sees resembles that woman. But what about the giant one roaming Toronto? The scene took place seconds after he met with his mother, so it’s only reasonable to assume that this spider represents his mother. Then, of course, there’s the final spider in the closing scene. Why did his wife turn into a massive spider? And why did such a big creature react in fear? And why was his look after he sees the spider almost one of acceptive disappointment and not shock? It was almost like he has come to terms with what his life is now like. Going back a bit, when Jake finds the new key to the club, he gets a look of temptation on his face, an urge to watch his deepest desires. He immediately decides that he’s going that very night, and when his wife is revealed to be a spider, she backs up quickly in fear of “getting squashed”. In other terms, his general unfaithfulness and lack of responsibility towards their relationship. This is why Jake is watching a woman squash a spider, because that’s what he really wants…To kill true love. After having eliminated his unfaithful side of himself, but at the first sign of temptation, he gives in with no extra thought. He goes back to his adulterous ways, which explains why his wife reacted in terror. Jake is the spider killer, not being able to control his urges and commit to a healthy relationship. He gives in too easily to sleeping with other women, and that prevents him from having a good life with his wife, or to the eventual family that he will have.  He views all of this as a dictatorship, which we know is something that he is defiant to. The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman poster, along with the song “The Cheater”, and his torn photo of him and his wife all support his fear of women, unfaithfulness, and attempts to ruin his marriage.\n\nThen there’s that look of acceptive disappointment on his face. Remember when I pointed out that Nerdy Jake explained that “This is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history.” It may seem like a stretch, but I believe that Jake is realizing that he’s starting the same pattern again despite having eliminated the negative portion of himself. Repeating his mistakes almost instantly after the first sign of temptation. Intriguingly, the film truly ends with him missing a call from his mother, and begins with the voicemail of the call. Take note that earlier in the movie, Nerdy Jake pointed out that Hegel said something about all of history’s greatest events happening twice, and that Karl Marx explained that the first time it was a tragedy and the second time it was a farce. I believe that after him getting over his adultery, he realizes that this repeating process is going to become a joke eventually, a farce. He’s just going to have to deal with this unavoidable negative about his life. As humans, when an issue repeats itself and never goes away, we tend to accept it, and perhaps even find the humor in it, or the farce. This explains the look on his face. In conclusion, what does the film’s title mean? Who is this Enemy? The only right answer is himself. It’s his desires, fears, and inability to have a normal relationship. This will inevitably lead to the carnage of his sanity, marriage, and maybe his life. Perhaps he does actually work things out, and it can be depressing to think that he will eventually kill himself. But this is only the implied ending of his life. Who really knows. Overall, this is a grand filmmaking achievement, thrilling, sharply directed, extraordinarily acted and beautifully filmed. It’s an underrated future classic, and Denis Villeneuve has further established his filmmaking genius.\n\n- Newer\n- Older",

She even questions him about the phone call he just had with Nerdy Jake and accusing him of lying about the person on the other end, claiming that it was a woman. She asks, “Are you seeing her again?” This implies that Fancy Pants Jake has cheated on her in the past. Naturally, he goes ballistic on her, screaming that it was a man. So although Fancy Pants Jake is living a better life overall, he’s dealing with the fear of commitment to women, similar to that song playing in the film rental store. It clearly makes him feel that his freedom has been removed by his pregnant wife, almost feeling controlled by the scenario. Reverting back to the “cheating in the past” point, this explains why Fancy Pants Jake was in that sex club at the beginning of the movie. He’s terrified of the responsibility of starting a family and staying with one woman in a committed relationship. To understand this theme is vital to comprehending the movie itself, prominently the spiders. Then, Nerdy Jake and Fancy Pants Jake agree to meet at a hotel room, suddenly feeling that they have a need to see each other. Helen appears at Nerdy Jake’s school, and her look upon seeing him is of extreme pain and sadness. Sure it’d be odd to see an identical man to your husband, but what’s with the overreaction? Nerdy Jake asks her, “How many months are you?” She explains that she is six months pregnant. HAH! Coincidence? I think NOT. Remember when the security guard said he was gone from the talent agency for six months? Well that’s the exact same time period when compared to the amount of months Helen was pregnant. This obviously backs up my point about Fancy Pants Jake’s feelings of captivity in his current marriage. He hasn’t even been to his talent agency since his wife got pregnant. He is dictated by a woman and child. The next moment could simply be a coincidence, but it does leave me to wonder. It’s when Helen picks up her phone to call Fancy Pants Jake, and right before Nerdy Jake walks out of the frame, he picks up his phone. This would re-affirm the director’s thoughts on the two being the same person.\n\n        Later, when Helen is sitting on the couch at home, Fancy Pants Jake returns from a run…Supposedly. He complains they are out of his favorite organic blueberries. She can’t say anything, simply staying in her position, afraid and depressed before explaining that the man she saw at the school looked exactly like Fancy Pants Jake. She even says, “What’s happening?” When he explains that he is oblivious to what she is talking about, she responds with, “I think you know.” She is slowly but surely discovering that her husband’s mind has split, desiring for him to come to terms with the fact that this has happened. This is why she appears in such emotional distress. This is when we get one of the more haunting spider visions. It shows Fancy Pants Jake walking down a hallway as a woman with a spider head passes by him casually. This is after his wife questioned him about his motives and tried to get him to explain everything to her. Almost identically, we cut to Nerdy Jake standing in a similar hallway as we see two shots of a scantily dressed woman resembling the spider lady. Next, after all of this gorgeously constructed, brilliant set-up, the two finally meet. The two initially compare themselves, noticing that they have an identical scar on each other’s chests. Nerdy Jake leaves out of pure terror, but he gives the talent agency package to Fancy Pants Jake shortly before. The next two shots are also parallels of sorts, focusing on the two dealing with this situation, and after something inside him cracks, Fancy Pants Jake decides to follow Nerdy Jake. He takes notice of Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend, and follows her as well. You may be questioning how would Fancy Pants Jake know how to find the other one? Isn’t it obvious? I mean they share the same damn conscious so I bet it’s quite simple. While on the train following Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend, Fancy Pants Jake has a quick moment in which he ogles at her head-to-toe. He quickly turns around trying to deal with the temptation of sleeping around. He has obvious issues with being faithful to his wife. Before anything else happens, the scene ends with a shot of Fancy Pants Jake in deep thought in his apartment, sitting on a chair. Did he dream that entire scenario up? Was he roaming the depths of his mind attempting to learn about the other version of himself? Perhaps.\n\n        Nerdy Jake visits his mother, explaining this precarious situation to her. His mother simply says, “The last thing you need is to be meeting strange men in hotels. You have enough trouble sticking with one woman don’t you do this.” This, once again, adds to my assumption (and fact) that Jake overall, as one person, has trouble being faithful to women. His mother offers him some blueberries to which he reluctantly rejects, stating that he doesn’t like them. “Of course you do,” his mother says. Although it may seem quite vague, it seems like Nerdy Jake is attempting to forget the memories of his other self, Fancy Pants Jake, seemingly repressing them. She explains that he has a nice apartment, a respectable job, and that he should quit his fantasy of being an actor. WHAT!!?? Isn’t this Nerdy Jake, the history teacher? Not Fancy Pants Jake, the actor? No, you fools! THEY ARE THE SAME PERSON. That’s not it, though. If you recall that in the beginning of the movie his mother actually states that she doesn’t like the state of his apartment, but now she is suddenly saying it’s nice. Since she also said that he has a respectable job and should quit his acting fantasy, this has lead me to assume that his acting job has gone nowhere. The small roles he was in didn’t amount to anything, and he never got that one breakout performance. So he’s just a history teacher, right? The fact that his mother said this could also be related to the fact that Helen explained that she went to his work. This concludes that Helen was just realizing the true magnitude of her husband’s psychosis, desperately trying to connect with him, to try and help him by going along with his mental illness. Possibly one of my favorite shots of all-time then appears, and it adds to the crazy spider imagery. We get a wide, beautiful shot tinted with the movie’s yellow-green color palette that’s almost nauseating. It shows a giant, otherworldly spider roaming Toronto, which has also left many people perplexed, as it did for me. No, spiders are still not taking over the world. I’ll explain more later.\n\n        Next is the scene that further confirms Jake Gyllenhaal should have won the Oscar in 2013. Seriously, this man was in <Name>Enemy</Name> and Prisoners in the same year and didn’t even get nominated. Up yours, Academy. It showcases Fancy Pants Jake practicing a question that he’s going to ask Nerdy Jake in the mirror with himself. He’s asking in the mirror over and over again if he’s had sex with his wife. Yeah, out of the blue. Fancy Pants Jake then actually confronts Nerdy Jake and asks him, “Did you f…k my wife?” In one of the most iconic moments of the film. He does this again and again, but Nerdy Jake can’t even bring himself to say anything. A heated argument ensues and a deal is made. Fancy Pants Jake will take Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend on a romantic get-away, sleep with her, and call it even, disappearing from his life forever. At least I believe that he’s intentionally starting a war with his subconscious so he can eliminate the negative parts and be with his wife forever. Nerdy Jake decides to go to Fancy Pants Jake’s wife as this battle occurs in his mind. I believe that this is the real-life Jake, the one who has gone back to see his wife. This is while the narcissistic, unfaithful Jake takes another woman out to have sex. The real Jake gets the doorman to let him in to the apartment door. The doorman just so happens to be a man who was in the club at the beginning. He mentions to Nerdy Jake that he wants to go back to this club, and explains that the lock for the place has changed, stating that new keys have been sent out. Since Nerdy Jake doesn’t know what he’s talking about, he just goes along with the conversation. When the doorman lets Nerdy Jake in, he seems to be discovering things in the apartment for the first time as he attempts to resemble Fancy Pants Jake. Nerdy Jake then notices a photograph, and it’s the same one from his apartment, except not torn. It shows himself with his wife. When Helen arrives home he continues to nervously try and become Fancy Pants Jake. During this, we cut to Fancy Pants Jake with Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend entering their hotel room. We cut back to Nerdy Jake getting into bed with Helen, nervous about taking his clothes off. She looks at him with desire and places his hand on her pregnant belly, seemingly reminding him of his responsibility. Remember, she is desperately trying to figure out her husband’s mental dilemma. \n\n        Meanwhile, Fancy Pants Jake and Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend are in the middle of having sex when she notices something. He has a wedding ring mark on his finger. She gets extremely upset and immediately jumps out of bed, flustered by the discovery. Weirdly, Nerdy Jake wakes up at that exact moment, with Fancy Pants Jake’s wife sleeping by his side. Quickly, we cut back to Fancy Pants Jake and Nerdy Jake’s girlfriend, who suddenly wants nothing to do with him. They are driving on their way back to Toronto and a terrible argument begins. This is spliced with scenes of Nerdy Jake walking back and forth before eventually crying. His wife comforts him, and their hands interlock as he says through tears that he’s sorry. During this, Melanie Laurent’s character and Fancy Pants Jake continue arguing, but back in Toronto, his wife tells Nerdy Jake that she wants him to stay as they embrace on the couch, kissing. Fancy Pants Jake and Melanie’s argument gets worse with her insulting him, claiming that he’s not a real man. This truly makes Fancy Pants Jake snap and he swerves the car, crashing it in violent fashion. We get more spider imagery when the camera zooms on the cracked window of the car, representing a spider web. I feel that in this moment Jake has successfully used his subconscious war with himself to effectively eliminate the negative self. The next morning, we hear a radio broadcast explaining the car crash incident. Since Fancy Pants Jake, or the negative side of this character, has been killed, I will refer to Nerdy Jake as simply Jake. Jake turns off the radio while his wife is in the shower. He finally opens the talent agency package that’s been shown throughout the film. In it, there is a key to the club. He stares at it with a look of temptation and lust, still struggling to resist the urge of being unfaithful despite eliminating Fancy Pants Jake. His wife says his mother called as he continues to stare at the key. He asks if she has anything to do tonight because he has to “go out”. This clearly implies that he wants to go back to the club, unfaithful once again. Some people have called this the scariest ending of all-time in cinema. It’s after Helen doesn’t answer and Jake goes into the room where she’s in. A massive spider suddenly crawls up in the corner of the room in fear and anxiety, squeaking in terror at Jake’s presence. Right! Readers still don’t know what all this spider imagery means! Time to finally spill the beans.\n\n        This ending had audiences screaming three words…What the f..k!!?? And I get it, I had a similar reaction. But there is a real meaning behind the conclusion. The spiders in the film represent women. I mean, at least in the ways that Jake views women. In the real world, spiders entrap their prey in their webs, entangling them. Oftentimes when mating, the female spider actually kills the male one right after and occasionally even before they mate. The film is basically saying that Jake’s character has been devoured, lost his freedom in the spiders that are the women in his life, trapped in the web that is his marriage. The references to dictatorship and being unwillingly ruled obviously has to do with Jake feeling this way about the responsibility of having a child and being faithful to his wife. In the beginning of the movie, Fancy Pants Jake watches a woman about to squash a spider at a sex club. Principally, through his unfaithfulness, he almost longs to “squash” his wife. Metaphorically, of course. This is why he goes somewhere where love doesn’t exist, where men can watch their fantasies being acted out for them, free of responsibility. The woman in the hallway with the spider head supports this, and the scantily clad one that Nerdy Jake sees resembles that woman. But what about the giant one roaming Toronto? The scene took place seconds after he met with his mother, so it’s only reasonable to assume that this spider represents his mother. Then, of course, there’s the final spider in the closing scene. Why did his wife turn into a massive spider? And why did such a big creature react in fear? And why was his look after he sees the spider almost one of acceptive disappointment and not shock? It was almost like he has come to terms with what his life is now like. Going back a bit, when Jake finds the new key to the club, he gets a look of temptation on his face, an urge to watch his deepest desires. He immediately decides that he’s going that very night, and when his wife is revealed to be a spider, she backs up quickly in fear of “getting squashed”. In other terms, his general unfaithfulness and lack of responsibility towards their relationship. This is why Jake is watching a woman squash a spider, because that’s what he really wants…To kill true love. After having eliminated his unfaithful side of himself, but at the first sign of temptation, he gives in with no extra thought. He goes back to his adulterous ways, which explains why his wife reacted in terror. Jake is the spider killer, not being able to control his urges and commit to a healthy relationship. He gives in too easily to sleeping with other women, and that prevents him from having a good life with his wife, or to the eventual family that he will have. He views all of this as a dictatorship, which we know is something that he is defiant to. The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman poster, along with the song “The Cheater”, and his torn photo of him and his wife all support his fear of women, unfaithfulness, and attempts to ruin his marriage.\n\n        Then there’s that look of acceptive disappointment on his face. Remember when I pointed out that Nerdy Jake explained that “This is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history.” It may seem like a stretch, but I believe that Jake is realizing that he’s starting the same pattern again despite having eliminated the negative portion of himself. Repeating his mistakes almost instantly after the first sign of temptation. Intriguingly, the film truly ends with him missing a call from his mother, and begins with the voicemail of the call. Take note that earlier in the movie, Nerdy Jake pointed out that Hegel said something about all of history’s greatest events happening twice, and that Karl Marx explained that the first time it was a tragedy and the second time it was a farce. I believe that after him getting over his adultery, he realizes that this repeating process is going to become a joke eventually, a farce. He’s just going to have to deal with this unavoidable negative about his life. As humans, when an issue repeats itself and never goes away, we tend to accept it, and perhaps even find the humor in it, or the farce. This explains the look on his face. In conclusion, what does the film’s title mean? Who is this Enemy? The only right answer is himself. It’s his desires, fears, and inability to have a normal relationship. This will inevitably lead to the carnage of his sanity, marriage, and maybe his life. Perhaps he does actually work things out, and it can be depressing to think that he will eventually kill himself. But this is only the implied ending of his life. Who really knows. Overall, this is a grand filmmaking achievement, thrilling, sharply directed, extraordinarily acted and beautifully filmed. It’s an underrated future classic, and <Director>Denis Villeneuve</Director> has further established his filmmaking genius.\n    </AdditionalInformation>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have inserted the relevant XML tags according to the attributes specified in the ADT.

                    "Review": "I recently had the gift of watching the only English-speaking film from Denis Villeneuve that I hadn’t seen, and that was Enemy. I glossed over it in the past because it was known as his weakest movie, and only decided to watch it days ago. WHAT. THE. HELL. I wrote that for two reasons. One: this is a fantastic movie with great performances, an eerie score and hauntingly beautiful imagery. Two: It has to be the most confusing film I have ever seen, and that is a hard bar to surpass considering what my brain has witnessed. Enemy is almost like if Only God Forgives focused less on violence and more on interesting characters while providing all the necessary visual storytelling. It combines both scarring visuals with a narrative that’s too rarely seen in cinema. Despite not being his greatest movie, it certainly is not his worst, and I’d even go as far as to call it a masterpiece. Then again, basically all of Denis Villeneuve’s films are. This film is too much for just a simple review, and calls for an in-depth analysis."

                "Plot": "Carrying out orders, inexperienced hitman Ray shoots a priest during confession, but accidentally kills a young boy standing behind him. He and his mentor Ken are sent to hide in Bruges by their boss Harry, where they are to sightsee and await further instruction. Ken finds the city beautiful and relaxing, while Ray is bored and hates it. They chance upon a film shoot involving a dwarf actor, which amuses Ray. Ray is attracted to Chloë, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple over smoking indoors and punches them. Chloë takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray effortlessly disarms the small-time criminal and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chloë admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. As Chloë drives Eirik to the hospital, Ray pockets the gun and helps himself to a handful of live rounds as well as Chloë's stash of drugs. He and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites. Harry calls Ken and reveals that the trip was an attempt to give Ray a good experience before he dies. He orders Ken to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken phones Harry to tell him the truth, and Harry immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun and a box of dumdum bullets at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention. Ray's train stops, and the police escort him back to Bruges for attacking the Canadians. Chloë bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Meanwhile, Harry spots Ken at a café. As the two have drinks, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is not convinced. Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from bystanders. At the top, Ken says he accepts whatever punishment Harry intends. A conflicted Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray. Meanwhile, Eirik crosses the market square and sees Ray and Chloë on a date. He rushes up the tower to inform Harry, who is helping Ken down the stairs. Ken tries to disarm Harry, but he is mortally shot in the neck as Harry rushes to the square. Bleeding heavily, Ken drags himself back to the top of the tower, and accepts he must jump to save Ray. The warning works, and Ken warns Ray with his dying breath, but his gun is broken during the fall, forcing Ray back to the hotel to retrieve his own. Harry chases Ray to the hotel; Marie, the pregnant owner, refuses Harry entry, even when he draws his gun. To protect the owner and her unborn child, Harry and Ray agree to continue the chase on the canal. Ray jumps onto a passing barge, but loses Eirik's gun. Harry wounds Ray with a shot from a distance. Ray stumbles into the street where Jimmy's film is shooting. Harry catches up and repeatedly shoots Ray with the dumdum bullets. One of the bullets hits Jimmy (costumed as a schoolboy), blowing his head open. Mistakenly believing that he has killed a child, Harry, despite protest from Ray, kills himself. Ray is carried through the movie set and watches the other characters pass by (Chloë, Marie and Eirik) as he is loaded into an ambulance. In narration, Ray reflects on the nature of hell, speculating that it is an eternity in the city of Bruges, and recalls that he really, really hoped he would not die. His fate is left ambiguous.",

I glossed over it in the past because it was known as his weakest movie, and only decided to watch it days ago. WHAT. THE. HELL. I wrote that for two reasons. One: this is a fantastic movie with great performances, an eerie score and hauntingly beautiful imagery. Two: It has to be the most confusing film I have ever seen, and that is a hard bar to surpass considering what my brain has witnessed. Enemy is almost like if Only God Forgives focused less on violence and more on interesting characters while providing all the necessary visual storytelling. It combines both scarring visuals with a narrative that’s too rarely seen in cinema. Despite not being his greatest movie, it certainly is not his worst, and I’d even go as far as to call it a masterpiece. Then again, basically all of Denis Villeneuve’s films are. This film is too much for just a simple review, and calls for an in-depth analysis."
