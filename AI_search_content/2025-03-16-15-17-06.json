Other than kaiju, they’re my favorite monster species of all time, and one of the best things about them is their versatility. Sure, there are enough Dracula remakes and rip-offs to keep you occupied for what seems like an undead eternity, but there are also plenty of unconventional vampire movies that deviate from the standard Transylvanian template.\n\nSometimes the bloodsuckers themselves are unique, and other times the stories are what set these films apart. But either way, when you sit down to watch one of them, it’ll be an experience unlike just about anything else the subgenre has to offer. You might even say that unconventional vampire movies are the lifeblood of the subgenre.\n\nThey keep it from becoming stale and falling into the same overused tropes over and over again (take note, zombies!), and if you’re on the prowl for one of these films, you’ve come to the right place. I’ve compiled a list of five of my favorite unconventional vampire movies you need to check out, so without further ado, let’s dive right in.\n\n## Black Sunday\n\nLet’s start with the 1960 classic Black Sunday. It was the feature directorial debut of the great Italian filmmaker Mario Bava, and it takes a very unusual approach to vampire lore. It’s so unconventional I don’t even have this movie in the vampire section of my Blu-ray collection. The story centers around a witch named Asa who rises from her grave to fulfill a curse she enacted at her death, so I put this film in my witch section.\n\nBut if that’s the case, why would I include Black Sunday in a list of unconventional vampire movies? It’s actually pretty simple. This woman isn’t just a witch. The film explicitly calls her a vampire in its opening scene, and when she comes back to life, she has to drink human blood to regain her strength. In other words, Asa is a weird sort of vampire/witch hybrid, and the story combines elements of both subgenres.\n\nIt’s a surprising mix, but unsurprisingly, Bava finds a way to make it work. He was known for creating sumptuous visual feasts just about every time he stepped into the director’s chair, and Black Sunday is a shining example of that world-class talent. It’s an absolute masterclass in gothic style and atmosphere, so this is more than just one of the most unconventional vampire movies ever made. It’s one of the best films the subgenre has ever produced.\n\n## Let’s Scare Jessica to Death\n\nNext up, we have Let’s Scare Jessica to Death, a vampire film that’s more psychological than supernatural. In the movie, Jessica is just released from a mental hospital, and when she moves into a new home with her husband, she starts to question her sanity all over again. See, when the couple arrives at the house, they find the place occupied by a mysterious squatter named Emily, and Jessica soon comes to believe that Emily is a vampire who has the entire town in her thrall. But is that really the case, or is this just another one of the fragile woman’s paranoid delusions?\n\nWe never find out, so if unreliable narrators and narrative ambiguity aren’t your thing, Let’s Scare Jessica to Death will probably just frustrate you to no end. But if you enjoy stories that leave you scratching your head long after the credits begin to roll, this is the vampire film for you. It puts you in Jessica’s shoes and forces you to watch these events from her perspective, so you simply never know if what you’re seeing is real or not. Both options are totally plausible, and that uncertainty will make you second-guess yourself almost as much as Jessica does. It’s the kind of psychological mindf*ck we rarely get from this subgenre. Let’s Scare Jessica to Death more than earns its status as one of the most unconventional vampire movies of all time.\n\n## Martin\n\nIf Let’s Scare Jessica to Death wasn’t unique enough for you, try giving George Romero’s Martin a watch. It’s a drama horror about a young man who thinks he’s a vampire, and much like Let’s Scare Jessica to Death, we never definitively learn if he’s a genuine monster or just mentally ill. However, unlike the last film we looked at, this one plays very fast and loose with the vampire mythology we all know and love.\n\nOne of Martin’s constant refrains throughout the movie is “There isn’t any magic,” so he lacks many of the typical attributes we often associate with vampires. For example, he can’t turn into a bat, and things like sunlight and garlic don’t affect him. He doesn’t even have fangs, so to drink people’s blood, he has to drug them and cut their veins open with a razor.\n\nIf you’ve never seen Martin before, you might suspect that all those changes to the traditional vampire lore would make for a bland viewing experience, but in the hands of a master like George Romero, they actually make the film better. They help give it the biting and heartbreaking social commentary we’ve come to expect from the guy who made Dawn of the Dead, so this isn’t just one of the most unconventional vampire movies most people have never seen. It’s one of the best horror films of all time, and it just might be the best movie George Romero ever made.\n\n## Cronos\n\nNext up, we have Cronos, the feature directorial debut of Guillermo del Toro. It’s about a man named Jesús Gris who stumbles upon a mysterious scarab-shaped device made by a reclusive alchemist hundreds of years ago, and the thing slowly turns him into a vampire. But in typical del Toro fashion, this guy is unlike any vampire you’ve ever seen before. Sure, he drinks blood and has an aversion to sunlight, but beyond those barebones basics, he’s about as far from the stereotypical Dracula template as you can get.\n\nFor example, Jesús doesn’t develop fangs, he never hurts anyone unless they try to hurt him or the people he loves first, and he can’t turn other people into vampires (because he himself wasn’t turned that way). What’s more, even though this guy is a monster, he’s not the villain of the story. Instead, the bad guys here are a pair of regular human beings who are way more monstrous than this vampire could ever be, and they’ll stop at nothing to achieve the youthfulness and immortality Jesús has gained completely by accident.\n\nThey make for an incredibly compelling inversion of the typical vampire formula, so not only is Jesús totally different from any other bloodsucker ever put on screen, but Cronos as a whole is unlike anything else this subgenre has ever produced. It’s hands down one of the most unconventional vampire movies of all time, and it was an auspicious debut for one of the best genre filmmakers of the last few decades.\n\n## Let the Right One In\n\nLast but not least, we have Let the Right One In, arguably the best vampire film of this millennium. It’s about a young boy named Oskar who befriends Eli, a girl he thinks is around his age, but he soon finds out that there’s more to her than meets the eye. Eli is a vampire, and she’s actually much older than him. The girl simply doesn’t age, so these two form a most unlikely pair.\n\nBut despite that apparent mismatch, Let the Right One In tells a surprisingly beautiful story of love and acceptance. See, Oskar is bullied a lot at school, so he’s kind of an outsider. And since Eli isn’t even human, she definitely doesn’t fit in with “normal” society either. They’re both outcasts, but they find in each other the camaraderie they so desperately need.\n\nThat being said, I don’t want you to get the wrong idea. Even though Let the Right One In is a drama horror that focuses more on story than scares, it still has some genuinely horrific moments. Most notably, there’s a scene at the very end of the movie that’s legitimately one of the most brutal vampire attacks I’ve ever seen on screen. It admittedly doesn’t show us all the gory details, but somehow, that restraint actually makes the scene even more intense.\n\nIt’s the cherry on top of this masterpiece of the subgenre, so Let the Right One In is pretty much the perfect blend of beauty and brutality. Seriously, this is one of the best vampire movies ever made, unconventional or not, so if you’re a horror fan and you haven’t seen it, you need to remedy that.

These are 10 of its best.\n\nA Man Called Ove (2015)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA comic drama about a curmudgeonly widower, Hannes Holm’s A Man Called Ove – released in cinemas and on BFI Player on 30 June – is the 15th Swedish title to have been nominated for the Academy Award for best foreign film. To date, only Ingmar Bergman has taken the prize (on three occasions), but there is more to Swedish cinema than the Master of Fårö…\n\nIn the 1910s, pioneers Charles Magnusson and Georg af Klercker established a tradition of combining social trenchancy with imaginative technique. This was furthered by Victor Sjöström and Mauritz Stiller, who used naturalistic settings, moving cameras and rhythmic editing to establish the psychological tension for which Swedish films remained renowned after the pair tried their luck in Hollywood.\n\n### Get the latest from the BFI\n\nSign up for BFI news, features, videos and podcasts.\n\nSvensk Filmindustri struggled to make an international impact in the sound era, despite the efforts of Hasse Ekman, Gustav Molander, Anders Hendrikson and Alf Sjöberg. The latter gave Bergman his break, as the writer of Torment (1944). But, as he refined his early neorealist style to explore doomed love and crises of faith, contemporaries like Arne Mattsson and Hampe Faustman eschewed commercial comedy to introduce a new social consciousness. This in turn was seized upon during the 1960s by Bo Widerberg, Jan Troell and Vilgot Sjöman, who tackled sexual themes with a gravitas that was missing from the work of sexploitation specialists like Torgny Wickman.\n\nBut it wasn’t all smut, isolation and despair. Lasse Åberg followed the duo of Hans Alfredson and Tage Danielsson in producing popular comedies that found more favour with domestic audiences than the offbeat sagas of Roy Andersson, the polished melodramas of Lasse Hallström (who also directed the best ABBA videos) and the hip provocations of Lukas Moodysson.\n\nThese ranked among the most successful exports until the millennial vogue for genre cinema and Nordic noir reached its box-office peak with Niels Arden Oplev’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009). But, in producing around 20 features each year, the Swedish film industry continues to diversify, with a growing number of female and second generation talents coming to the fore.\n\n## Sir Arne’s Treasure (1919)\n\nDirector: Mauritz Stiller\n\nSir Arne's Treasure (1919)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe golden age of Swedish silent cinema owed much to Nobel-winning novelist Selma Lagerlöf. Victor Sjöström adapted The Sons of Ingmar (1919), Karin Ingmarsdotter (1920) and The Phantom Carriage (1921) from her stories, while Mauritz Stiller followed this supernaturally inflected 16th-century ‘winter ballad’ with Gunnar Hedes Saga (1923) and Gösta Berlings Saga (1924), which made a star of Greta Garbo.\n\nMary Johnson and Richard Lund headline this tense, fatalist tale of an adopted child falling for the Scottish mercenary who has murdered her family and stolen its cursed treasure. But the focus falls firmly on the forbidding landscape, as Stiller and cinematographer Julius Jaenzon convey humanity’s insignificance through the poetic tinted images of the troops trudging through the snow, the villagers speeding by sleigh to the vicarage fire and the mourners proceeding to the ship trapped in the frozen fjord. John W. Brunius also specialised in period pieces, but, despite their grandeur, they lacked Stiller’s authenticity and finesse.\n\n## Häxan (1922)\n\nDirector: Benjamin Christensen\n\nHäxan (1922)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLike Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), Dane Benjamin Christensen’s masterpiece adopted a novel structural and visual approach to its contentious material. Yet, while Wiene helped shape German Expressionism and the nascent horror genre, Christensen slipped into obscurity, along with his uncategorisable combination of documentary, burlesque, exploitation and morality play.\n\nFascinated by historical witch-hunts, Christensen had originally devised a trilogy before producer Charles Magnusson entrusted him with the biggest budget for any Scandinavian silent. Production designer Richard Louw and cinematographer Johan Ankerstjerne worked minor miracles in recreating medieval Germany and realising such technically audacious scenes as the ‘flight to Bloksbjerg’. But, while the Surrealists delighted in the film’s discussion of cannibalism, blasphemy, torture, deformity and mutilation, as well as its images of fornication, urination and masturbation, Variety declared it “absolutely unfit for public exhibition”. Nevertheless, it acquired a cult cachet after William S. Burroughs collaborated on a 1968 version entitled Witchcraft through the Ages.\n\n## Miss Julie (1951)\n\nDirector: Alf Sjöberg\n\nMiss Julie (1951)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlf Sjöberg’s take on August Strindberg’s ‘naturalistic tragedy’ about a count’s daughter’s illicit midsummer tryst with her father’s valet won the Grand Prix at Cannes. Not only did Sjöberg open out the action from its kitchen setting, but he also introduced a smattering of background characters to help blur the lines between past and present, as Anita Björk struggles to come to terms with the psychological scars left by her unhappy childhood and to make sense of the conflicted notions of class, morality and sexual etiquette that Ulf Palme arouses within her.\n\nMoreover, by dispensing with much of the original dialogue in order to disrupt the narrative linearity and allow deceased characters to wander into the densely symbolic Expressionist mise-en-scène, Sjöberg breached the reverential rules that pertained to European literary transfers (what François Truffaut called the ‘Tradition of Quality’). Critic Peter Cowie was prompted to declare that Sjöberg had fashioned “a new cinematic language”.\n\n## Wild Strawberries (1957)\n\nDirector: Ingmar Bergman\n\nWild Strawberries (1957)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHaving been one of the architects of the classical screen narrative with Ingeborg Holm (1913), Victor Sjöström conspired with Ingmar Bergman to deconstruct it in this deceptively witty and optimistic road movie that shares many themes with Bergman’s previous picture, The Seventh Seal (1957).\n\nSeeking to justify himself to his parents, Bergman borrowed ideas from Shakespeare’s King Lear and Strindberg’s A Dream Play and images from Sjöström’s The Phantom Carriage and Sjöberg’s Miss Julie in steering a septuagenarian medic (en route to receive an honorary degree) through nightmares and reveries on a journey of symbolic doubling, regret, dread and self-realisation. It’s all the more affecting for Sjöström’s watchful performance, especially as daughter-in-law Ingrid Thulin sees past the aloof egotism and bonds with the vulnerable soul who has always been denied the love he craved.\n\n## Raven’s End (1963)\n\nDirector: Bo Widerberg\n\nRaven’s End (1963)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdvocating a more politically conscious Swedish cinema, Bo Widerberg earned the first of his three Oscar nominations for this gritty kitchen sink saga (the others would come for Ådalen 31, 1969, and All Things Fair, 1995, rather than his best-known work, Elvira Madigan, 1967). Set in 1936, it highlights the conditions that incubated fascism, positing a radical departure from traditional morality to shatter the restrictions imposed upon the lower classes.\n\nAs a novelist himself, Widerberg taps into the chauvinist compassion of ‘angry young man’ fiction to convey the frustrations of aspiring author Thommy Berggren, who feels trapped in a tenement in the rundown Raven’s End district of the northern city of Malmö. But the influence of John Cassavetes and British social realism is readily evident in Jan Lindeström’s camerawork and Berggren’s seething encounters with his feuding parents, the sniffy Stockholm publisher, his ambitious footballing buddy and the adoring girl next door. A masterpiece awaiting wider discovery.\n\n## I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967)\n\nDirector: Vilgot Sjöman\n\nI Am Curious (Yellow) (1967)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHaving tackled bestiality in 491 (1964) and incest in My Sister My Love (1966), Vilgot Sjöman revelled in controversy. But this faux vérité appeal for change broke American box office records for foreign-language films after the supreme court sanctioned its release following its seizure by US customs. Moreover, this epochal blend of the cerebral and the sensual sparked a war of words at the New York Times, with Vincent Canby declaring it a “wise, serious, sometimes deadpannedly funny movie about the politics of life – and of moviemaking”, while Rex Reed fumed: “this genuinely vile and disgusting Swedish meatball is pseudo-pornography at its ugliest and least titillating”.\n\nSwitching between drama student Lena Nyman’s fraught relationship with menswear salesman Börje Ahlstedt, interviews with Martin Luther King and Olof Palme, and vox pops conducted on the streets of Stockholm, Sjöman touches on everything from sex and violence to class, gender and religion. Yet I Am Curious (Blue) (1968) had markedly less impact.\n\n## The Emigrants (1971)\n\nDirector: Jan Troell\n\nThe Emigrants (1971)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite being renowned for his 11-film collaboration with Ingmar Bergman, Max von Sydow also made eight features with Jan Troell, none better than this adaptation of Vilhelm Moberg’s bestselling quartet (1949-59), which formed part of a 394-minute duology with The New Land (1972). Costing 7m Swedish kronor, this was the most expensive Swedish film to date and became only the third foreign-language title to receive a best picture nomination at the Oscars.\n\nHeading the ensemble with the impeccable Liv Ullmann, von Sydow excels as an impoverished farmer who leaves his rocky plot in Småland in 1850 and devotes four decades to taming the vast expanses around Chisago Lake in Minnesota Territory. Acting as his own cinematographer and editor, Troell achieves a documentary intimacy that belies the story’s epic sweep, for, while key events in American history impinge upon the community’s bid to fulfil its manifest destiny, this is also a chronicle of a marriage through better and worse.\n\n## Show Me Love (1998)\n\nDirector: Lukas Moodysson\n\nShow Me Love (1998)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorthern Europe knocks the spots off Hollywood when it comes to kidpix, and 29-year-old Lukas Moodysson announced himself as an instant master with a debut that won Berlin’s prestigious Teddy Award and four Guldbaggen. The story sticks closely to the ‘lesbian coming out’ format, but Rebecka Liljeberg and Alexandra Dahlström are so natural as the misfitting newcomer and the class princess that their plight comes to seem like a female slant on Raven’s End, with the lakeland town of Åmål becoming the seething bed of crushing conformity that’s sapping the life out of the free-spirited lovers.\n\nHaving been a published poet since his teens, Moodysson deftly captures the teenspeak argot. But it’s his matter-of-fact approach to sexual identity, the tribal nature of high school, the ease with which labels stick, the immaturity of adolescent boys and the well-meaning cluelessness of grown-ups that make this so refreshingly authentic, although Ulf Brantås’s jittery reverse stock imagery certainly helps.\n\n## Songs from the Second Floor (2000)\n\nDirector: Roy Andersson\n\nSongs from the Second Floor (2000)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCritic J. Hoberman considers Roy Andersson to be the “slapstick Ingmar Bergman”. But there’s more of Chaplin, Fellini, Buñuel and Tati about this riotously deadpan return to feature-making after a 25-year hiatus. In fact, Andersson cited philosopher Martin Buber and Peruvian poet César Vallejo among the inspirations for this descent into millennial mayhem, while Goya, Daumier and Dix helped influence the 46 static wide-angled tableaux in their painterly looks.\n\nNo scenes were scripted or storyboarded in advance, and the perfectionist auteur had to dig into his own pocket to complete the four-year project. But each shot makes intellectual and emotional demands on the audience, while also daring them to laugh at the collateral victims of the breakdown of complacent capitalism. This seethingly cynical yet sincerely compassionate blend of ‘complex images’ and ‘trivialism’ is utterly unique in giving the farcical events involving an arsonist furniture salesman, a brutalised immigrant, an unemployed clerk and a misfiring magician such disarming profundity.\n\n## Let the Right One In (2008)\n\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\n\nLet the Right One In (2008)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSweden’s first vampire movie was Anders Banke’s comedy, Frostbite (2006). But snow proves just as crucial to Tomas Alfredson’s adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist’s bestseller. Owing little to the romanticism of Stephenie Meyer, this is horror with a cold, clammy hand, as bullied tweenager Kåre Hedebrant hopes to have found a kindred spirit in mysterious new neighbour Lina Leandersson.\n\nEschewing many of the traditional generic tropes, Alfredson focuses on the poignant platonic bond that forms between the self-loathingly melancholic Leandersson and the potentially psychotic Hedebrant. But, as Hoyte van Hoytema’s camera skulks around the 1980s Stockholm locales, there are also shocking incidents like the climactic underwater slaughter and moments of grim humour, as guardian Per Ragnar’s murderous shortcomings force Leandersson to seek her own prey. Beside the bloodletting, however, this is a chilling depiction of a society in which innocence is persistently imperilled, appearances are inevitably deceptive and good and evil are in a constant state of flux.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## All-you-can-watch access to 100s of films\n\nA free trial, then just £6.99/month or £65/year.\n\n## Other things to explore\n\n10 great\n\n### 10 great Baltic films\n\nBy Carmen  Gray\n\n5 things to watch\n\n### 5 things to watch this weekend – 7 to 9 March\n\nBy Sam Wigley\n\n10 great\n\n### 10 great films based on albums\n\nBy Barry Levitt\n\n- Commercial and licensing\n- BFI distribution\n- Archive content sales and licensing\n- Venue hire\n- BFI book releases and trade sales\n- Selling to the BFI\n- Commercial partnerships and consultancy\n\n- Join and support\n- Become a Member\n- Become a Patron\n- Using your BFI Membership\n- Corporate support\n- Trusts and foundations\n- Make a donation\n\n- About the BFI\n- Strategy and policy\n- Press releases and media enquiries\n- Jobs and opportunities\n- Contact us\n\n## Watch film\n\n- BFI PlayerWatch at home\n- BFI SouthbankLondon SE1 8XTBox office 11am to 8:45pm\n- BFI IMAXLondon SE1 8XROpens 30 minutes before first screening\n\n## British Film Institute\n\nWe are a cultural charity, a National Lottery funding distributor, and the UK’s lead organisation for film and the moving image.\n\n## Supported by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- BFI privacy policy\n- Cookie policy\n- Modern Slavery Act statement\n- Site map\n- Social media guidelines\n- Terms of use\n- Web accessibility statement\n\n©2025 British Film Institute.

Deciding to introduce a supernatural element to your thriller or mystery novel. You see, a thriller and/or mystery story depends on the writer achieving rock-solid suspension of disbelief, but the second you begin hinting at ghostly goings on, or perhaps the existence of fairies, you essentially tear down the world you’ve constructed for your trusting readers and ask them to step into a new, less certain one. But sometimes, it works. And sometimes a writer manages to do something that’s so wildly imaginative and wholly believable that it seeps into your subconscious and hooks into a primal stratum of fear.\n\nMy novel The Lighthouse Witches is a Mystery with a Supernatural Element. It took nerves of steel and over a year of edits to combine the supernatural story with the ‘real world’ story in a way that felt real and authentic. The last thing I wanted was for the supernatural to jolt a reader out of the story, and I also worried that the supernatural and ‘real world’ stories might not speak to each other, that they might carve up the book into two different stories entirely. I felt that the best way to avoid this was to enable the reader to choose what they might believe—that the supernatural was real, or that it was symbolic of an existential theme, like death, or the power of memory. This way, I felt, lay suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe books below combine the supernatural with the real in believable ways:\n\nGraham Joyce’s The Silent Land\n\nThis slim novel is a compelling and moving read, with its emotional registers achieved in how Joyce handles the supernatural element. Jack and Zoe are on a skiing holiday when disaster strikes—they’re caught up in an avalanche. When they return to their hotel, they find it is deserted, as is the nearby village. As they try to work out what has happened, more and more weirdness ensues: candles don’t burn out, food stays fresh. Time itself has somehow stalled. The snowy landscape and empty hotel provide a chilling backdrop for the unfolding mystery, and what follows is a meditation on mortality, written with tenderness. Come for the thrills, stay for the poetry—and bring tissues.\n\nAmanda Jayatissa’s My Sweet Girl\n\nThis smart and twisty debut features a dual timeline, a Sri Lankan protagonist, and a ghostly element that taps into the dual terrors of stalking and obsession. It’s a richly crafted novel, with multiple stories about identity and occupying space as a woman of color. The voice is worth the purchase price alone.\n\nTana French’s The Secret Place\n\nOne of my favorite writers, French deploys the supernatural lightly in her fifth installment of Dublin Murder Squad In this clever psychological suspense, two detectives are called to solve a murder in the grounds of an exclusive boarding school, and their prime suspects are a group of smart-mouthed teenage girls. Without giving too much away, the supernatural here is less a narrative thread than it is an intriguing framework through which to unpick the dynamics of friendship, or the ties between a group of bored, dramatic, and privileged teenage girls.\n\nZakiya Dalila Harris’ The Other Black Girl\n\nIf you’re after a sly, smart, twisty-as-hell character-driven book that examines internalised bias through the lens of the supernatural, this is it. The term ‘genre-defying’ comes up a lot in reviews for the book, and that’s because the book sidesteps expectations and undercuts its own tropes at every turn. Nella is the only black employee at a publishing house, and is thrilled when Hazel, also black, is hired. Rather than becoming an ally, however, Hazel becomes a nemesis, and within this satirical narrative bubbles up another dimension that twists the reader’s expectation whilst simultaneously revealing another tale at its rotten, fanged core.\n\nL. Huchu’s The Library of the Dead\n\nThis book fuses mystery, thriller, urban fantasy and dystopia to tell the story of Ropa, a teenage ‘ghost talker’ who converses with the dead of Edinburgh, Scotland. When the ghosts tell Ropa that local kids are being bewitched, she is duty-bound to investigate. Zimbabwean magic is used here against the (dystopic) backdrop of Edinburgh (which has its own stridently ghostly cultural histories) to powerful effect.\n\nSarah Waters’ The Little Stranger\n\nFew books have seized me the way The Little Stranger did, and I can still recall reading it through my fingers twelve years ago. Waters uses gothic tropes—the crumbling mansion, the troubled protagonist who suspects his new habitat is haunted, fears of madness—to explore questions about class and social mobility. It is precisely the blurring of psychological thriller and ghostly gothic that makes this such a compelling read—Waters is too skilled a writer to offer up easy answers, resolutely leaving it to the reader to decide what kind of tale this is.\n\nStuart Turton’s The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\n\nThis high concept time-slip story grabbed me from the tagline: ‘Gosford Park meets Groundhog Day by way of Agatha Christie.’ Our protagonist slips in and out of bodies, and the mystery of the murdered woman—Anna—must be solved by piecing together days which restart over and over. This is essentially a locked-room thriller with a side order of WTF.\n\nSarah Pinborough’s Behind Her Eyes\n\nDid somebody say WTF? Because Pinborough is Queen of WTF. Behind Her Eyes *seems* like a straightforward psychological thriller, with enough wild-eyed characters and unhealthy relationships to make for a rollercoaster read. But then the supernatural element tiptoes in and chucks the whole plot through a Black Hole. Funny thing is, I didn’t think I would buy into the kind of supernatural Pinborough offers here—but she achieves it, and the result is WTF on steroids.\n\n***\n\n- Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n- More\n\n- Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### C.J.

I get that the movie's themes and how it delivers them is quite...shocking, but it still felt quite accessible to me. The surrealism, the action, the cinematography was all top notch, and was visually compelling enough that I thought it would also attract more 'mainstream' audiences. I get that it's a movie that demands a fair amount of engagement to land its themes, but still, it was so engaging that that level of attention felt effortless to me.",

Even the movie itself goes through a sort of genre-bending transformation, with its head deep in psychological horror, and its second half deeper in contemplation and drama. Overall, this movie felt exceptionally unique, fresh, and special - both for its bold ambitions and its masterful execution.",

                "Plot": "Jen and Richard take a chartered helicopter to his secluded luxury vacation home in the desert. The pilot gives Richard a small bag of peyote. Jen is a young, beautiful American who wants to move to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams and believes Richard can help her. She seduces him, and afterwards, he calls his wife to check in. The next morning, Richard's friends Stan and Dimitri arrive early to take part in a hunting trip. Richard is forced to introduce Jen to them as he planned for her to leave before they arrived. That night, the four of them party. Jen asks to take the peyote but Richard declines, citing an anecdote he heard about a man who took peyote and sawed off his own leg without feeling it. Inebriated, Jen dances a sexy routine. When an exhausted Richard declines to join her, she dances seductively with Stan instead. Jen awakes to Richard being away for the morning. Stan becomes aggressive when she rebuffs his advances, and eventually rapes her. Dimitri sees the rape but ignores it. Richard returns and berates Stan, but when Jen asks to go home, he insists that she move to Canada on his dime. When Jen threatens to reveal their relationship to Richard's wife, Richard slaps her, and she runs off into the desert, pursued by the three men. Richard then shoves her off a cliff and she is impaled by a tree branch. Believing Jen to be dead, Richard assures his friends that they can finish their trip before anyone finds the body. Jen regains consciousness, and while bleeding, is able to painfully free herself, but with a piece of the tree branch still stuck through her torso. When the men return, she hides. With night approaching, they split up to cover more ground. Jen catches Dimitri alone, but he grabs her face and holds her underwater. She grabs his hunting knife and stabs him in the eye. With Dimitri dead, Jen takes his shotgun and hides in a cave. She remembers she has Richard's peyote and takes it, before entering a heightened state of mind when she removes the branch and heats a beer can in the fire to cauterize the wound. The artwork on the can leaves a perfect brand/scar of a phoenix on her belly. After a series of nightmares of the men hunting her, Jen leaves the cave to deal with them. Richard and Stan find Dimitri's body in the water. Stan takes the SUV to continue the hunt, but while filling the gas tank, Jen ambushes him. A bloody gunfight follows, and Stan is shot and killed by Jen while trying to run her over. After not being able to contact Stan on the radio, Richard speeds back home and calls a helicopter to pick him up. While showering, he hears a noise. Jen surprises him and manages to shoot him in the stomach. The two chase each other around the house with shotguns as Richard's blood covers every floor and wall. Despite his blood loss, Richard is able to catch Jen and begins strangling her, but Jen forces her hand into his exposed stomach, allowing her to retake the gun and ultimately shoot Richard dead. A bloodied but triumphant Jen walks out of the house as she hears the helicopter approach.",

                    "Development": "Coralie Fargeat was inspired to make a revenge film in the vein of Mad Max or Rambo, 'with strong characters on a phantasmagoric journey'. Though Fargeat was aware of the rape and revenge film genre, she did not set out to make a film of that type and had never seen I Spit on Your Grave, one of the most well-known films of the genre. Said Fargeat: 'I wanted to take this story out of the genre of horror. I didn't want Jen to be screaming and suffering for the whole movie, trying to survive. I wanted her to go somewhere else and transform into a cool and badass character.'",
                    "Filming": "Revenge was filmed at a Moroccan location, chosen for the nondescript, isolated appearance of its desert. Said Fargeat: 'We had to find the villa, the desert, and the water in the same country. I loved the idea of not being able to recognize exactly where the desert is.' Principal photography on the film began on 6 February and wrapped on 21 March 2017."

                "Reception": "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 132 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: 'Revenge slices and dices genre tropes, working within an exploitation framework while adding a timely – yet never less than viscerally thrilling – feminist spin.' Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating 'universal acclaim'."

                "Plot": "Ove Lindahl, a 59-year-old widower, lives in a townhouse neighborhood where he once chaired the association until his friend Rune replaced him. Rune, now paralyzed from a stroke, is cared for by his wife, Anita. Since his wife Sonja, a schoolteacher, died from cancer six months ago, Ove has been depressed. Forced into retirement from the railroad company where he worked for 43 years, Ove's routine involves enforcing neighborhood rules and visiting Sonja's grave to talk to her. After sorting out his affairs, Ove tries to hang himself, triggering a flashback to his childhood. His mother's death left him with his silent father, a mechanic at the train company. His father's excitement about Ove's academic success leads to a fatal accident when he's hit by a train while spreading the news. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Iranian immigrant Parvaneh, her Swedish husband Patrick, and their children moving in across the street. Her persistence breaks through Ove's tough exterior, causing him to abandon the noose for carbon monoxide poisoning. As Ove drifts into unconsciousness, memories flood back of 'the Whiteshirts' trying to demolish his childhood home, which he defiantly repairs. A fire started by a neighbor leads to Ove also losing his home, forcing him to sleep on a train where he meets Sonja. Smitten, he starts dating her, and she inspires him to pursue an engineering degree. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted again by Parvaneh needing a ride to the hospital for her husband's accident. After reluctantly helping, Ove ends up supervising Parvaneh and Patrick's daughters in the lobby, causing a scene and being asked to leave. Later, at the train station, he plans to end his life but instead saves a man who faints onto the tracks. His heroic act catches the attention of Lena, a local reporter, whom he evades with Parvaneh's help. Parvaneh persuades Ove to teach her how to drive, leading to conversations about his past friendship with Rune and their falling out over car preferences. At Parvaneh's insistence, Ove reluctantly takes in a stray cat, and starts to bond with it. He also repairs a confiscated bike for a local teen named Adrian, who works at a kebab shop with Mirsad. Ove notices Mirsad's eye makeup but doesn't judge him. Despite improving relations with his neighbors, Ove clashes with two Whiteshirts. He then tries to end his life with a shotgun but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad seeking refuge after Mirsad's family disowns him for coming out as gay. Reluctantly, Ove offers him shelter. Ove learns that the Whiteshirts plan to move Rune to a nursing home, information Anita kept from him and Sonja. Ove realizes his grudge against Rune was foolish and declares war on the Whiteshirts. However, his confrontations yield little results. Frustrated, Ove shares with Parvaneh about a tragic vacation in Spain with a pregnant Sonja that ended in a bus crash. Despite Ove's efforts, Sonja lost the baby and was left paraplegic, leading Ove to build a wheelchair ramp at her school when authorities failed to do so. In the present day, journalist Lena confronts the Whiteshirts with evidence of their financial misconduct, leading to their retreat in the face of public scrutiny. Backed by supportive neighbors, Anita prevents Rune's forced relocation, allowing Ove to reconcile with him. Later, Ove collapses and is hospitalized with an enlarged heart. Parvaneh gives birth to a son while teasing Ove about his failed attempts at dying. Ove gifts his unborn child's crib to Parvaneh and forms a close bond with her daughters, who affectionately call him grandpa. Months pass, and during a winter storm, Ove is found peacefully dead in his bed, with his cat by his side. His modest funeral is attended by numerous neighbors, symbolizing the impact he had on their lives. Finally at peace, Ove awakens on a train to find Sonja sitting across from him once more.",

Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it. Agnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party. Elin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes. After becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car. Elin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school. The film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying 'It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.'",

There are three things that impressed me the most about this movie: 1. The cute face and hairstyle of little girl Yingzi, and her eyes are full of innocence. 2. The theme music that always appears at the right time, revealing a touch of parting emotion. 3. The slow-paced way of life in old Beijing. For example, camels and donkeys are used as means of transportation, to dig well water, etc. Everything is the real memory of little girl Yingzi, through her innocent eyes observation, it is really full of emotion, as if it is an unreal past. But I know that those people and things did exist. The good thing is that the little girl doesn't distinguish between good and bad, so she can get close to many people. Now we are all good at value judgment and moral judgment, and it is difficult to be a quiet observer like her. 'Let the past thing pass'. This is one of lines. With the lyrics of the theme music, life seems to be constantly saying goodbye to people and things in the past. Both unpleasant and beautiful things will gradually leave us. What a sadness feeling at last.",

The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a strange child in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, in the early 1980s.\n\nA film adaptation of Lindqvist's novel began development in 2004 when John Nordling acquired the rights to produce the project. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions, decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters and explore the darker side of humanity. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were chosen for the leading roles. Leandersson's role in the film was dubbed by Elif Caylan. Principal photography took place in 2007 in Luleå, with additional filming in Blackeberg. The film was produced by EFTI, Sveriges Television and Filmpool Nord, with support from the Swedish Film Institute, Nordisk Film &amp; TV Fond, WAG and Canal+.\n\nLet the Right One In premiered at the Gothenburg Film Festival on 26 January 2008, where it received the Nordic Film Prize. It was released in Sweden on 24 October 2008 by Sandrew Metronome. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances of the two leads, the cinematography, screenplay, and direction. It won several awards, including the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival, as well as four Guldbagge Awards, including Best Director for Alfredson, Best Cinematography for Van Hoytema, and Best Screenplay for Lindqvist. It also won the Saturn Award for Best International Film and the Empire Award for Best Horror Film. At the 63rd British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for Best Film Not in the English Language. An American remake, titled Let Me In, was released in 2010.\n\n## Plot\n\nOskar resides with his mother in the Swedish suburb of Blackeberg in 1982. His classmates bully him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge. One evening, he meets Eli, who appears to be a girl his age. Eli has moved into the adjoining apartment with a man, Håkan. Eli informs Oskar that they cannot be friends, but the two begin exchanging coded messages through their shared wall. Eli learns that Oskar is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. Oskar enrolls in classes after school.\n\nHåkan kills a person on a footpath to harvest blood for Eli, but is interrupted by a passerby. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a man, Jocke. A recluse witnesses the attack from his flat but doesn't report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in a hole in the lake. Håkan makes another effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a boy in a room after school. When he is unsuccessful, Håkan pours acid onto his own face to avoid identification. Eli visits Håkan in the hospital, where he offers his own neck for feeding. Eli drains him of his blood, and Håkan falls out the window. Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which they agree to \"go steady\", though Eli states, \"I'm not a girl\".\n\nSome of Oskar's classmates discover Jocke's body. The bullies again harass Oskar, who this time hits their leader in the head with a pole. Oskar suggests that he and Eli form a bond and cuts his hand. Eli laps up his blood then runs away. Jocke's friend Lacke has a fight with his girlfriend Virginia, and afterward Eli attacks her. She survives but discovers that she has become sensitive to sunlight. Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Oskar is upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. Eli insists that they are alike, in that Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages him to \"be me, for a little while.\"\n\nVirginia asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room, and bursts into flames. Lacke sets out to kill Eli, whom he finds asleep in the apartment's bathtub. Oskar intervenes, and Eli wakes up and feeds on his blood. Afterward, Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him. Fearing that they've attracted too much attention from the neighbors, Eli decides that it isn't safe to stay and leaves that night.\n\nOskar is lured out to resume the program at the pool. One of the bullies holds Oskar under the water. Eli arrives and rescues him by killing and dismembering the bullies, except for one, who is left sobbing on a bench.\n\nThe last scene is of Oskar travelling on a train, with Eli in a box beside him. Eli taps the code for \"kiss\"[a] to Oskar, who responds the same.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar\n- Lina Leandersson as Eli\n    - Elif Ceylan as Eli (Voice)\n    - Susanne Ruben as Aged Eli\n- Per Ragnar as Håkan\n- Henrik Dahl as Erik\n- Karin Bergquist as Yvonne\n- Peter Carlberg as Lacke\n- Ika Nord as Virginia\n- Mikael Rahm as Jocke\n- Karl Robert Lindgren as Gösta\n- Anders T.

But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist and it turned out we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation\".[5] A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel.[6] While he normally does not like to receive books, because \"it's a private thing to choose what to read\", he decided after a few weeks to read it.[7] The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. \"It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me\", he told the Los Angeles Times.[8] Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work,[7] and he and Alfredson discovered that they \"understood each other very well\".[6]\n\nIn addition to EFTI, co-producers included Sveriges Television and the regional production-centre Filmpool Nord. The production involved a total budget of around 29 million SEK, including support from the Swedish Film Institute, Nordisk Film &amp; TV Fond, WAG, and Canal+.[9][10]\n\n### Screenplay\n\nLindqvist had insisted on writing the screenplay himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres,[11] initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the result very satisfying.[7] Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads.[12][13][14] In particular, many aspects of the character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship.[14] Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).\n\nA key passage in the novel details what happens when a vampire enters a room uninvited, an action that traditional vampire lore usually prohibits.[15] Alfredson originally wanted to omit this from the film, but Ajvide Lindqvist was adamant that it had to be included.[14] Alfredson was initially nervous about the scene. He realised in post-production that the sound effects and music made it \"American, in a bad way\", and had to be removed for the scene to work.[16] The result, which shows Eli slowly beginning to bleed from her eyes, ears, and pores, received positive notices from many critics.[17][18][19] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as a \"haemophilia of rejection\".[15]\n\nThe novel presents Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated centuries before by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles the issue of Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers a glimpse of a suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration.[14] When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar \"I'm not a girl\". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut.[20] In the novel, his vampiric characteristics are also more explicit: Eli can thus transform his hands and feet into real clawed claws, and can also deploy a membrane between his arms and his body to fly. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he \"started to cry because it was so damn beautiful\".[21] He subsequently described the film as a \"masterpiece\".[21] \"It doesn't really matter that [Alfredson] didn't want to do it the way I wanted it in every respect. He could obviously never do that. The film is his creative process\", he said.[14]\n\n### Casting and filming\n\nCasting of the lead actors took almost a year,[22][23] with open castings held all over Sweden. Kåre Hedebrant, selected to audition for the role as Oskar after an initial screening at his school, eventually landed the role.[24] Lina Leandersson responded to an online advertisement seeking a 12-year-old boy or girl \"good at running\".[25] After three more auditions, she was selected to play Eli.[24]\n\nAlfredson has described the casting process as the most difficult part of making the film.[22] He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads,[8] and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were supposed to look.[26] He wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be \"mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like two sides of the same coin.\"[14] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that \"[c]asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the right people to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together.\"[13] In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being \"extremely intelligent\",[23] \"incredibly wise\",[26] and \"unprecedentedly fantastic.\"[23]\n\nThe absence of ceilings made various overhead lighting techniques possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough the film takes place in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, principal photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from around the same time as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture.[12] However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, was shot in the town square of Blackeberg.[16] Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, was shot in the nearby suburb of Råcksta.[12] The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture.[16] Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio.[27] The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film.[20] Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format[20] better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.[16]\n\nMost of the filming used a single, fixed, Arri 535B camera, with almost no handheld usage, and few cuts. Tracking shots relied on a track-mounted dolly, rather than Steadicam, to create calm, predictable camera movement.[28] The crew paid special attention to lighting. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and director Alfredson invented a technique they called \"spray light\". In an interview, van Hoytema describes it as follows: \"If you could capture dull electrical light in a can and spray it like hairspray across Eli’s apartment, it would have the same result as what we created\". For the emotional scenes between Oskar and Eli, van Hoytema consistently diffused the lighting.[28]\n\n### Post-production\n\nThe film contains around fifty shots with computer-generated imagery. Alfredson wanted to make them very subtle and almost unnoticeable.[20] The sequence where multiple cats attack Virginia, one of the most complicated scenes to film, required several weeks of drafting and planning. The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.[16]\n\nThe film features analogue sound-effects exclusively throughout.[23] The lead sound-designer Per Sundström explained: \"The key to good sound effects is working with natural and real sounds.(...) These analogue sounds can be digitally reworked as much as necessary, but the origin has to be natural\".[29] Sundström designed the soundscape to come as close to the actors as possible, with audible heartbeats, breathing, and swallowing. Late in production it was also decided to overdub actress Lina Leandersson's voice with a less feminine one, to underline the backstory.[30] \"She's 200 years old, not twelve. We needed that incongruity. Besides, it makes her menacing\", Sundström said.[29] Both men and women up to the age of forty auditioned for the role. After a vote, the film team ended up selecting Elif Ceylan, who provides all of Eli's spoken dialogue.[31] Footage of Ceylan eating melon or sausage was combined with various animal noises to emulate the sound of Eli biting into her victims and drinking their blood.[23][29] The sound crew won a Guldbagge Award for Best Achievement from the Swedish Film Institute, for the \"nightmarishly great sound\" in the film.[32]\n\n### Soundtrack\n\nSwedish composer Johan Söderqvist wrote the score which was performed by The Slovak National Symphony Orchestra.[33] MovieScore Media issued the 21-track film soundtrack in a limited edition of 500 copies on 11 November 2008.[34]\n\nThe song \"Kvar i min bil\", written and performed by Per Gessle, resonates repeatedly through the film. Originally an outtake from Gessle's solo album En händig man, the song was specially provided for the film, to resemble the sound of popular 1980s pop group Gyllene Tider.[35] Gessle has described the song as a \"bluesy tune with a nice guitar hook\".[36] Other songs in the film include \"Försonade\" from 1968, written and performed by future ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog,[16] \"Flash in the Night\" from 1981, written by Tim Norell and Björn Håkansson and performed by Secret Service,[16] and \"Dags å välja sida\" by Peps Blodsband.\n\n## Release\n\nLet the Right One In premiered at the Gothenburg Film Festival in Sweden on 26 January 2008[37] where Alfredson won the Festival's Nordic Film Prize.[38] It subsequently played at several other film festivals, including the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City (24 April 2008), where it won the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature;[39] the Edinburgh Film Festival (25 June 2008), where it won the Rotten Tomatoes Critical Consensus Award;[40][41] and the Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival in Switzerland (3 July 2008), where it won the Méliès d'Argent (Silver Méliès).[42]\n\nThe Swedish premiere was originally planned for 18 April 2008, but following the positive response from the festival screenings, the producers decided to postpone the release until autumn, to allow for a longer theatrical run.[43] At one time there was a plan to release the film for a special series of screenings in Luleå, beginning 24 September and lasting seven days. This was canceled when the Swedish Film Institute announced that Everlasting Moments had been selected over Let the Right One In as Sweden's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.[44] The distributors released it on 24 October 2008 in Sweden, Norway, and as a limited release in the United States.[45] In Australia, the film was released on 19 March 2009.[46] The film was released in cinemas in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2009.[47]\n\nThe film was released in North America on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2009 by Magnet Films, and in the United Kingdom in August by Momentum Pictures. The American discs feature both the original Swedish dialogue and an English dubbed version, while the European versions feature only the Swedish, and an audio-descriptive track in English. Icons of Fright reported that the American release had been criticised for using new, oversimplified English subtitles instead of the original theatrical subtitles.[48] Following customer complaints, Magnet stated that they would release an updated version with the original theatrical subtitles, but will not exchange current discs.[49] Director Alfredson also expressed his dissatisfaction with the DVD subtitles, calling it a \"turkey translation\". \"If you look on the 'net, people are furious about how bad it is done\", he added.[50] The UK release retains the theatrical subtitles.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nLet the Right One In has a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The critical consensus reads, \"Let the Right One In reinvigorates the seemingly tired vampire genre by effectively mixing scares with intelligent storytelling\".[51] Additionally, Metacritic has reported an average score of 82 out of 100 based on 30 reviews.[52]\n\nRoger Ebert called the film \"The best modern vampire movie\".[53]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSwedish critics generally expressed positive reactions to the film. In 26 reviews listed at the Swedish-language review site Kritiker.se it achieved an average rating of 4.1 out of 5.[54] Svenska Dagbladet gave the film a rating of five out of six, and hailed Alfredson for his ability to \"tell [stories] through pictures instead of words about a society where hearts are turned to icicles and everyone is left on their own, but also about love warm and red like blood on white melting snow\".[55] Göran Everdahl for SVT's Gomorron Sverige gave the film four out of five and described the film as \"kitchen sink fantasy\" that \"gives the vampire story back something it has been missing for a long time: the ability to really frighten us\".[56] Expressen and Göteborgs-Posten were less impressed and gave the film three out of five. Expressen criticised it for being unappealing to those uninitiated in vampire films while Göteborgs-Posten believed the supporting characters had lost the emotional depth that made the novel so successful.[57][58]\n\nReviewers have commented on the beautiful cinematography and its quiet, restrained approach to the sometimes bloody and violent subject matter.[59] KJ Doughton of Film Threat thought the visuals in the ending were fresh and inventive and would be talked about for years to come.[60] Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, calling it a vampire movie that takes vampires seriously, drawing comparisons to Nosferatu and to Nosferatu the Vampyre. He described it as a story of \"two lonely and desperate kids capable of performing dark deeds without apparent emotion\", and praised the actors for \"powerful\" performances in \"draining\" roles.[61] Ebert later called the film \"The best modern vampire movie\".[53] One negative review came from Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, who gave the movie a \"C\", characterizing it as a \"Swedish head-scratcher\", with \"a few creepy images but very little holding them together\".[62]\n\nBloody Disgusting ranked the film first in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article saying \"It’s rare enough for a horror film to be good; even rarer are those that function as genuine works of art. Let the Right One In is one of those films – an austerely beautiful creation that reveals itself slowly, like the best works of art do.\"[63] The film was ranked #15 in Empire's 2010 list of \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\". In their rationale, the authors noted that, \"in these days where every second movie seems to feature vampires, it takes a very special twist on the legend to surprise us – but this one knocked us out and then bit us in the jugular\", and found that the \"strange central friendship\" between the two lead characters was what made the film \"so frightening, and so magnetic\".[64] In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films; Let the Right One In placed at number 28 on their top 100 list.[65] The film was later voted the 94th greatest film since 2000 in an international critics' poll conducted by BBC.[66]\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nAlfredson received many awards and nominations for his work on the film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlfredson won the Gothenburg Film Festival's Nordic Film Prize as director of Let the Right One In on the grounds that he \"succeeds to transform a vampire movie to a truly original, touching, amusing and heart-warming story about friendship and marginalisation\".[38] Let the Right One In was nominated in five categories for the Swedish Film Institute's 2008 Guldbagge Award, eventually winning for best directing, screenplay and cinematography as well as a Best Achievement-award to production designer Eva Norén.[67] In awarding the film the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature\", the top award at the Tribeca Film Festival, the jury described the film as a \"mesmerizing exploration of loneliness and alienation through masterful reexamination of the vampire myth\".[39] The film also won the Méliès d'Argent (Silver Méliès) at the Swiss Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival[42] (NIFFF) and went on to win the Méliès d'Or (Golden Méliès) for the \"Best European Fantastic Feature Film\", awarded by the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation of which NIFFF is a part.[68] Other awards include the first Rotten Tomatoes Critical Consensus Award at the Edinburgh Film Festival.[41]\n\nDespite being an internationally successful film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion.[69] Being released on 24 October 2008, the film would normally be eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead.[69] When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were canceled. Despite the fact that the film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.[69]\n\n| Award                                              | Date of ceremony    | Category                                     | Recipient(s)                                   |

American version\n\nAfter the release of Let the Right One In took place, Matt Reeves signed on to write and direct an English-language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films.[101] Hammer acquired the rights at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature\", and Overture films planned to release the film in 2010.[102] Alfredson has expressed unhappiness about the idea of a remake, saying that \"remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good, that gives you the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong\" and expressing concern that the result would be too mainstream.[20][103][104] Alfredson was initially asked to helm the remake, but he turned it down stating that \"I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell.\"[105] Lindqvist, in contrast, said that he had heard that Reeves \"will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film\" and so \"it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see.\"[12] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the project as a remake of the film, but later just as \"Reeves' version\".[106] Let Me In was released in late 2010 starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Abby and Owen, Eli's and Oskar's respective counterparts, and received very positive reviews but underperformed at the box office.\n\n## See also\n\n- Vampire film\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Swedish: puss; specifically a small or brief kiss, usually with a closed mouth.[3][4]\n\n##

It is a remake of the 2008 Swedish film Let the Right One In, which was based on the 2004 novel of the same name by John Ajvide Lindqvist.[9] The film stars Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloë Grace Moretz, Elias Koteas, and Richard Jenkins. The plot follows a bullied 12-year-old boy who befriends and develops a romantic relationship with a child vampire girl in Los Alamos, New Mexico, during the early 1980s.\n\nInterest in producing an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007, shortly before the Swedish film was released. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, the director of the original film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version, such as altering the setting from Stockholm to Los Alamos and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009 and concluded in January 2010.\n\nLet Me In premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2010, and was released in the United States on October 1, by Overture Films, and in the United Kingdom on November 5, by Icon Film Distribution. The film received positive reviews from critics, being placed on several top ten lists of best films of the year. Many critics noted it as a rare English-language remake which stayed true to the original, while others criticized it for being too derivative of the Swedish film. It earned $27 million worldwide against a production budget of $20 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn March 1983, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, a disfigured man is taken to the hospital. An unnamed police detective tries to question him about a recent murder. While the detective answers a call outside the room, the disfigured man jumps out of the window, leaving behind a note that reads: \"I'M SORY ABBY\".\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Owen, an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his divorcing parents, sees a barefoot little girl named Abby and an older man moving in next door. At school, a teenage bully named Kenny and two of his friends constantly terrorize Owen, who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth. Abby encourages him to retaliate, and pledges to protect him. Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by Morse code through the walls of their apartments.\n\nAbby's companion Thomas abducts a local teenager and drains the boy's blood into a jug, only to accidentally spill all of its contents. Starving, Abby attacks a neighbor and drinks his blood, killing him and forcing Thomas to dispose of the body.\n\nOn a later night, Thomas hides in the back of another car, but is discovered. In the ensuing struggle, the car falls into a ditch and flips over. Trapped, Thomas pours concentrated sulfuric acid on his face, rendering himself unrecognizable and hospitalizing himself.\n\nAbby learns what happened and visits Thomas in the hospital, who lets her drink his blood before falling to his death. That night, Owen is awakened by Abby, who insists he verbally invite her in. After removing her clothes, she spends the night in his bed and agrees to be his girlfriend.\n\nThe next day, Owen's class goes ice skating on a frozen river. Cornered by the bullies, Owen smashes the side of Kenny’s head with a metal pole, splitting his left ear. At the same moment, the students discover the neighbor's body encased in the ice.\n\nLater, Owen tries to make a blood pact with Abby. Seeing blood, Abby reveals her vampire form and flees, feeding on another neighbor.\n\nThe next night, Abby admits to Owen that she is a vampire and that Thomas was not her father. Owen discovers an aged photo of her with Thomas as a young boy. Scared, Owen wants to leave, but he is stopped by Abby who will not answer his demands on letting him out. Owen finally leaves after asking Abby what she will do to him.\n\nOwen sneaks out to spend the night at Abby's apartment. In the morning, the detective forces his way into Abby's apartment and finds her asleep, only to be distracted by Owen. Abby wakes and attacks the detective, killing him. Horrified at her actions, Abby decides to leave town and kisses a heartbroken Owen goodbye.\n\nDuring swim class, as Kenny and his older brother Jimmy, and their friends ambush Owen and begin to drown him, Abby returns to rescue Owen and dismember his tormentors. An unspecified time later, Owen leaves town on a train, concealing Abby in a large trunk.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Kodi Smit-McPhee as Owen, a 12-year-old bullied schoolboy, later Abby's boyfriend\n- Chloë Grace Moretz as Abby, a vampire who poses as Thomas' daughter, later Owen's girlfriend\n- Elias Koteas as a detective investigating the murders caused by Abby\n    - Koteas also provides the voice of Owen's father\n- Cara Buono as Owen's mother\n- Sasha Barrese as Virginia, one of Abby's victims\n- Richard Jenkins as Thomas, Abby's adult companion\n- Dylan Minnette as Kenny, a bully who torments Owen\n- Ritchie Coster as Mr. Zorić\n- Jimmy Jax Pinchak as Mark, one of Kenny's friends\n- Nicolai Dorian as Donald, one of Kenny's friends\n- Colin Moretz as Cashier\n- Dylan Kenin as Larry, Virginia's boyfriend\n- Brett DelBuono as Jimmy, the older brother of Kenny\n- Chris Browning as Jack, one of Abby's victims\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nAccording to Hammer Films executive producer Nigel Sinclair, interest in the project initially began in the middle of 2007, before the original Let the Right One In had screened for audiences.[10]\n\nThe rights for the English-language film were later acquired by Hammer Films at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the \"Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature,\" and Matt Reeves was quickly introduced as the director.[11] John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation.[12] Tomas Alfredson, the director of the Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that \"I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell.\"[13] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with \"If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats [are there], maybe the scares are a little bit more scary.\"[14] He later said, \"I call it his [Reeves'] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it.\"[15] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film.[16][17] \"If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is,\" he said.[18] Producer Donna Gigliotti said, \"We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, that picture grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia.\"[19] Producer Simon Oakes made it clear that the plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made \"very accessible to a wider audience.\"[14]\n\nWriter John Ajvide Lindqvist, on the other hand, says that Reeves told him that he \"will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film\" and so \"it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see.\"[20] Reeves expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. \"It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book. I think it could be a really touching, haunting and terrifying film. I'm really excited about what it could be\", he said.[21] In response to the criticism he said, \"I can understand because of people's love of the [original] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film. I'm so drawn to it for personal and not mercenary reasons ... I hope people give us a chance.\"[22] When Reeves was initially approached, he at first was against the idea but after reading the novel gained a better appreciation for the story, stating,\n\nI said ... that we shouldn't remake it. I read the book too and was completely taken with it and I was really intrigued how personal the story felt. I thought John Lindqvist had written this terrific story, and he also adapted it for the film ... I wrote Lindqvist and told him that it wasn't just that I was drawn to the story because it was a brilliant genre story—which it is—but also because of the personal aspect of it. It really reminds me of my childhood.[23]\n\n### Adapting and writing\n\nIn adapting the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing the names of the protagonists to Owen and Abby,[24] and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to \"a small New Mexico town.\"[25] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that \"would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely ... we need that childlike innocence.\" He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so \"we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story.\"[23] The filmmakers have noted that \"they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context\", while at the same time paying respect to the original.[25] In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that \"the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book.\" Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating \"There are things that [Lindqvist] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it.\"[23] In adapting the story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's \"evil empire speech\" as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, \"The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets\". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he \"would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [Reagan era] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that.\"[26]\n\n### Casting\n\nMatt Reeves, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Richard Jenkins, and Chloë Grace Moretz at Comic-Con discussing Let Me In.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2009, audition tapes were leaked to the Internet, showing Chloë Grace Moretz, Mary Mouser, and Ariel Winter auditioning for the role of the vampire, Abby.[27] Smit-McPhee, in an interview with The Herald Sun, hinted that he may have landed the role as Owen.[28] The casting of Moretz and Smit-McPhee in the leading roles was confirmed on October 1, 2009, along with the addition of Richard Jenkins as Abby's adult companion.[29]\n\nIn a press release, director Matt Reeves described Smit-McPhee, Moretz and Jenkins as his \"absolute dream cast\", and added that he \"couldn't be more excited to be working with them.\"[30] Both Smit-McPhee and Moretz were cast before the release of The Road or Kick-Ass, and the films' directors John Hillcoat and Matthew Vaughn, respectively, each praised the young actors and recommended them to Reeves.[31]\n\nChloe's older brother, Colin Moretz[32] was also cast in a minor role as the cashier at the convenience store.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in Albuquerque, New Mexico on November 2, 2009.[25][33] Filming took place in several different New Mexico locations, before concluding in Albuquerque in January 2010.[25][34] A large section of the film was filmed at Los Alamos High School in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Los Alamos County granted a special request from the film's director and producer to name the town in the movie \"Los Alamos, New Mexico.\" Over 100 local teenagers were cast as extras.[35]\n\nReeves felt that Lindqvist's story was very naturalistic and wanted the film to be shot the same way. After viewing Bright Star, he hired Greig Fraser as his cinematographer because he admired Fraser's work with natural light on the film.[36] Shortly before filming, Reeves sought advice from Steven Spielberg for directing child actors. Spielberg instructed Reeves to have the two leads each keep a diary in character with the intention of sharing with Reeves what they wrote in it. Reeves stated, \"It was all a process of trying to, not only guide them, but in places, trying to let them guide me toward their perspective. That was important.\"[37]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nMoretz wore minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference (left); visual effects artists later rendered the gradual release of blood in post-production (right).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMethod Studios was contracted to handle the film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production.\n\nSeveral of the film's scenes proved to be a challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the \"car-crash\" sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person.[38][39][40] Several plates were shot, with the first plate involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, and the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a \"rotisserie\" in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's roll down the hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with additional effects work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot.[38][39]\n\nHoudini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, \"Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn't have allowed us enough control.\"[39] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face.[40]\n\n### Music and soundtrack\n\nLet Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the film's soundtrack album. It was released by Varèse Sarabande on October 12, 2010. The score was composed by Michael Giacchino.[41] Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult \"balancing act\" for some scenes. He mentioned, \"I was always trying to say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [Reeves] was like, 'no, put it in!'\" In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, \"... it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary? Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable as far as what everyone's intentions are in the film.[42]\n\n## Release\n\nIt was announced on August 17, 2010, that Let Me In would have its world premiere at Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2010,[43] and its U.S. premiere on the opening night of Fantastic Fest on September 23, 2010.[44] Overture Films released promotional items placed in small plastic evidence bags.[45]\n\n## Reception\n\nChloë Grace Moretz and Elias Koteas during the New York premiere of Let Me In at the SVA Theater on September 30, 2010\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith a budget estimated to be $20 million,[6] the film was released on October 1, 2010, in North America[46] opening at #8 on its debut weekend with an estimated $5.1 million in 2,020 theaters.[47] The film's international release began on October 6 in European markets with other markets following thereafter.[48] During the film's ten-week theatrical run, Let Me In grossed over $24 million worldwide, $12.1 million of which was from the United States and Canada.[6] The film was fifth among the ten lowest-grossing releases of 2010 from major studios (movies released in over 1,500 theaters).[49]\n\n### Critical response\n\nSmit-McPhee and Moretz as Owen and Abby were praised by critics for their chemistry and maturity on-screen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLet Me In received critical acclaim upon release. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 88% based on reviews from 220 critics, with an average score of 7.6/10. The consensus is that \"similar to the original in all the right ways—but with enough changes to stand on its own—Let Me In is the rare Hollywood remake that doesn't add insult to inspiration.\"[50] Let Me In was included on Rotten Tomatoes list of the ten best reviewed wide-release films of 2010[51] in addition to being the best reviewed horror film of 2010.[52] Metacritic gave the film an average score of 79/100 based on 35 reviews, judged to be \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] According to Metacritic, Let Me In was one of the ten best-reviewed wide-release films of 2010, as well as the best reviewed film of the year in the horror category.[54]\n\nParticular praise was given to the film's two leads, Smit-McPhee and Moretz, for their chemistry and maturity on-screen.[55]\n\nAcclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote \"Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years.\"[56] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film \"is more than a respectful remake; Let Me In is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right.\"[57]\n\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote \"what makes Let Me In so eerily fascinating is the mood it creates. It is at once artful and unpretentious, more interested in intimacy and implication than in easy scares or slick effects\".[58] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film while comparing it to the original. He stated, \"Reeves understands what made the first film so eerie and effective, and here the same things work again.\"[59] Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers, who was initially skeptical, gave the film a positive review while writing, \"I thought for sure that any Hollywood remake of Tomas Alfredson's artful Swedish vampire film, Let the Right One In, would be a crass desecration. Well, color me blushing... Prepare to be wowed. It's a spellbinder.\"[60] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating, \"Reeves has Americanized a very good foreign film without defanging it.\"[61]\n\nLet Me In was not well received by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims that he was not remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler of CinemaBlend wrote, \"The movie he's made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it's almost impossible to differentiate between them.\"[62] In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, \"Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in Let Me In than in the Alfredson version.\"[63] Beth Accomando wrote, \"How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original.\" In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake \"makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity\".[64] Mark Kermode called it \"the most utterly redundant remake of the year\".[65]\n\nAccording to Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph, \"Let Me In doesn't need to exist unless, that is, the very notion of Swedish cinema is strange and unpalatable to you ... What's missing is the alluring otherness of Let the Right One In. That film's brittle textures and haunted ambiance seemed in some strange way to have sprung organically from the nation in which it was set. This remake, by contrast, smells of boardrooms and calculating machines.\"[66]\n\nLet Me In was a critics' pick as one of the Top 10 Best Films of 2010 at CNN[67] and at MSN Entertainment for the 2010 Year in Review Special Features.[68]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                                | Category                               | Recipient(s) and nominee(s)    | Result

He said:\n\nI might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. Let the Right One In is a great Swedish movie. Let Me In is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But Let Me In puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. Let Me In is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful. Again.[84]\n\n## Home media\n\nLet Me In was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on February 1, 2011, and in the UK on March 14, 2011.[85] The disc includes an audio commentary with director Reeves, a 17-minute featurette on the making of the film, a short that focuses on the art of the special effects, an in-depth video about the process of making the film's unique car crash scene, three deleted scenes, trailer and poster galleries, and a digital copy of the film. The Blu-ray contains an exclusive featurette titled \"Dissecting Let Me In\".[86] Both the DVD and Blu-ray come with a copy of the limited-edition Let Me In: Crossroads comic book. As of April 2011, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 457,000 units sold with over $6.2 million in revenue.[87]\n\n## Other media\n\nIn April 2010, it was announced that Hammer Films and Dark Horse Comics were producing a four-issue comic book limited series based on the film. Marc Andreyko wrote the comic.[88] The series, titled Let Me In: Crossroads, is a prequel to the film. The first issue has Abby and her \"guardian\" facing a ruthless real-estate tycoon who wants to steal their home and was released in December 2010.[89] John Ajvide Lindqvist, who wrote the original novel that both the Swedish and American films are based upon, said \"Nobody has asked me about [doing a comic] and I think that the project stinks. I am looking into this matter and hope that they have no right to do this.\"[90] Later, he informed fans that he had in fact unwittingly sold the rights for the comic to be made, stating that the producers had misinformed him as to the nature of the contract he had signed.[91]\n\n## See also\n\n- Vampire film\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Let Me In (2010) Production Credits\".

An international co-production between the United Kingdom and Germany, the film focuses on the romance between two vampires and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn 2016, the film was ranked among the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century by 177 critics around the world.[5] In late 2019, it was named the fourth greatest film of the 2010s by The Hollywood Reporter's chief film critic Todd McCarthy.[6]\n\n## Plot\n\nMarried for centuries and now living half a world apart, two vampires wake as the sun goes down. Adam sits holding a lute, in his cluttered Detroit Victorian, as Eve wakes up in her bedroom in Tangier, surrounded by books. Rather than feeding on humans directly, they are dependent on local suppliers of the \"good stuff\", for fear of blood contaminated by the 21st century environment. Adam, still a famous musician, also fears exposure, visiting a local blood bank in the dead of night in disguise as \"Dr. Faust\", bribing \"Dr. Watson\" for his coveted O negative. Eve relies on their old friend, the author Christopher Marlowe, who faked his death in 1593 and now lives under the protection of a protégé.\n\nDespite having influenced the careers of countless famous musicians and scientists, Adam has become withdrawn and suicidal. His desire to reconnect through his music is at odds with the danger of recognition as well as his contempt for the corrupt and foolish humans he refers to as 'zombies'. He spends his nights recording his compositions on outdated studio equipment and lamenting the state of the modern world, while collecting vintage instruments. He pays Ian, a naïve young music fan, to procure vintage guitars and other assorted curiosities, including a custom-made wooden bullet with a brass casing he thinks of using to kill himself. Having acquired much scientific knowledge over the years, Adam has built contraptions to power his home and a vintage sports car with technology originally pioneered by Nikola Tesla. His reclusive nature adds to his mystique as a musician and composer; he is upset when some intrepid fans turn up on his doorstep. Ian promises to discreetly spread rumours about Adam living elsewhere to draw them away.\n\nWhen Eve phones, she recognises Adam is despondent and decides to come to Detroit to comfort him. Soon after she arrives, Adam goes out for more blood, and she discovers his revolver hidden under the bed with the wooden bullet. Her vampire senses reveal to her that the bullet is new, and she is worried. Eve confronts Adam when he returns, chiding him for wasting the life and opportunities he has to enjoy and appreciate the good things in the world, as well as their relationship. They spend their nights cruising the empty streets of Detroit, listening to music and playing chess. Their idyll is shattered by the arrival of Eve's younger sister, Ava, who gorges herself on their stash of the \"good stuff\". Hungry for excitement, Ava persuades them to go out to a local club with Ian, where they hear Adam's music played by the band White Hills. Ava offers Ian a hit off the flask she secretly filled with blood and brought to the club, but Adam snatches it from her with supernatural speed and insists they leave. Before dawn, Ava kills Ian by drinking too much of his blood, and Adam kicks her out of the house.\n\nAdam and Eve dispose of Ian's corpse in an acid pool in an abandoned factory. Ian's murder and the appearance of another group of Adam's fans at the house compel the couple to hastily return to Tangier with only what they can carry onto the plane. Desperately hungry, they visit Marlowe and learn that their old friend and mentor has been poisoned by accidentally drinking contaminated blood. They tease Marlowe about his long ruse, successfully hiding that he produced most of Shakespeare's plays, before he dies. They return to the streets with the last flask of the \"good stuff\". When Eve takes Adam's cash and promises to return with a gift, he is captivated by the music from a nearby club, where Lebanese singer Yasmine Hamdan is finishing a haunting song. Eve reappears with a beautiful oud, and as they sit together contemplating their likely demise, they spot a pair of young lovers kissing. \"What choice do we have?\" Adam remarks; \"I get the girl though.\"\n\n## Cast\n\n- Tilda Swinton as Eve\n- Tom Hiddleston as Adam\n- Mia Wasikowska as Ava\n- Anton Yelchin as Ian\n- Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Watson\n- Slimane Dazi as Bilal\n- John Hurt as Christopher Marlowe\n- Yasmine Hamdan as Yasmine\n- White Hills as themselves\n\n## Production\n\nIn August 2010, Jarmusch said that Tilda Swinton, Michael Fassbender, Mia Wasikowska, and John Hurt had agreed to join the film, described by Jarmusch in May 2011 as a \"crypto-vampire love story\", but he did not have financing yet.[7][8] Financing the film was a difficult process for the director and he explained at the world premiere at the Cannes International Film Festival in May 2013 that \"it's getting more and more difficult for films that are a little unusual, or not predictable, or don't satisfy people's expectations of something\".[9]\n\nJarmusch revealed in 2014 that, after seven years of frustration, Swinton said \"that's good news, it means that now is not the time. It will happen when it needs to happen\".[10] Jarmusch eventually received a US$7 million budget from the German NRW Filmstiftung (de).[9][11] Producer Jeremy Thomas later said that Jarmusch is \"one of the great American independent film-makers – he's the last of the line. People are not coming through like that any more\".[12]\n\nIn January 2012, Tom Hiddleston replaced Fassbender prior to filming.[13] Shooting began that June in numerous locations, the Brush Park district of Detroit, Michigan, U.S., Tangier, Morocco, Hamburg and Cologne in Germany.[14][15][16][17] Filming lasted seven weeks.[18]\n\nThe film is one of several Jarmusch productions, with films such as Night on Earth, in which the action mainly occurs at night. Swinton said after the film's release that \"Jim is pretty much nocturnal, so the nightscape is pretty much his palette. There's something about things glowing in the darkness that feels to me really Jim Jarmusch. He's a rock star\".[12]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nJarmusch's band SQÜRL, primarily responsible for the film's score, opens the film with a version of Wanda Jackson's 1961 song \"Funnel of Love\". Other contributors to the soundtrack are Zola Jesus and Lebanese vocalist Yasmine Hamdan, while Dutch lute player Jozef van Wissem's compositions formed the core of the film's aural aesthetic.[19] During the week of the soundtrack album's release, in April 2014, Van Wissem explained:\n\nI know the way [Jarmusch] makes his films is kind of like a musician. He has music in his head when he's writing a script so it's more informed by a tonal thing than it is by anything else ... I feel that I'm sort of political. Jim's film is anti-contemporary-society. And the lute goes against all technology and against all computers and against all the crap you don't need.[19]\n\nVan Wissem also described the film as \"a very personal film, maybe even autobiographical\" and that \"Jim is a cultural sponge, he absorbs everything\".[12] A concert was held at the Santos Party House venue in New York City in April 2014 to celebrate the release of Jarmusch's eleventh feature film. During the Santos event, Jesus performed with van Wissem on both a \"pseudo-Gregorian\" piece from the film's soundtrack and an unrecorded collaboration.[19]\n\nThe list of songs:\n\n- \"Funnel of Love\" – Wanda Jackson\n- \"Harissa\" – Kasbah Rockers\n- \"Caprice No. 5 in A Minor\" – Charles Yang (composed by Niccolò Paganini)\n- \"Gamil\" – Y.A.S.\n- \"Can't Hardly Stand It\" – Charlie Feathers\n- \"Trapped By a Thing Called Love\" – Denise LaSalle\n- \"Soul Dracula\" – Hot Blood\n- \"Under Skin Or By Name\" – White Hills\n- \"Red Eyes and Tears\" – Black Rebel Motorcycle Club\n- \"Little Village\" – Bill Laswell\n- \"Hal\" – Yasmine Hamdan\n\nCD tracks: Detroit\n\n1.

The implicit vampires (Adam, Eve, and Christopher) are sort of \"secret agents of artistic and intellectual achievement throughout history\", having created art for others like William Shakespeare or Franz Schubert (for whom Adam is said to have written the famous Adagio of the cello string quintet D956, the movement used by Jarmusch in his 2009 film The Limits of Control[20][22]). Early in the film, Adam asserts that seventeenth century musician William Lawes was known for his funeral music, perhaps confusing him with Henry Purcell. Lawes wrote no funeral music, but Purcell famously did.\n\n### The title\n\nThe title pays tribute to the Dave Wallis science fiction novel of the same name from 1964, although the plots have no similarities. A film adaptation was planned in the mid-1960s for director Nicholas Ray (a picture of him can later be seen in the film) starring The Rolling Stones.[23][24]\n\n### Names\n\nThe names \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" can easily be inferred to allude to the biblical creation story but Jarmusch revealed he was originally referring to Mark Twain's satirical work The Diaries of Adam and Eve.[13]\n\nFor her flight from Tangier to Detroit Eve uses the surname \"Fibonacci\", taken from the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci.[20] On their flights to Tangier they use the names Stephen Dedalus (from James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses) and Daisy Buchanan (from F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby).[20] On his two visits to Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright) Adam's name tag shows \"Dr. Faust\" (from the German legend of Faust, from which Marlowe wrote the play The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus). During his visits, Watson jokingly calls him \"Dr. Strangelove\" (the eponymous character in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove) and \"Dr. Caligari\" (an homage to the German silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari).[20][25]\n\n### Music equipment and technology\n\nParallel to Adam's fondness for vintage instruments and audio equipment, Jarmusch originally planned shooting the movie on analog film; budgetary considerations however forced the use of a digital Arri Alexa Plus with Cooke S4 lenses. Only vinyl (mostly singles) are played and analogue recording is used.[20] The film opens with a view of a ten-course renaissance lute (credited as built by Michael Schreiner of Toronto). Adam receives four guitars in the beginning from Ian:[20]\n\n- a white 1959 Supro (then manufactured by Valco), which he names after William Lawes\n- a silverblue 1966 Hagström\n- an \"early sixties\" Silvertone in black\n- a red Gretsch 6120 \"Chet Atkins\"; Adam once saw Eddie Cochran play one\n\nLater, a 1905 Gibson L2 is shown while other guitars, violins and cellos can be seen in Adam's studio.[21] Among Adam's recording equipment is a Premier drum set, a Telefunken and Revox tape recorder, a Marshall and Fender amps. Eve and her sister are more adapted to modern technology. To communicate via Skype with her lover, Eve uses her iPhone while Adam sets up a laptop connected to a wood-cabinet tube television.[20] Ava uses YouTube to watch the music video of \"Soul Dracula\" by the French band Hot Blood.\n\n### Literature\n\nAmong the books Eve reads and packs for her trip to Detroit are:[21][26]\n\n- Los Pequeños Poemas by Ramón de Campoamor y Campoosorio\n- Endgame by Samuel Beckett\n- Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace\n- Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes\n- The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima\n- The Bastard of Istanbul by Elif Şafak\n- The Adventures of Captain Hatteras by Jules Verne\n- Basquiat edited by Sam Keller and Dieter Buchhart\n- Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto\n- Zwischen zwei Revolutionen by Ernst Heilborn\n- The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka\n- \"Man of Paper\", from روايات عبير  (Arabic versions of Harlequin novels) by Carole Mortimer\n- A volume of the love poetry by the Arab poet Umar ibn Abi Rabi'ah and a picture of Lorenzo Ghiberti's \"La Creazione di Adamo e di Eva\" from his Porta del Paradiso.\n\nReferring to the story that Christopher Marlowe may have faked his death and then written under the pseudonym of William Shakespeare, Marlow tells Eve that Adam would have been the perfect inspiration for his Hamlet.[21]\n\n### Scientists and inventors\n\nThe mentioned scientists (and one engineer) Adam adores are: Pythagoras, Galileo Galilei, Nicolaus Copernicus, Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Albert Einstein.[27]\n\nEve flies to Detroit on the fictional airline \"Air Lumière\"; the name is allusion to Auguste and Louis Lumière.\n\n### Wall of fame\n\nWhile Adam often mentions that he has no \"heroes\", opposite his bed the wall is covered with pictures of personalities, which include:\n\n- musicians: Henry Purcell , Johann Sebastian Bach , Franz Schubert , Gustav Mahler , Charley Patton , Billie Holiday , Hank Williams , Bo Diddley , Thelonious Monk , John Coltrane , Patti Smith , Chrissie Hynde , Frank Zappa and Jimi Hendrix .\n    - among them the Jarmusch associates Tom Waits (Down by Law, Night on Earth, Mystery Train, Coffee and Cigarettes, and The Dead Don't Die), Iggy Pop (Dead Man, Coffee and Cigarettes, The Dead Don't Die), Joe Strummer (Mystery Train), RZA (Ghost Dog, Coffee and Cigarettes, and The Dead Don't Die) and Neil Young (Dead Man)\n- writers: William Blake (mentioned in Dead Man), Christopher Marlowe, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, John Keats, Jane Austen, Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Rimbaud, Emily Dickinson, Charles Baudelaire, Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, Mark Twain, Samuel Beckett and William S. Burroughs\n- others: Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla (the first which can be seen), Nicholas Ray, Luis Buñuel, Rodney Dangerfield, Buster Keaton, Rumi, Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Harpo Marx, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Marcel Duchamp[12][20][21][25][28]\n\n### Places\n\nThe home of Adam is originally located at 82 Alfred Street, Detroit. When the protagonists are cruising around the neighbourhood, Adam shows Eve the Michigan Theater, which is now a parking deck, and the place where Jack White grew up with his family.[28] White previously played a Tesla expert in Coffee and Cigarettes.\n\n## Release\n\nCast and director at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film was shown in several film festivals during 2013, such as the Cannes Film Festival in the competition section in April,[29] the September Toronto International Film Festival,[30] four screenings at the September/October Reykjavík International Film Festival,[31] and as an opening film for the 4th American Film Festival held in Wrocław, Poland.[32]\n\nThe film was officially released in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2014,[33] and opened in the United States on 11 April the same year.[34]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 210 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Worth watching for Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton's performances alone, Only Lovers Left Alive finds writer-director Jim Jarmusch adding a typically offbeat entry to the vampire genre.\"[35] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[36]\n\nScott A. Gray of Exclaim! gave the film 8 out of 10, calling it \"a visually poetic love story with a wry, jaded sense of humour about finding reasons to wake up every night\".[37] Calum Marsh of Slant Magazine gave it 3 out of 4 stars.[38] Jonathan Romney of Screen International commented that it is Jarmusch's most poetic film since Dead Man.[39]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter described the film as \"the perennial downtown filmmaker's best work in many years, probably since 1995's Dead Man, with which it shares a sense of quiet, heady, perilous passage\".[40] Jonathan Hatfull of SciFiNow wrote that it is Jarmusch's best film since Ghost Dog.[41]\n\nRobbie Collin from The Daily Telegraph awarded the film 4 out of 5 stars and praised the performances of Swinton and Hiddleston: \"In the time-honoured Jarmuschian fashion, the few things that happen in Only Lovers Left Alive happen very slowly, but the dialogue is always gloomily amusing, and Swinton and Hiddleston's delivery of the gags is as cold and crisp as footsteps in fresh snow\".[42] Jessica Kiang of IndieWire gave the film a B+ grade, saying, \"The real pleasure of the film is in its languid droll cool and its romantic portrayal of the central couple, who are now our number one role models in the inevitable event of us turning vampiric.\"[43]\n\nTim Grierson of Paste noted that \"Hiddleston and Swinton play their characters not as blasé hipsters but, rather, deeply reflective, almost regretful old souls who seem to have decided that love is about the only thing you can count on\".[44] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, pointing that Adam and Eve look more like \"well-born incestuous siblings\" in spite of being lovers, while the Observer's Jonathan Romney concluded that the film is \"a droll, classy piece of cinematic dandyism that makes the Twilight cycle redundant in one exquisitely languid stroke\".[45][46]\n\nKurt Halfyard of Twitch Film commented: \"Retro recording equipment hasn't looked this claustrophobically sexy since Berberian Sound Studio\".[47] Alfred Joyner of International Business Times felt that \"the melancholy that permeates Motown in the film could be seen as Jarmusch's take on the loss of America's greatness in the 21st century\".[48]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                         | Category           | Recipients and nominees    | Result    | Ref(s)    |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cannes Film Festival          | Palme d'Or         | —                          | Nominated | [49][50]  |\n| Cannes Film Festival          | Soundtrack Award   | —                          | Won       |           |\n| Sitges Film Festival          | Special Jury Prize | —                          | Won       | [51]      |\n| Independent Spirit Awards     | Best Female Lead   | Tilda Swinton              | Nominated | [52]      |\n| Independent Spirit Awards     | Best Screenplay    | Jim Jarmusch               | Nominated |           |\n| Saturn Awards                 | Best Horror Film   | —                          | Nominated |           |\n| Vancouver Film Critics Circle | Best Actress       | Tilda Swinton              | Won       |           |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE (15)\".

The film stars Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald, two morbid teenage sisters whose relationship is tested when Ginger (who has started her period for the first time) is attacked and bitten by an unknown animal, and then later, during the next full moon, slowly starts to transform into a werewolf. The supporting cast features Kris Lemche, Jesse Moss, Danielle Hampton, John Bourgeois, Peter Keleghan, and Mimi Rogers.\n\nAfter premiering at the Munich Fantasy Filmfest in August 2000 and screening at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival, Ginger Snaps received a limited theatrical release in May 2001. Despite modest box office receipts, the film was a critical success. It has since amassed a cult following and has been reexamined for its feminist themes.[4][5] It was followed by a sequel, Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed, and a prequel, Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning, which were filmed back-to-back and both released in 2004.\n\n## Plot\n\nA rash of dog killings strikes the quiet suburb of Bailey Downs, Ontario. Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death. As children, they formed a pact to move out of the suburb or die together by the age of 16. One night, while on their way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period. The scent of blood results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature bites Ginger and as the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer. Ginger foregoes going to the hospital because her wound has already healed.\n\nFollowing the attack, Ginger undergoes transformations that concern Brigitte. She begins behaving aggressively, hair grows from her scars, she sprouts a tail, and menstruates heavily. Ignoring Brigitte's warnings, Ginger has unprotected sex with classmate Jason McCardy. Later, she furiously beats Trina in public and kills a neighbor's dog. Brigitte seeks out Sam to obtain information on what his van struck, and they agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is transforming into one. After a silver navel piercing proves ineffective as a remedy, Sam suggests infusing an extract of monkshood, also known as wolfsbane, a perennial plant often referred to in lycanthrope folklore.\n\nTrina appears at the Fitzgerald home and accuses Ginger of kidnapping her dog. As Ginger and Trina struggle, Trina dies accidentally when she slips and strikes her head upon the kitchen counter. The sisters hide the body in a freezer. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers while removing her body to bury it, and the fingers are misplaced. On Halloween, Brigitte brings monkshood to Sam and he creates an extract of the herb. Brigitte is attacked by an infected Jason, and defends herself by using the monkshood syringe on him. His behavior suddenly changes, proving that the cure works. At school, she discovers Ginger's murder of the counselor and witnesses her killing the janitor. Ginger discloses her intent to target Sam next at the Greenhouse Bash, a Halloween party hosted by him.\n\nThe girls' mother discovers the fingers and Trina's corpse. She drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, telling her that she will erase the evidence of Trina's death by burning their house down. Brigitte arrives to find Sam fending off a nearly-turned Ginger. Brigitte wounds Ginger's and her own palm and clasps their hands together, infecting herself with Ginger's blood. She convinces Ginger of her loyalty and willingness to help her. As the sisters leave, Brigitte decides to abandon her mother. As Ginger feels her transformation approaching, Sam knocks her unconscious with a shovel. They take Ginger back home to prepare more of the cure for her.\n\nOn the way, Ginger fully transforms into a werewolf and escapes from the van. Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as Sam makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, she mutilates him. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, Brigitte tries to save him by drinking his blood to calm Ginger, but is unable to go through with it. Ginger senses Brigitte's insincerity and kills Sam. As Ginger chases Brigitte, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Brigitte defends herself while holding the syringe in one hand and a knife in the other. Ginger lunges at Brigitte and into the knife, fatally wounding herself. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and weeps.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Emily Perkins as Brigitte Fitzgerald\n- Katharine Isabelle as Ginger Fitzgerald\n- Kris Lemche as Sam\n- Mimi Rogers as Pamela Fitzgerald\n- Jesse Moss as Jason McCardy\n- Danielle Hampton as Trina Sinclair\n- John Bourgeois as Henry Fitzgerald\n- Peter Keleghan as Mr. Wayne, a teacher and guidance counselor at Bailey Downs High School\n- Christopher Redman as Ben\n- Jimmy MacInnis as Tim\n- Lindsay Leese as Nurse Ferry, the school nurse\n- Wendii Fulford as Ms. Sykes, the Bailey Downs High School gym and field hockey teacher\n- Ann Baggley as mother\n- Graeme Robertson and Maxwell Robertson as toddler\n- Pak-Kong Ho as janitor\n- Bryon Bully as hockey kid\n- Steven Taylor as puppy kid\n\nNick Nolan portrayed both the initial werewolf (nicknamed \"the Beast of Bailey Downs\" by the town's residents) and the \"Gingerwolf\", the werewolf which Ginger becomes.[6][better source needed]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector John Fawcett has said: \"I knew that I wanted to make a metamorphosis movie and a horror film. I also knew that I wanted to work with girls\".[7] In January 1995, he talked to screenwriter Karen Walton, who was initially reluctant to write the script due to the horror genre's reputation for weak characters, poor storytelling, and a negative portrayal of women. However, Fawcett convinced Walton the film would re-interpret the genre.[7] Walton has said, \"a lot of werewolf movies seemed very much the same. My favourite was of course An American Werewolf in London, because it was at least a little punk about it, but it was still two white dudes grappling with the beast inside of them... I love stories that work on a lot of different levels, for a whole bunch of different kinds of people. That it turned out to be OK in the marketplace as just one girl's voice – and a director who really wanted to support that – is remarkable, I think, for the day\".[5]\n\nFawcett and Walton encountered trouble financing the film. They approached producer Steve Hoban, with whom they had worked before, and he agreed to produce the film. Hoban employed Ken Chubb to edit and polish the story, and after two years they were ready to seek financiers.[7]\n\nMotion International committed to co-financing and Canadian distribution, and Trimark Pictures agreed to be the co-financier, U.S. distributor, and international sales agent.[7] The film seemed ready to go into production by fall of 1998; however, negotiations with Trimark caused the producers to miss the budgeting deadline for Telefilm Canada, the Canadian federal film funding agency. Rather than go ahead with only 60% of the funding, Hoban decided to wait a year for Telefilm's funding. During this interval, Trimark dropped the film. Lionsgate Films, who Trimark would end up merging with in 2000, took Trimark's place, and Unapix Entertainment agreed to distribute the film on DVD, along with Artisan Entertainment for the American DVD release.[7] The film's budget was $4.5 million.[2]: 16\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting the two leads met with substantial difficulty. While a casting director was easily found for Los Angeles, Canadian casting directors proved to be appalled by the horror, gore, and language. When one finally agreed to pick up the film, the Columbine shooting and another school shooting in Alberta suddenly thrust the public spotlight on violent teenagers. The Toronto Star's announcement that Telefilm was funding a \"teen slasher movie\" met with a flurry of debate and outrage in the media, which generated a significant amount of adverse publicity in proportion to the size of the project.[7][8]\n\nCasting took place in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Perkins and Isabelle auditioned on the same day at their agency in Vancouver, reading to one another off-camera. When their taped auditions arrived, screenwriter Karen Walton said that they were exactly as she had pictured the characters.[7]\n\nCoincidentally, both actresses were born in the same hospital, attended the same preschool, elementary, and private schools, and are at the same agency. Perkins was twenty-two at the time and Isabelle four years younger, but Perkins was cast as the younger sister.\n\nAttention then turned to the next most important characters: the drug dealer and the mother roles. Mimi Rogers readily agreed to play the mother, Pamela, saying that she liked the black humour and comic relief in the role.[7] Robin Cook, the Canadian casting director, put forward one of her favourites, Kris Lemche, for the role of drug dealer Sam. After seeing Kris's audition, Fawcett hired him.[7]\n\nIn 2021, Fawcett revealed that Scarlett Johansson was originally offered the role of Brigitte, but her mother did not want her involved after reading a National Post article about a boycott of the film by casting directors in Canada.[9]\n\n### Shooting\n\nKatharine Isabelle having a facial prosthetic applied.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography took place between October 25 and December 6, 1999, lasting a little over six weeks. Three of Toronto's suburbs, Etobicoke, Brampton (Kris Lemche's hometown), and Scarborough served as the suburb of Bailey Downs.[7] Shooting outside during Toronto's winter for sixteen hours a day, six days a week meant that sicknesses would make their rounds through the cast and crew every few weeks.[7][10]\n\nOn the first day of shooting in the suburbs, all the still photographs for the title sequence were created. The bloody, staged deaths drew a crowd and Fawcett worried about upsetting the neighbours.[7] The girls were covered in fake blood for the shots, and at the time, a homeowner's basement served as their changing room. Each time they needed to change, someone had to distract the homeowner's four-year-old child.[10]\n\nLong shooting days pushed the earliest possible start later each day until the scenes written for day were being shot after late into the night. Director of photography Thom Best solved the problem by using diffusion gel and four eighteen kilowatt lamps which generated enough light to be seen a mile high in the sky.[7]\n\nThe special effects proved to be a major hardship, as Fawcett eschewed CGI effects and preferred to use more traditional means of prosthetics and make-up. Consequently, Isabelle had to spend up to seven hours in the makeup chair to create Ginger's metamorphosis and a further two hours to remove them.[10] Often covered in sticky fake blood that required Borax and household detergent to remove, she further endured wearing contacts that hindered her vision and teeth that meant she could not speak without a lisp. The most aggravating thing was the full facial prosthetic which gave her a permanently runny nose that she had to stop with cotton swabs.[7]\n\n### Post-production\n\nBeginning in December 1999, Brett Sullivan worked with Fawcett for eight weeks to create the final cut of the film.[7] Despite the short time for editing, the film was nominated for a Genie in editing.[11] Despite a similarly tight schedule in the sound department, the film would also be nominated for a Genie in sound editing.[11]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack was released on Roadrunner Records.\n\n|   No. | Title                                 | Artist                         | Length   |\n|-------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Inside You\"                          | Godhead                        | 3:31     |\n|     2 | \"Pipe Dream\"                          | Project 86                     | 4:35     |\n|     3 | \"Siberian Kiss\"                       | Glassjaw                       | 3:50     |\n|     4 | \"The Silent Acquiescence of Millions\" | Sinch                          | 8:44     |\n|     5 | \"Temple from the Within\"              | Killswitch Engage              | 3:45     |\n|     6 | \"First Commandment\"                   | Soulfly featuring Chino Moreno | 4:29     |\n|     7 | \"Cloning Technology\"                  | Fear Factory                   | 5:52     |\n|     8 | \"A Night Like This\"                   | Professional Murder Music      | 3:28     |\n|     9 | \"Desire to Fire\"                      | Machine Head                   | 4:49     |\n|    10 | \"Burial for the Living\"               | Hatebreed                      | 1:40     |\n|    11 | \"Pin Cushion\"                         | Saliva                         | 4:49     |\n|    12 | \"Of One Blood\"                        | Shadows Fall                   | 4:45     |\n|    13 | \"Action Radius\"                       | Junkie XL                      | 3:53     |\n|    14 | \"Her Ghost in the Fog\"                | Cradle of Filth                | 6:24     |\n\n|   No. | Title                                        | Artist          | Length   |\n|-------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------|\n|    15 | \"Ginger Snaps - Opening\"                     | Michael Shields | 2:10     |\n|    16 | \"Ginger Snaps Theme Song (no sound effects)\" | Michael Shields | 3:00     |\n\n## Release\n\nGinger Snaps premiered at the Munich Fantasy Filmfest in August 2000. The following month, it played at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it briefly received media attention following the positive word-of-mouth it had built up from Munich. Although called one of the stand-outs of the Toronto festival, attention died off and the film followed an unfocused release strategy, playing at various film festivals and building up more word-of-mouth.[2]: 86–87  Ginger Snaps was released to Canadian cinemas in May 2001. It grossed CAD $425,753 domestically, making it the fifth highest-grossing Canadian film between December 2000 and November 2001.[12] Owing to a cult following, it has achieved significant video and DVD sales. These earnings, combined with moderate theatrical success abroad, led to the production of two further films.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe film has a 90% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 61 reviews; the average rating is 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"The strong female cast and biting satire of teenage life makes Ginger Snaps far more memorable than your average werewolf movie – or teen flick\".[13] Critics' praise was centered on the quality of acting by the two leads, the horrific metamorphosis reminiscent of Cronenberg,[14][15] the use of lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty, and the dark humour.[16][17][18][19] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the film was \"seemingly left for dead\" after playing at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival but is now considered a cult film.[20] It is ranked 78 on Time Out London's list of 100 best horror films, Tom Huddleston calling it \"the best teenage werewolf movie, period\".[21]\n\nCritics who panned the film thought the puberty metaphor was too obvious, the characters too over-the-top (especially the mother), and the dark humour and horror elements unbalanced.[22][23]\n\nBecause the film links lycanthropy to menstruation and features two sisters, Ginger Snaps lends itself to a feminist critique. Feminist scholar Bianca Nielsen wrote: \"By simultaneously depicting female bonds as important and fraught with difficulties, Ginger Snaps portrays the double-binds teenage girls face. Ginger is an embodiment of these impossible binaries: she is at once sexually attractive and monstrous, 'natural' and 'supernatural', human and animal, 'feminine' and transgressive, a sister and a rival\".[24]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                         | Ceremony[a]        | Category                                       | Recipient(s)                                                                                        | Result    | Ref.     |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Toronto International Film Festival           | September 17, 2000 | Best Canadian Film - Special Jury Citation     | Ginger Snaps                                                                                        | Won       | [25]     |\n| Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema | February 28, 2001  | Best Feature Film                              | Ginger Snaps (John Fawcett, director)                                                               | Won       | [26][25] |\n| Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema | February 28, 2001  | Best Special Effects                           | Ginger Snaps                                                                                        | Won       | [26][25] |\n| Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema | February 28, 2001  | Best Actress                                   | Emily Perkins                                                                                       | Won       | [26][25] |\n| Toronto Film Critics Association Awards       | December 20, 2001  | Best Canadian Film                             | Ginger Snaps (John Fawcett, director)                                                               | Nominated | [27][28] |\n| Vancouver Film Critics Circle                 | January 31, 2002   | Best Canadian Film                             | Ginger Snaps                                                                                        | Nominated | [29][30] |\n| Vancouver Film Critics Circle                 | January 31, 2002   | Best Actress in a Canadian Film                | Katharine Isabelle                                                                                  | Nominated | [29][30] |\n| Genie Awards                                  | February 7, 2002   | Achievement in Cinematography                  | Thom Best                                                                                           | Nominated | [11][31] |\n| Genie Awards                                  | February 7, 2002   | Achievement in Editing                         | Brett C.

Consequently, Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning went direct-to-video.[37] In October 2020, a television series was announced to be in development.[38]\n\nThe 2009 film Jennifer's Body draws frequent comparisons to Ginger Snaps. Their plots, and the relationship between the two main female characters, are strikingly similar in many ways. Despite this, Jennifer's Body writer Diablo Cody and director Karyn Kusama have controversially not referenced it as an influence.[39]\n\nThe music video for Sabrina Carpenter's \"Taste\" features a visual reference to the scene where a character is impaled by a white picket fence.[40]\n\nThe album WLFGIRL by Machine Girl samples Ginger Snaps on several tracks, those being \"Out by 16, Dead on the Scene\", \"Ginger Claps\", \"Excruciating Death (phase γ)\", and \"Phase α\".[41]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of cult films\n\n## Explanatory notes\n\n- ^ Each date is linked to the article about the awards held that year, wherever possible.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"GINGER SNAPS (18)\".

The film stars <Themes>Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald, two morbid teenage sisters whose relationship is tested when Ginger (who has started her period for the first time) is attacked and bitten by an unknown animal, and then later, during the next full moon, slowly starts to transform into a werewolf.</Themes> \n\nThe film premiered at the Munich Fantasy Filmfest in <ReleaseYear>August 2000</ReleaseYear> and received a limited theatrical release in May 2001. Despite modest box office receipts, the film was a critical success. It has since amassed a cult following and has been reexamined for its feminist themes. \n\n## Plot\n\nA rash of dog killings strikes the quiet suburb of Bailey Downs, Ontario. Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death. As children, they formed a pact to move out of the suburb or die together by the age of 16. One night, while on their way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period. The scent of blood results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature bites Ginger and as the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer. Ginger foregoes going to the hospital because her wound has already healed.\n\nFollowing the attack, Ginger undergoes transformations that concern Brigitte. She begins behaving aggressively, hair grows from her scars, she sprouts a tail, and menstruates heavily. Ignoring Brigitte's warnings, Ginger has unprotected sex with classmate Jason McCardy. Later, she furiously beats Trina in public and kills a neighbor's dog. Brigitte seeks out Sam to obtain information on what his van struck, and they agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is transforming into one. After a silver navel piercing proves ineffective as a remedy, Sam suggests infusing an extract of monkshood, also known as wolfsbane, a perennial plant often referred to in lycanthrope folklore.\n\nTrina appears at the Fitzgerald home and accuses Ginger of kidnapping her dog. As Ginger and Trina struggle, Trina dies accidentally when she slips and strikes her head upon the kitchen counter. The sisters hide the body in a freezer. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers while removing her body to bury it, and the fingers are misplaced. On Halloween, Brigitte brings monkshood to Sam and he creates an extract of the herb. Brigitte is attacked by an infected Jason, and defends herself by using the monkshood syringe on him. His behavior suddenly changes, proving that the cure works. At school, she discovers Ginger's murder of the counselor and witnesses her killing the janitor. Ginger discloses her intent to target Sam next at the Greenhouse Bash, a Halloween party hosted by him.\n\nThe girls' mother discovers the fingers and Trina's corpse. She drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, telling her that she will erase the evidence of Trina's death by burning their house down. Brigitte arrives to find Sam fending off a nearly-turned Ginger. Brigitte wounds Ginger's and her own palm and clasps their hands together, infecting herself with Ginger's blood. She convinces Ginger of her loyalty and willingness to help her. As the sisters leave, Brigitte decides to abandon her mother. As Ginger feels her transformation approaching, Sam knocks her unconscious with a shovel. They take Ginger back home to prepare more of the cure for her.\n\nOn the way, Ginger fully transforms into a werewolf and escapes from the van. Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as Sam makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, she mutilates him. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, Brigitte tries to save him by drinking his blood to calm Ginger, but is unable to go through with it. Ginger senses Brigitte's insincerity and kills Sam. As Ginger chases Brigitte, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Brigitte defends herself while holding the syringe in one hand and a knife in the other. Ginger lunges at Brigitte and into the knife, fatally wounding herself. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and weeps.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe film has a 90% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 61 reviews; the average rating is 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"The strong female cast and biting satire of teenage life makes Ginger Snaps far more memorable than your average werewolf movie – or teen flick\". Critics' praise was centered on the quality of acting by the two leads, the horrific metamorphosis reminiscent of Cronenberg, the use of lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty, and the dark humour. \n\nCritics who panned the film thought the puberty metaphor was too obvious, the characters too over-the-top (especially the mother), and the dark humour and horror elements unbalanced. Because the film links lycanthropy to menstruation and features two sisters, Ginger Snaps lends itself to a feminist critique. Feminist scholar Bianca Nielsen wrote: \"By simultaneously depicting female bonds as important and fraught with difficulties, Ginger Snaps portrays the double-binds teenage girls face. Ginger is an embodiment of these impossible binaries: she is at once sexually attractive and monstrous, 'natural' and 'supernatural', human and animal, 'feminine' and transgressive, a sister and a rival\".\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have inserted the relevant XML tags according to the attributes specified in the ADT while maintaining the original content and meaning of the article.",

Not to give too much away, as it's really worth seeking out! Such a kool movie and the main actress really suits the role, as one demented psychopath. The strength of the film lies within both the credible performances and a rather interesting plot.\n\n- RatedVforVinny\n- Feb 12, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ20\n\n- How long is May?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - April 11, 2003 (Denmark)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Muñeca diabólica\n- Filming locations\n    - Auto Body Shop, 2022 Hyperion Ave., Los Angeles, California, USA(Adam's place of employment)\n- Production companies\n    - 2 Loop Films\n    - A Loopy Production LLC\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $500,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $150,277\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $34,989\n    - Feb 9, 2003\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $264,349\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 33 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby SR\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nBy what name was May (2002) officially released in India in Hindi?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is an adaptation of Mitch Cullin's novel of the same name. The film was shot in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and the surrounding area in late 2004. The world premiere was at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival where the film received a mixed response from both viewers and critics. After little interest from U.S. distributors, THINKFilm picked the film up for a U.S. release date in October 2006. Despite the film's eclectic and unconventional themes, which included child abuse, decomposition, incest, flatulence, mental illnesses and heroin usage, Tideland featured a number of notable actors, including Jennifer Tilly, Jeff Bridges, and Janet McTeer.\n\n## Plot\n\nJeliza-Rose has solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks. The girl creates an increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape.\n\nAfter her mother overdoses on methadone, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Before they leave, however, Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid.\n\nDuring Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy (which Dell and Dickens did to their own dead mother). Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the \"Monster Shark\" he believes is roaming the countryside. The Monster Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside. It is also revealed that Dell and Noah were once \"kissers\", as Jeliza-Rose finds pictures of the two in the room Dell shares with her own taxidermied mother.\n\nAt the end of the film, following a violent confrontation between Dell, Dickens and Jeliza-Rose, a train wreck is caused by Dickens' dynamite, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse. Wandering about the wreckage, and among the confusion of injured travelers, Jeliza-Rose is discovered by a woman who survived, and she assumes the little girl is also a victim of the train wreck. The film ends with the woman embracing Jeliza-Rose, who stares with stunned confusion at the wreckage.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Jodelle Ferland as Jeliza-Rose\n- Brendan Fletcher as Dickens\n- Janet McTeer as Dell\n- Jennifer Tilly as Queen Gunhilda, Jeliza-Rose's mother\n- Jeff Bridges as Noah, Jeliza-Rose's father\n- Dylan Taylor as Patrick\n- Wendy Anderson as Woman / Squirrel\n- Sally Crooks as Dell's mother[3]\n\n## Production\n\nTideland, despite being set in rural Texas, was filmed in the prairies of western Canada, with interiors shot in Saskatchewan. Terry Gilliam was enamoured by the original novel by Mitch Cullin, having discovered the book in a stack of unread books on his desk in 2001. He described the novel as \"funny, touching and disturbing all at the same time\".\n\nThe film's crew had initial trouble financing the film, but they were eventually able to get things in order. Rather than Jeliza-Rose narrating the story in first-person as in the novel, the screenplay was written in third person.\n\nQu'Appelle Valley served as the location for the decrepit house of Dell and Dickens, and also for Noah's old family home where he takes Jeliza-Rose. The harsh Canadian weather meant that the crew had to rush to finish the film before conditions became too difficult. Casting Jeliza-Rose was also difficult; roughly 400 Canadian girls auditioned for the role, none of whom Gilliam felt had \"a real soul\" for the character. A VHS tape from Vancouver was submitted that featured Jodelle Ferland, whom Gilliam agreed was perfect for the role. While acting in the Stephen King miniseries Kingdom Hospital, Ferland prepared for her upcoming role as Jeliza-Rose. Jennifer Tilly, who played Jeliza-Rose's morbidly obese, abusive mother, wore excess padding to make herself appear overweight, but for the most part the chosen cast merely relied on makeup and behavioural mannerisms to accentuate their characters.\n\nProduction designer Jasna Stefanovic, who worked on most of the aesthetics and sets for Tideland, took heavy inspiration from Andrew Wyeth paintings and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. While the film portrayed disturbing and grotesque scenes of taxidermy and a trapped live squirrel, no animals were actually harmed during the production.[4]\n\n## Release\n\nTideland was released in theatres in 2006, but had first appeared in the autumn of 2005 at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival.[5] The film was later released on DVD video in 2006–2007 in various countries, and a streaming version exists on Apple TV.[6]\n\n## Critical reception\n\nJeremy Thomas (left) and Terry Gilliam at San Sebastián Film Festival 2005. Press conference on Tideland.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Spain's 2005 San Sebastian Festival, Tideland was awarded the FIPRESCI Prize,[7] selected by an international jury of critics[8] who, in their award statement, said: \"Our jury focused on the international competition and found Terry Gilliam's Tideland to be the best film of the selection—a decision which provoked controversial reactions.\"[9] The jury consisted of Andrei Plakhov, Russia, President (Kommersant), Julio Feo Zarandieta, France (Radio France Internationale), Wolfgang Martin Hamdorf, Germany (Film-Dienst), Massimo Causo, Italy (Corriere Del Giorno), and Sergi Sanchez, Spain (La Razón).[8]\n\nIn response to the controversy surrounding the film's FIPRESCI win at San Sebastian, jurist Sergi Sanchez wrote:  \"Gilliam's was the only one that dared to propose a risky and radical image, without any concessions, on a specific matter: madness as the only way of escaping in the face of a hostile environment. All this is endlessly coherent with the director's body of work, which has been frequently misunderstood by the critics, the industry, and audiences alike.\"  Defending Gilliam's film while also placing it in the context of the director's previous works, as well as explaining the jury's decision, Sanchez concluded by stating, \"Fighting against windmills is, after all, the same as fighting against the prejudices that trap creative freedom.\"[10]\n\nThe subsequent mainstream reviews of Tideland were mixed, with Japan being the only country where it was both a critical and box office success.[11] The film was first released in Russia (February 2006) followed by the Netherlands (March 2006) and Greece (May 2006).[12] After almost a year without any US distribution, the film was picked up for American release by THINKFilm, and subsequently opened in the US, earning just $7,276 from one theater during its first week run. The film's release was then expanded, but to only nine theatres, for a total domestic gross of $66,453.[13] Since then, several independent cinemas and art museums have presented the film as a special event, including IFC Center and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.[14]\n\nGilliam has openly criticized THINKFilm for the manner in which the company handled the American theatrical release of the film,[15] and their unauthorized tampering with the aspect ratio of the film for its US DVD release. He has also gone on record as saying that nearly all his films have initially garnered mixed reactions from critics, and in at least one interview, as well as in the introduction to Tideland, he has stated that he believes many moviegoers will hate Tideland, others will love it, and some just would not know what to think about it.[16] Gilliam has also said that Michael Palin, another former member of Monty Python, had told him that the film was either the best thing he had ever done, or the worst—although Palin himself could not quite decide either way.[17]\n\nEntertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave Tideland an \"F\",[18] calling it \"gruesomely awful\". In the subsequent review of the DVD release, Gleiberman's fellow Entertainment Weekly critic Clark Collis gave the film a \"B\"[19] and stated: \"Terry Gilliam's grim fairy tale is another fantastic(al) showcase for his visual talents.\"[19]\n\nThe film received a \"two thumbs way down\" rating from Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott on the television show Ebert &amp; Roeper. Scott said that toward the end, the film was \"creepy, exploitive, and self-indulgent,\" a sentiment that was echoed in his review of the film for The New York Times.[20] Like Scott, Roeper had a strong negative opinion, saying, \"I hated this film,\" and \"I came very close to walking out of the screening room. And I never do that.\"[21] In the Chicago Reader, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum said the film was \"hallucinatory and extremely unpleasant\" and warned readers, \"Enter this diseased Lewis Carroll universe at your own risk.\"[22]\n\nThe Chicago Tribune critic Michael O'Sullivan,[23] however, praised the film,[24] further stating that \"... it's crazy, dangerous and sometimes gorgeous ...\",[25] and Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote, \"Tideland, for me, is a masterpiece\", a blurb featured on the DVD release.[26]\n\nFilmmaker David Cronenberg described the film as a \"poetic horror film\", a quote which was used in the advertising campaign for the theatrical release.[27]\nFilmmaker Rian Johnson named Tideland and The Fountain as his favorite films of 2006.[28]\n\nIn the 16 July 2007 online edition of Independent Film Channel News, Michael Atkinson published a comparative film review of Harry Kümel's rarely seen Malpertuis (1971) and Tideland. Atkinson posits that a historical perspective has made Kümel's previously scorned film a more viable creation when far removed from the cultural context in which it was first released. He goes on to argue that Tideland could be the 21st century counterpart to Malpertuis, suggesting that Gilliam's film \"is a snark-hunted freak just waiting for its historical moment, decades from now, when someone makes a case for it as a neglected masterpiece.\"[29]\n\n## Home media\n\nThe DVD of Tideland was released on 27 February 2007 in a 2-disc \"Collector's Edition\", with a commentary track, many interviews, deleted scenes (with a forced commentary over the original audio), and a making-of documentary entitled Getting Gilliam, made by Cube director Vincenzo Natali.\n\nThere has been some controversy among fans over the aspect ratio presented on the Region 1 DVD released by THINKFilm for the United States, which is 1.78:1, instead of the aspect ratio prepared and approved by Gilliam and the director of photography (in theaters, it was shown in 2.35:1, but Gilliam wanted to open up the image slightly for home video, somewhere between 2.10:1 and 2.25:1).[30]\n\nThere were early reports that DVD releases in Canada (Region 1) and other regions used the theatrical aspect ratio, but these have proven to be entirely false. The Region 3 DVD was rumored to feature the fully corrected transfer,[31] but this was later debunked on the same website where the claim was made; as shown in a purported screen capture of the Hong Kong release,[32] the Region 3 DVD uses the incorrect aspect ratio.\n\nThe UK (Region 2) release, does have a 2.10:1 aspect ratio.[33] The German EuroVideo–Concorde Home Entertainment release has been independently verified to use the theatrical 2.35:1 ratio, as is seen in screen captures from it.[34] OFDb.de also gives this ratio for the German release.[35]\n\nBoth THINKFilm and Gilliam have publicly stated that they are working on a solution to the ratio problem and will release a corrected version for sale as soon as possible.[33] That did not happen until the Blu-ray editions were released a decade later, long after THINKFilm had gone out of business.\n\n## Accolades\n\n- San Sebastian Festival (2005)\n    - FIPRESCI Prize\n\n- Golden Trailer Awards (2006)\n    - \"Most Original Foreign Trailer\".[36]\n- Saturn Award (2007)\n    - Best Performance by a Young Actor (Jodelle Ferland).\n- 27th Genie Awards (2007)\n    - Best Actress (Jodelle Ferland)\n    - Art Direction/Production Design (Jasna Stefanovic)[37]\n    - Cinematography (Nicola Pecorini)\n    - Costume design (Mario Davignon)[38][39]\n    - Editing (Lesley Walker)[40]\n    - Overall Sound.\n\n## See also\n\n- Works influenced by Alice in Wonderland\n- The Reflecting Skin\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Capri Films – Capri Releasing Archived 24 September 2007 at the Wayback Machine\n- ^ \"TIDELAND (15)\".

It is an adaptation of Mitch Cullin's novel of the same name. The film was shot in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and the surrounding area in late 2004. The world premiere was at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival where the film received a mixed response from both viewers and critics. After little interest from U.S. distributors, THINKFilm picked the film up for a U.S. release date in October 2006. Despite the film's eclectic and unconventional themes, which included child abuse, decomposition, incest, flatulence, mental illnesses and heroin usage, Tideland featured a number of notable actors, including Jennifer Tilly, Jeff Bridges, and Janet McTeer.\n\n## Plot\n\nJeliza-Rose has solitary adventures during one summer in rural Texas while staying at a rundown farmhouse called What Rocks. The girl creates an increasingly dark, imaginative fantasy life with the aid of dismembered Barbie doll heads that she often wears on her fingertips. With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape.\n\nAfter her mother overdoses on methadone, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Before they leave, however, Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid.\n\nDuring Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy (which Dell and Dickens did to their own dead mother). Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the \"Monster Shark\" he believes is roaming the countryside. The Monster Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside. It is also revealed that Dell and Noah were once \"kissers\", as Jeliza-Rose finds pictures of the two in the room Dell shares with her own taxidermied mother.\n\nAt the end of the film, following a violent confrontation between Dell, Dickens and Jeliza-Rose, a train wreck is caused by Dickens' dynamite, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse. Wandering about the wreckage, and among the confusion of injured travelers, Jeliza-Rose is discovered by a woman who survived, and she assumes the little girl is also a victim of the train wreck. The film ends with the woman embracing Jeliza-Rose, who stares with stunned confusion at the wreckage.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Jodelle Ferland as Jeliza-Rose\n- Brendan Fletcher as Dickens\n- Janet McTeer as Dell\n- Jennifer Tilly as Queen Gunhilda, Jeliza-Rose's mother\n- Jeff Bridges as Noah, Jeliza-Rose's father\n- Dylan Taylor as Patrick\n- Wendy Anderson as Woman / Squirrel\n- Sally Crooks as Dell's mother\n\n## Production\n\nTideland, despite being set in rural Texas, was filmed in the prairies of western Canada, with interiors shot in Saskatchewan. <Director>Terry Gilliam</Director> was enamoured by the original novel by Mitch Cullin, having discovered the book in a stack of unread books on his desk in 2001. He described the novel as \"funny, touching and disturbing all at the same time\".\n\nThe film's crew had initial trouble financing the film, but they were eventually able to get things in order. Rather than Jeliza-Rose narrating the story in first-person as in the novel, the screenplay was written in third person.\n\nQu'Appelle Valley served as the location for the decrepit house of Dell and Dickens, and also for Noah's old family home where he takes Jeliza-Rose. The harsh Canadian weather meant that the crew had to rush to finish the film before conditions became too difficult. Casting Jeliza-Rose was also difficult; roughly 400 Canadian girls auditioned for the role, none of whom Gilliam felt had \"a real soul\" for the character. A VHS tape from Vancouver was submitted that featured Jodelle Ferland, whom Gilliam agreed was perfect for the role. While acting in the Stephen King miniseries Kingdom Hospital, Ferland prepared for her upcoming role as Jeliza-Rose. Jennifer Tilly, who played Jeliza-Rose's morbidly obese, abusive mother, wore excess padding to make herself appear overweight, but for the most part the chosen cast merely relied on makeup and behavioural mannerisms to accentuate their characters.\n\nProduction designer Jasna Stefanovic, who worked on most of the aesthetics and sets for Tideland, took heavy inspiration from Andrew Wyeth paintings and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. While the film portrayed disturbing and grotesque scenes of taxidermy and a trapped live squirrel, no animals were actually harmed during the production.\n\n## Release\n\nTideland was released in theatres in 2006, but had first appeared in the autumn of 2005 at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival. The film was later released on DVD video in 2006–2007 in various countries, and a streaming version exists on Apple TV.\n\n## Critical reception\n\nAt Spain's 2005 San Sebastian Festival, Tideland was awarded the FIPRESCI Prize, selected by an international jury of critics who, in their award statement, said: \"Our jury focused on the international competition and found <Name>Terry Gilliam's Tideland</Name> to be the best film of the selection—a decision which provoked controversial reactions.\" \n\nIn response to the controversy surrounding the film's FIPRESCI win at San Sebastian, jurist Sergi Sanchez wrote: \"Gilliam's was the only one that dared to propose a risky and radical image, without any concessions, on a specific matter: madness as the only way of escaping in the face of a hostile environment. All this is endlessly coherent with the director's body of work, which has been frequently misunderstood by the critics, the industry, and audiences alike.\" \n\nThe subsequent mainstream reviews of Tideland were mixed, with Japan being the only country where it was both a critical and box office success. The film was first released in Russia (February 2006) followed by the Netherlands (March 2006) and Greece (May 2006). After almost a year without any US distribution, the film was picked up for American release by THINKFilm, and subsequently opened in the US, earning just $7,276 from one theater during its first week run. The film's release was then expanded, but to only nine theatres, for a total domestic gross of $66,453. Since then, several independent cinemas and art museums have presented the film as a special event, including IFC Center and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.\n\nGilliam has openly criticized THINKFilm for the manner in which the company handled the American theatrical release of the film, and their unauthorized tampering with the aspect ratio of the film for its US DVD release. He has also gone on record as saying that nearly all his films have initially garnered mixed reactions from critics, and in at least one interview, as well as in the introduction to Tideland, he has stated that he believes many moviegoers will hate Tideland, others will love it, and some just would not know what to think about it. Gilliam has also said that Michael Palin, another former member of Monty Python, had told him that the film was either the best thing he had ever done, or the worst—although Palin himself could not quite decide either way.\n\nEntertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave Tideland an \"F\", calling it \"gruesomely awful\". In the subsequent review of the DVD release, Gleiberman's fellow Entertainment Weekly critic Clark Collis gave the film a \"B\" and stated: \"Terry Gilliam's grim fairy tale is another fantastic(al) showcase for his visual talents.\"\n\nThe film received a \"two thumbs way down\" rating from Richard Roeper and guest critic A.O. Scott on the television show Ebert & Roeper. Scott said that toward the end, the film was \"creepy, exploitive, and self-indulgent,\" a sentiment that was echoed in his review of the film for The New York Times. Like Scott, Roeper had a strong negative opinion, saying, \"I hated this film,\" and \"I came very close to walking out of the screening room. And I never do that.\" In the Chicago Reader, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum said the film was \"hallucinatory and extremely unpleasant\" and warned readers, \"Enter this diseased Lewis Carroll universe at your own risk.\"\n\nThe Chicago Tribune critic Michael O'Sullivan, however, praised the film, further stating that \"... it's crazy, dangerous and sometimes gorgeous ...\", and Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote, \"Tideland, for me, is a masterpiece\", a blurb featured on the DVD release.\n\nFilmmaker David Cronenberg described the film as a \"poetic horror film\", a quote which was used in the advertising campaign for the theatrical release. Filmmaker Rian Johnson named Tideland and The Fountain as his favorite films of 2006.\n\nIn the 16 July 2007 online edition of Independent Film Channel News, Michael Atkinson published a comparative film review of Harry Kümel's rarely seen Malpertuis (1971) and Tideland. Atkinson posits that a historical perspective has made Kümel's previously scorned film a more viable creation when far removed from the cultural context in which it was first released. He goes on to argue that Tideland could be the 21st century counterpart to Malpertuis, suggesting that Gilliam's film \"is a snark-hunted freak just waiting for its historical moment, decades from now, when someone makes a case for it as a neglected masterpiece.\"\n\n## Home media\n\nThe DVD of Tideland was released on 27 February 2007 in a 2-disc \"Collector's Edition\", with a commentary track, many interviews, deleted scenes (with a forced commentary over the original audio), and a making-of documentary entitled Getting Gilliam, made by Cube director Vincenzo Natali.\n\nThere has been some controversy among fans over the aspect ratio presented on the Region 1 DVD released by THINKFilm for the United States, which is 1.78:1, instead of the aspect ratio prepared and approved by Gilliam and the director of photography (in theaters, it was shown in 2.35:1, but Gilliam wanted to open up the image slightly for home video, somewhere between 2.10:1 and 2.25:1).\n\nThere were early reports that DVD releases in Canada (Region 1) and other regions used the theatrical aspect ratio, but these have proven to be entirely false. The Region 3 DVD was rumored to feature the fully corrected transfer, but this was later debunked on the same website where the claim was made; as shown in a purported screen capture of the Hong Kong release, the Region 3 DVD uses the incorrect aspect ratio.\n\nThe UK (Region 2) release does have a 2.10:1 aspect ratio. The German EuroVideo–Concorde Home Entertainment release has been independently verified to use the theatrical 2.35:1 ratio, as is seen in screen captures from it. OFDb.de also gives this ratio for the German release.\n\nBoth THINKFilm and Gilliam have publicly stated that they are working on a solution to the ratio problem and will release a corrected version for sale as soon as possible. That did not happen until the Blu-ray editions were released a decade later, long after THINKFilm had gone out of business.\n\n## Accolades\n\n- San Sebastian Festival (2005)\n    - FIPRESCI Prize\n\n- Golden Trailer Awards (2006)\n    - \"Most Original Foreign Trailer\".\n- Saturn Award (2007)\n    - Best Performance by a Young Actor (Jodelle Ferland).\n- 27th Genie Awards (2007)\n    - Best Actress (Jodelle Ferland)\n    - Art Direction/Production Design (Jasna Stefanovic)\n    - Cinematography (Nicola Pecorini)\n    - Costume design (Mario Davignon)\n    - Editing (Lesley Walker)\n    - Overall Sound.\n\n## See also\n\n- Works influenced by Alice in Wonderland\n- The Reflecting Skin\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have inserted the relevant XML tags according to the attributes specified in the ADT while maintaining the original content and structure of the article.",

I get that the movie's themes and how it delivers them is quite...shocking, but it still felt quite accessible to me. The surrealism, the action, the cinematography was all top notch, and was visually compelling enough that I thought it would also attract more 'mainstream' audiences.

The film was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and was filmed as a found footage film and used a \"shaky camera\" technique. REC follows the night of a young reporter, Ángela Vidal, and her cameraman Pablo as they join a group of firemen during their night of work to an apartment building and end up quarantined there, with a terrifying virus spreading inside.\n\nAs the first installment of the REC series, it was followed by three sequels; REC 2 in 2009, REC 3: Genesis in 2012, and REC 4 in 2014 as the final installment in the franchise.[1] Spanish company Filmax International is responsible for the production of the REC franchise and released all four installments.[2][3]\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Storyline\n- 2 Cast\n- 3 Release\n- 4 Reception\n- 5 Continuity\n- 6 Notes and trivia\n- 7 Accolades\n- 8 References\n\n## Storyline[]\n\nA television reporter, Ángela Vidal (Manuela Velasco), and her cameraman Pablo, who cover the night shift in one of Barcelona's local fire stations for the fictional documentary television series While You're Sleeping. In the firehouse, the team meets Álex and Manu. While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman who is trapped in her apartment. When they arrive, Ángela and Pablo film the police breaking down the door. As they approach the old woman, she becomes aggressive and attacks one of the police officers, forcing the others to restrain her.\n\nMeanwhile, the building's residents gather in the lobby and look on as the police and military seal off the building. Álex, who remained in the old woman's apartment suddenly plummets through the stairwell to the lobby floor. Pablo, Manu and the second policeman go up again and are attacked, forcing the officer to shoot Mrs. Izquierdo. The camera crew remains trapped inside the building with the residents and continue recording. Ángela interviews a little girl named Jennifer who lives in the building. Jennifer is ill with what her mother, Mari Carmen, claims is tonsillitis. She says her dog, Max, is at the veterinarian because he appeared to be sick as well, and her father is out buying her needed medicine.\n\nSoon, a health inspector wearing a hazmat suit arrives and attempts to treat the injured, Álex an the older cop, who become aggressive and are locked inside the building's textile warehouse. The health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to rabies, and the time frame in which the disease takes effect varies by blood type. The health inspector also reveals that sometime during the previous day, a dog with the virus was taken to a local veterinarian; the dog became violent and attacked and killed other pets at the clinic. The dog was euthanized, and was traced back to the apartment building. Ángela suddenly realizes that the dog was Max and belonged to Jennifer, the sick child she interviewed earlier. The other residents surround Jennifer and her mother Mari Carmen, and are questioning them about the dog, when Jennifer suddenly vomits blood all over her mother's face, jumps out of her arms and runs upstairs.\n\nThe policeman handcuffs Mari Carmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with the firefighter Manu. They find Jennifer, and the officer tries to calmly subdue her with a syringe that the inspector gave him, but she bites him and he tells the others to leave him behind as he is now infected. Manu and Pablo run outside where they find that the infected are trying to break into the main hallway through the textile warehouse. They are forced to leave the handcuffed Mari Carmen, since the now-infected officer has the keys, and they run upstairs into an apartment. More and more people in the building become infected, and Ángela, Manu and Pablo are forced to fight them off. Eventually they learn that there is a key to a door in the apartment building workshop, which leads to an exit via the sewer system. However, the key is located on the fifth floor in the manager's apartment.\n\nAfter finding the key, Ángela and Pablo appear to be the only human survivors, everyone else being dead or infected. Rather than making their way to the workshop, they are forced upstairs to the penthouse by the remaining infected. They search the penthouse and discover that its owner was an agent of the Vatican who was charged with researching and isolating an enzyme believed to be the biological cause of demonic possession, which was later confirmed to exist in a Portuguese young girl named Tristana Medeiros.\n\nA door to the attic opens and Pablo uses his camera to look inside. An infected boy jumps at the camera and breaks its light. Pablo turns on the night vision and discovers the sealed door referred to by the agent on an audio tape. Tristana, now a blind and horribly emaciated figure, emerges and begins searching the penthouse, holding a hammer. Ángela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo trips and is viciously attacked by Tristana, causing him to drop the camera. Ángela picks it up and runs, only to fall and drop the camera as well. She searches for it in the dark but is unable to find it. The camera continues to record as Ángela is dragged into the darkness, screaming.\n\n## Cast[]\n\n- Manuela Velasco - Ángela Vidal\n- Ferrán Terraza - Manu\n- Jorge-Yaman Serrano - Young policeman\n- Pablo Rosso - Pablo\n- David Vert - Álex\n- Vicente Gil - Adult policemen\n- Martha Carbonell - Mrs. Izquierdo\n- Carlos Vicente - Guillem Marimón\n- María Teresa Ortega - Grandmother\n- Manuel Bronchud - Grandfather\n- Akemi Goto - Japanese woman\n- Chen Min Kao - Japanese man\n- María Lanau - Mari Carmen\n- Claudia Silva - Jennifer\n- Carlos Lasarte - César\n- Javier Botet - Tristana Medeiros\n- Ben Temple - Doctor\n- Ana Velasquez - Colombian girl\n- Daniel Trinh - Japanese boy\n- Marita Borrego - Operadoras Cuartel Bomberos\n- Jana Prats - Operadoras Cuartel Bomberos (as Ana Prats)\n- Víctor Massagué - Boy in the attic\n- Javier Coromina - Pablo\n\n## Release[]\n\nThe film premiered in August 2007 at the 64th Venice International Film Festival, out of competition, in the opening and closing films sessions.[4] It was also shown in October 2007 at the Sitges Film Festival[5] and the Málaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema in November 2007, before going on general release in Spain later that month.\n\nThe film was also shown in February 2008 at the Glasgow Film Festival and the co-directors participated in a corresponding interview in which they revealed their influences during the creation of the cinema work: \"Our main reference was TV; was not other films, or a tradition of previous features. I think the main influence for us was TV. What we wanted was to build a classic horror story, but, ahh, telling it in the way of a TV show.\"[6] REC was then released in the United Kingdom in April 2008 and a North American DVD release occurred in 2009.\n\n## Reception[]\n\nREC received widespread acclaim from most critics. As of July 30, 2012, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that, based on 23 reviews, the film has a nearly universal 96% approval rating.[7]\n\nReviewing the film for the BBC, Jamie Russell called it \"A runaway rollercoaster of a fright flick\", praising the \"faux-docu handheld style\", and the sense of claustrophobia and confusion, claiming that \"[Rec] will definitely jangle the nerves\"; however, Russell criticised the lack of substance and a \"one-dimensional\" supporting cast.[8] Bloody Disgusting awarded the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, with the reviewer writing, \"[REC] has it all and is probably one of the best Spanish horror films in recent memory.\"[9] Bloody Disgusting later ranked the film eleventh in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article stating: \"Out of all the “shaky-cam” films... this one is arguably the best.\"[10] In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.[11] Rec placed at number 54 on their top 100 list.[12]\n\n## Continuity[]\n\n- The news reports Ángela and Pablo find in the attic about the Medeiros girl are made clear in the sequel.\n- The curious teenagers get inside the building through the underground passage mentioned by César. It is revealed that it actually did not require keys, and he only needed to remember the passage a bit earlier.\n- Father Alberta fails to prevent the virus from escaping out of darkness, as revealed in Rec: Histórias Inéditas. How he managed to take the possessed Tristana upstairs without none of the residents noticing, as well as attracting the missing children there, remain unclear.\n- Jennifer's father appears in the sequel.\n- The fates of the Japanese couple's young son, his supposed ill grandfather and the elderly couple remain unknown.\n- Jennifer's infected dog Max causes a simultaneous outbreak that happens in the wedding party of Clara and Koldo, as his veterinarian uncle is bitten by the dog and infects their guests. A TV newsreport on the quaratined building is broadcasted there, but goes unoticed by Koldo.\n\n## Notes and trivia[]\n\n- Director Paco Plaza reportedly had chinese neighbors that never closed their door. This always intrigued him.[13]\n- The actors did not know Álex would fall to the ground floor. They are purposely sent back by the old cop moments before.\n- Ana Isabel Velasquez, who plays the Colombian girl, appeared as Clara and Koldo's guest Wendy in Genesis. Her scene, however, was deleted.\n- Pablo Rosso returns as the GEO cameraman Rosso in the sequel.\n- An alternate ending in which Ángela attempts to silently go down the staircase with the infrared, until she is finally devoured by the infected was shot but left out of the final cut.\n- Jennifer is featured in a teaser trailer being taken away from the building by a group of firemen.\n- With the exception of Álex and Manu, the men in the dinner scene are real all firemen.\n- Some of the considered titles were Orígen, 70 Minutos and Duracíon: 70 Minutos.\n- Due to the extremelly shaky camera moves, most of the infected make-up can not be seen on screen. A particular example is the young cop's ripped ear.\n- The Medeiros girl character was named after singer Glenn Medeiros.\n- Ángela and Pablo's show is reminiscent of the Argentine television programme La Liga. It has been adapted to Spanish audiences as 1 Equipo.\n- Up until the release of the sequel, both Balagueró and Plaza were unaware of a curious decorative sculpture on the top of the building depicting a monster grabbing a woman by her foot, which is strongly similar to the final scene of the film.[14]\n- The Japanese title for the American remake Quarantine is REC. The sequel Quarantine 2: Terminal is also titled REC 2.\n- Actor Javier Botet, who playes the Medeiros creature, appeared in the Guillermo Del Toro production as the title character in Mama. Guillermo Del Toro frequently casts Doug Jones, who portrays the creature in the American remake Quarantine, in his horror films.\n- The film ends with the building plagued by its infected occupants, making it seemingly impossible for Pablo and Ángela do descend. However, the infected remain mostly hidden in the sequels, and the characters are able to go up and down loosely for some time before they get attacked.\n- The building they used for Rec 1, 2, and 4 is a real building in Barcelona,\n- Most of the scenes were improvised, and the actors weren't given a completed script for the movie in order to show more genuine reactions instead of overacted scenes.\n- When the columbian woman attacks Angela, they almost crashed through a window.\n- Angela was played by real Spanish TV presenter Manuela Velasco, so that the role could be more naturally played.\n- The ending scene used real night vision, and was recorded in real darkness.\n\n## Accolades[]\n\n- Reaper Award 2009\n    - Won: Best Indie/Foreign production[15]\n- 2008 Goya Awards (22 edition)\n    - Won: Goya Best New Actress (Manuela Velasco), Goya Best Editing (David Gallart)\n    - Nomination: Goya Best Special Effects (David Ambid, Enric Masip and Álex Villagrasa)[16][17]\n- Fantasporto 2008\n    - Won: Grand Prix Fantasporto, Audience Jury Award[17][18]\n- Fantastic'Arts 2008\n    - Won: Special Jury Prize, Youth Jury Grand Prize, Audience Award[16][19]\n- Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival 2008\n    - Won: Silver Scream Award[17]\n- Cinema Writers Circle Awards, Spain 2008\n    - Nominated: CEC Award Best Editing, CEC Award Best New Artist[17]\n- European Film Awards 2008\n    - Nominated: Audience Award Best Film[17]\n- Fant-Asia Film Festival 2008\n    - 2nd place: Best European/North - South American Film Best Film, Fantasia Ground-Breaker Award Best Film[17]\n- Festival de Cine de Sitges 2007\n    - Won: Best Director Award, Best Actress Award (Manuela Velasco), Audience Award El Periódico de Catalunya - Best Motion Picture, Jose Luis Guarner Critic Award, Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver - Special Mention[17][20]\n\n## References[]\n\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite news\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/paco\\_plaza/status/524661741146615808\n- ↑ http://elpais.com/diario/2009/10/02/catalunya/1254445655\\_850215.html\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ 16.0 16.1 Template:Cite web\n- ↑ 17.0 17.1 17.2 17.3 17.4 17.5 17.6 Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n- ↑ Template:Cite web\n\nCommunity content is available under  unless otherwise noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n##\n\n### Explore properties\n\n- Fandom\n- Muthead\n- Fanatical\n\n### Follow Us\n\n### Overview\n\n- What is Fandom?\n- About\n- Careers\n- Press\n- Contact\n- Terms of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Digital Services Act\n- Global Sitemap\n- Local Sitemap\n\n### Community\n\n- Community Central\n- Support\n- Help\n\n### Advertise\n\n- Media Kit\n- Contact\n\n### Fandom Apps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRec Wiki is a FANDOM Movies Community.",

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nR/HORROR, known as Dreadit by our subscribers is the premier horror entertainment community on Reddit. For more than a decade /R/HORROR has been reddit.com's gateway to all things Horror: from movies &amp; TV, to books &amp; games.\n\n# The Wailing (2016): Comprehensive analysis and explanation\n\n-SPOILER WARNING-\n\nCurrently the most prevalent theory, and why it's wrong:\n\nThe most common theory on the internet is that the two shamans are bad and the girl in white is good.\n\nThere are a few details in the movie that suggest that the above conclusion is false:\n\n- The forest shaman, on the day after his interrupted ritual on the dead guy in the car, hurries to the car in an agitated manner. When he sees that the dead body isn't there, he is genuinely afraid and anxious.\n\nWhy would he be afraid in this manner if he had achieved his intended goal of resurrecting the corpse (assuming he's the antagonist)?\n\n2) When Jong-goo's deputy is telling Jong-goo and the deacon the story about how the shaman uses the photos to infect/possess the dead, he is very obviously (both to the audience and the characters) in a non-lucid state. It appears as though he is possessed when he is relating this story.\n\nIf the deputy is indeed a trustworthy character why does he kill his family like the rest of the possessed?\n\n3) If the invited city shaman, Il-Gwang, had evil intentions, why was he invited all the way from the city? Why did he want a large sum of money to perform the death hex if his motive was to hurt the family? Couldn't he just kill them and take their money?\n\nIt is not surprising that a lot of people fell for the wrong interpretation. The movie ingeniously tries to sway the audience and lead them to false conclusions just as the evil spirit deceives and misdirects the people of the village. In oriental superstition evil spirits are notorious for their deceptive ability. They always choose deception to coax their victims rather than using a straightforward approach.\n\nNow I'll go into an analysis of all of the important hints and events in the movie and what they mean. If you don't care about the hints and want to know exactly what happened in reality, then go to the end to see the summary of important events.\n\nThe Woman with the Trinkets\n\nThe woman in white seems to always wear or carry around trinkets. The trinkets and apparel she is wearing are from people who are possessed. Late in the movie you see her wearing the cardigan of an infected girl and you see on the ground near her there is Hyo-jin's hair clip.\n\nA far less obvious trinket is apparent when you see her for the first time in the movie. During our first encounter with her, she is wearing Park Chun-Bae's jacket. You see the jacket again later being worn by Park Chun-Bae when he is dead in the car. When the girl was wearing the jacket Park Chun-Bae was likely already possessed.\n\nAn Officer Possessed\n\nJong-goo's deputy, Oh Sung-bok, was the first to come up with the speculation that the rashes could not have been caused by mushrooms. He later does a complete 180 on this matter and starts dissuading Jong-goo from investigating the illness further. It is my opinion that Oh Sung-bok got possessed and this is what caused his 180. After his possession, all of the information that he provides is misinformation.\n\nThe possession took place on the night the two officers (Jong-goo and Oh Sung-bok) are visited by the naked possessed girl at the police station. The evil spirit attempted to posses both officers that night in their sleep, but it could not posses Jong-goo because Jong-goo was too pure or strong willed.\n\nThe morning after that night is the first time we see Jong-goo wake up in an agitated state, waking from a nightmare. In his sleep he says \"Stop goddam it!\", and he wakes up saying \"Stop it you dirty slut! You whore!\" This suggests to me that Jong-goo resisted his possession. Oh Sung-bok that same night was unable to resist possession leading to his 180 opinion change about the rashes and the forest shaman and also leading to his future misdirection.\n\nPossessed  Oh Sung-bok doesn't want Jong-goo to investigate the forest shaman because the forest shaman might reveal the truth about himself (forest shaman never does reveal the truth about himself because he believes that everyone has already made up their minds and the truth won't matter).\n\nThe Biggest Misdirection\n\nThe biggest misdirection that possessed Oh Sung-bok is part of is him leading everyone to believe that the forest shaman was using the photos in his hut to possess people. Look at how Oh Sung-bok behaves after seeing the photos and during the car trip back, when he claims the forest shaman to be a criminal. It is obvious that he is not speaking, but the evil spirit that possessed him is speaking. In the car Jong-goo even asks Oh Sung-bok \"What's wrong with you? Did you get bit?\" and says \"You're scaring me man. Snap out of it\", this is because Oh Sung-bok was behaving so oddly.\n\nThe True Motive of the Photos\n\nThe photos taken by the shamans are not used with malicious intent. Instead, they use the photos to perform rituals so that the dead cannot become possessed. The biggest clue for this comes when the Japanese forest shaman takes a photo of the dead Park Chun-Bae in his car. He surrounds the car with candles and takes the photo home to perform his ritual. The forest shaman's ritual is interrupted, and the next day we see the wounded forest shaman run to the car. He is visibly upset when he sees that Park Chun-Bae's dead body is not there. This confirms forest shaman's suspicion that his ritual failed and Park Chun-Bae dead body is possessed.\n\nThe protection of dead bodies against possession is a common theme in oriental superstition. You can see this theme in the movie Rigor Mortis (2013) as well. The rituals send away the souls from the bodies so that the souls cannot become possessed.\n\nPark Chun-Bae's body is the first dead body to be resurrected out of all the deaths in the village. This is because the previous dead bodies have had successful soul sending rituals done on them by the forest shaman.\n\nThe Possession of Hyo-jin\n\nHyo-jin is first contacted by the evil spirit on the night she delivers fresh clothes to her father at the police station. When she leaves the station she drops her hairclip. Jong-goo discovers the clip, but when he is about to pick it up he interrupts himself recalling the naked girl from the prior night. We never see him pick up the clip. This clip ends up in the hands of the woman in white.\n\nHyo-jin initially resists full possession. We see her recollecting a nightmare \"someone keeps banging on the door, trying to get in\". I believe that her resistance is facilitated by the forest shaman who uses her shoe to help in a resistance ritual. The next day, Jong-goo, deputy and deacon visit forest shaman. Possessed deputy Oh Sung-bok steals the shoe from forest shaman's place. When Jong-goo returns home with the shoe, we see that Hyo-jin is now fully possessed.\n\nIl-Gwang and the case of Mistaken Identity\n\nWe see that a shaman is invited from the city in order to help Hyo-jin. His name is Il-Gwang. During Il-Gwang's investigation of Hyo-jin, he inquires about someone Jong-goo met, someone he was not supposed to meet. Jong-goo mistakenly thinks that Il-Gwang is referring to forest shaman during this inquiry, but Il-Gwang was actually referring to the woman in white.\n\nDue to this case of mistaken identity, Il-Gwang mistakenly believes that forest shaman is the evil spirit. So, Il-Gwang attempts to kill forest shaman with his death hex.\n\nTwo Failed Rituals\n\nThe pain inflicted by the ongoing death hex causes forest shaman to stop his ritual to protect Park Chun-Bae's body against possession. Jong-goo interrupts Il-Gwang's death hex ritual, and as a result forest shaman has a chance to live another day.\n\nThe Death and Possession of Forest Shaman\n\nAfter forest shaman almost dies to the death hex and crawls into bed, you can see a brief glimpse of the woman in white ominously wandering outside. This is an important piece of allusion. The woman in white wants forest shaman to die so that she can possess him.\n\nThe next day when Jong-goo and gang chase forest shaman, you can see that forest shaman is obviously very distressed. If forest shaman were really a spirit, or a ghost, or a demon, he wouldn't be scared in this manner because people cannot kill ghosts.\n\nForest shaman is finally killed by the car and thrown off the ridge. There is no shaman around to take a picture of forest shaman's dead body and perform a final passage ritual, so forest shaman's body is free to become possessed. Indeed, the forest shaman that we see in the final act is the possessed dead body of forest shaman.\n\nThe Grand Final Meeting Between Deacon and the Possessed Dead Body of Forest Shaman\n\nFirst off all, the set-up for the meeting; why does the deacon decide to visit the forest shaman's home in the wilderness? The deacon is lying in a hospital bed with bandaged cheek and looking at the TV. The mushroom illness is spreading throughout the village and making people deranged, according to news reports. Next, the deacon visits Oh Sung-bok's house. Oh Sung-bok by now had already killed his family confirming that he had been possessed.\n\nThe look in the deacon's eyes as he looks at On Sung-bok is a call back to the look in his eyes much earlier in the movie. When On Sung-bok, Jong-goo and the deacon are leaving forest shaman's home by car after their first visit, you see several times the camera focuses on the deacon as he listens intently to possessed On Sung-bok's intricately weaved false narrative.\n\nIt is important to note that when On Sung-bok et al. are preparing to visit forest shaman for the first time we see him visibly wearing a cross. On Sung-bok is still wearing the cross when he is on the floor, after he has killed his family.\n\nWatching possessed On Sung-bok puts doubt into the mind of the young deacon. He must visit the house of the forest shaman not only to confirm his suspicion that the forest shaman is responsible for the continued possessions in the village, but also to reaffirm his faith. Under this light, the dialogue between the deacon and possessed forest shaman means a lot more.\n\nDeacon, desperate to reaffirm his own belief, asks the possessed forest shaman what his true form is.\n\nPossessed forest shaman responds, what do you think is my true form?\n\nDeacon says, the devil, you're the devil. - The word choice is important here. He said, \"You're the devil\", not I think you're the devil, not I believe you are the devil, not I suspect you are the devil. There is no doubt in his tone.\n\nDeacon then presses possessed forest shaman for a response, what is your true form? - Deacon must get confirmation about his beliefs.\n\nPossessed forest shaman says: \"You have already said it, I'm the devil.\" - \"Isn't that right? You are already certain I'm the devil. That's why you came here... carrying that sickle\" - \"My words, whatever I say, won't change your mind.\"\n\nDeacon refutes, \"No, that is not true.\" - he is more hesitant now, more doubtful about his belief.\n\nTo this possessed forest shaman responds: \"There is no doubt.\" - doubt here has a double meaning. There is no doubt that my claims are correct, there is no doubt in your mind about your own beliefs. \"You came here to confirm your suspicions about me. \" -  confirmation bias.\n\nNow, decon gets upset and emotional, he shouts \"No! If you say you are not the devil and reveal your true form to me - I'll leave you alone.\" - This is the first time that deacon challenges his own beliefs. This is the first time he allows the idea that forest shaman might not be the devil to enter into his mind. He could have questioned the false narrative prior to the death of the forest shaman, the forest shaman could have lived, but by the time he began questioning the false narrative it was already too late. Now, the forest shaman is dead and possessed.\n\nFurthermore, the proof that the deacon requires is a revelation of the true form. When forest shaman was human, he would have no way of proving that he was not the devil, because his true form was the human form. This line of reasoning has similarities to the Salem Witch trials.\n\nThe Mirrored Interrogation\n\nEarlier in the movie we saw deacon and Jong-goo are interrogating the real, unpossessed forest shaman. The interrogation then went in a similar vein to the deacon's solo interrogation in the cave, but Jong-goo had made up his mind much more steadfastly about the intentions of the forest shaman because he had fully adopted the false narrative.\n\nJong-goo asks forest shaman why he was there.\n\nTo this forest shaman hesitates and responds, \"To travel.\"\n\nJong-goo then says \"Tell him to confess, or I'll throw him in jail\", but deacon translates this to \"Tell us the truth.\"\n\nForest shaman responds: \"Even if I told you, you would not believe me.\"\n\nAfter this Jong-goo starts cursing, making threats and repeating the false narrative.\n\nJust as the possessed forest shaman claims in the cave, they had already made up their mind and were only looking for confirmation of their beliefs. Nothing he could have said would have swayed their mind, because they had already bought in to the deceit of the evil spirit.\n\nThe Liar, the Truthsayer and the Nihilist\n\nThe girl in white is the liar along with all she has possessed, including the deputy, Oh Sung-bok.\n\nIl-Gwang is the truthsayer. He has no incentive to lie. He has no ulterior motive besides money.\n\nThe forest shaman is the nihilist. He believes that the truth won't matter because nobody will believe him.\n\nAll of the above I have a low degree of uncertainty about. The following is something I'm unsure about as it requires a lot of assumptions:\n\nThe Girl's Trap\n\nThe girl in white, or the evil spirit, says that she has laid a trap for Il-Gwang and that all Jong-goo needs to do is wait for the trap to be triggered.\n\nThe evil spirit had a lot of incentive to kill Il-Gwang. Il-Gwang is the only shaman remaining who can take photos of the dead in order to perform the sending ritual, thereby making the dead impervious to possession and resurrection.\n\nWhen Il-Gwang was trying to escape the village by car, the evil spirit sent him visions so that he would return and get caught in her trap. How exactly the trap works is unclear, but it is clear that the flowers in the archway is the trap.\n\nYou will notice that when Il-Gwang first comes to town and goes to Jong-goo's house, he very carefully inspects the archway and the hanging bushes before entering through the archway. At the end of the movie when Il-Gwang enters the archway, he again hesitates before entering.\n\nIt is clear that Jong-goo triggers and breaks the trap when he enters to archway to find his murdered family. This is why the evil spirit is upset when she couldn't stop Jong-goo from leaving her to go back to his house. The trap was intended for Il-Gwang, but Jong-goo's triggering of the trap foiled her plans.\n\nThere are a few possibilities as to how the trap might work:\n\nCurrent best hypothesis about the trap: The flower trap is a ward against Il-Gwang. This is what stops him from passing the girl earlier and induces blood/regurgitation. Since he cannot pass, he cannot render assistance to the family. If Jong-goo passes the trap, the trap breaks; this is why Il-Gwang pleads with Jong-goo to go to the house.\n\nThe evil spirit/girl trying to keep Jong-goo with her has a dual purpose: 1) It stops Jong-goo from breaking the trap, 2) She is trying to keep Jong-goo with her in order to possess him. The possession requires time and requires that the victim is fully convinced/persuaded/deceived by the evil spirit. As she lies and convinces Jong-goo of her story, she draws closer and closer to Jong-goo and finally, at the later stages of her possession attempt, she is able to touch Jong-goo's hand. Jong-goo sees his daughter's hairpin and starts having doubts about her lies, this is when he is able to break free from the possession attempt.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1) If someone goes past the flowers, the flowers wither. The person who moves past the flowers become impure or a sinner, and thereby they are vulnerable to being interacted with/possessed by the evil spirit. Jong-goo had already sinned when he killed forest shaman, this is why the evil spirit could touch his hand. When Jong-goo passes the trap, it has no effect on him because he was already a sinner, but him passing triggers the trap and as a result it cannot be triggered again when Il-Gwang approaches the trap later.\n\nPossibility 2) We see very early in the movie during the investigation of the first murder scene, Jong-goo notices withered flowers at the pig farmer Hueng-guk's house. One room in the farm had a nest-like bed which we know is used in death hex rituals where a possessed person sleeps in the bed while the shaman attempts to perform a ritual to kill the perceived evil spirit.\n\nBased on the level of infection in the Hueng-guk's face, we know that the he had been possessed for some time. Cho, the ginseng farmer, was possibly a shaman who was called to exorcise Hueng-guk, but because Cho triggered the flower trap, the ritual backfired (we know from Il-Gwang's words earlier that the hex is prone to backfiring). The backfire caused Hueng-guk's possession to accelerate and as a result he kills Cho, and later his family.\n\nPossibility 3) The trap causes the possession to spread. The evil spirit wanted to infect Il-Gwang so that he could carry it out of the village and infect others beyond the village. She is upset when Jong-goo unintentionally ruins her plan by triggering the trap because all of the village is already almost dead and she has nobody else to infect/possess.\n\nPossibility 4) The evil spirit was lying about the trap to keep Jong-goo with her for longer so that she could possess him. The possession possibly takes some time to complete. If the rooster crowed 3 times then she would have enough time to possess him. Watch how she draws closer and closer to him and touches him near the end. She fails the possession when he sees his daughter's hair clip and he starts doubting her.\n\nPossibility 5) The flower in the archway helps the evil spirit create a barrier so that the shaman can't enter. This is why she is able to make him bleed/vomit earlier when he tries to pass. When Jong-goo passes the barrier, he breaks the protective barrier allowing the shaman to enter.\n\nSummary of important events:\n\n- Jong-goo and deputy go to investigate first murder.\n- That night they get visit from naked possessed lady. Later that night the evil spirit attempts to possess both of them in their sleep. Jong-goo's possession fails, but deputy gets possessed. Deputy will constantly lie and misdirect from now on.\n- On the night of investigation of second family death, Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin, comes to the police station to drop off clothes and on the way back she gets possessed.\n- Jong-goo meets and interacts with girl in white/evil spirit at the site of second family death. She lies about the forest shaman.\n- Hyo-jin starts showing signs of possession compelling Jong-goo to take action\n- Jong-goo, possessed deputy and a deacon go to visit forest shaman in the woods.\n- At shaman's house they discover a ritual room and a room with lots of photos/belongings.\n- On the way back to the village, possessed deputy lies and tells deacon and Jong-goo that the forest shaman was using the pictures to possess people. This is a lie. Infact, he was using them to perform protection and soul sending rituals so that the dead couldn't become possessed.\n- Hyo-jin's possession symptoms increase because the deputy recovered her shoe from forest shaman's house. Forest shaman was using the shoe to cast a protection ritual.\n- Jong-goo and deacon visit forest shaman again and interrogate him. Forest shaman says that they wouldn't believe the truth.\n- Second shaman, Il-Gwang, comes from the city. He asks Jong-goo about someone Jong-goo had met who he was not supposed to meet. Jong-goo mistakenly says the forest shaman; infact the person he was not supposed to meet was the girl in white.\n- Il-Gwang casts a death hex on forest shaman. Forest shaman is simultaneously casting a final passage ritual on the dead guy in the car, Park Chun-Bae. Both these rituals are interrupted. Forest Shaman does not die from the death hex and Park Chun-Bae's dead body is vulnerable to possession.\n- The next day, Jong-goo and gang visit forest shaman's house in the woods yet again. They chase and eventually kill forest shaman.\n- Il-Gwang sees the evil spirit, but she can't possess him. Instead, blood spurts out of his nose and he vomits. Il-Gwang attempts to escape the village, but the evil spirit won't let him leave.\n- The deacon sees the continued deaths in spite of the forest shaman's death and starts to have doubts. He visits the forest shaman to get some answers. Forest shaman is now possessed and he repeats what alive forest shaman said previously, the truth doesn't matter because nobody will believe him. Deacon vehemently disagrees, but now it's too late to ask for the real truth because forest shaman is already dead and possessed.\n- Jong-goo meets the evil spirit and gets a phone call from Il-Gwang. Il-Gwang tells the truth about the mistaken identity of the forest shaman and tells Jong-goo not to get tempted by the spirit. The evil spirit constantly lies and tries to keep Jong-goo with her. She has a dual motive for keeping him: 1) so that he doesn't trigger the flower trap that is meant for Il-Gwang (who will enter later) 2) (possibility) She needs time to possess Jong-goo and Jong-goo has to fully believe her before she can possess him.\n- Jong-goo leaves the evil spirit and triggers the flower trap. The evil spirit is upset because she couldn't accomplish either of her goals by failing to keep Jong-goo with her.\n- Il-Gwang comes to Jong-goo's house after everyone is dead. He can pass the archeway because the flower trap is dead, thanks to Jong-goo. He takes photos of the family so that he can cast soul passage ritual, so that the dead bodies don't become possessed.\n\nEdits:\n\n*made some revisions to the bold titles and added some more bold titles for clarity.\n\n*added some additional detail in the summary.\n\n*6/1 - Added current best hypothesis about the function of the trap and why the girl wants to keep Jong-goo with her.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of May 8, 2017\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of May 2017\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2017\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

For more than a decade, /R/HORROR has been reddit.com's gateway to all things Horror: from movies &amp; TV, to books &amp; games.</p>\n\n        <h1>The Wailing (2016): Comprehensive analysis and explanation</h1>\n        <p>-SPOILER WARNING-</p>\n\n        <p>Currently, the most prevalent theory, and why it's wrong:</p>\n        <p>The most common theory on the internet is that the two shamans are bad and the girl in white is good.</p>\n        <p>There are a few details in the movie that suggest that the above conclusion is false:</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The forest shaman, on the day after his interrupted ritual on the dead guy in the car, hurries to the car in an agitated manner. When he sees that the dead body isn't there, he is genuinely afraid and anxious.</li>\n            <li>When Jong-goo's deputy is telling Jong-goo and the deacon the story about how the shaman uses the photos to infect/possess the dead, he is very obviously (both to the audience and the characters) in a non-lucid state. It appears as though he is possessed when he is relating this story.</li>\n            <li>If the invited city shaman, Il-Gwang, had evil intentions, why was he invited all the way from the city? Why did he want a large sum of money to perform the death hex if his motive was to hurt the family? Couldn't he just kill them and take their money?</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>It is not surprising that a lot of people fell for the wrong interpretation. The movie ingeniously tries to sway the audience and lead them to false conclusions just as the evil spirit deceives and misdirects the people of the village. In oriental superstition, evil spirits are notorious for their deceptive ability. They always choose deception to coax their victims rather than using a straightforward approach.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Woman with the Trinkets</h2>\n        <p>The woman in white seems to always wear or carry around trinkets. The trinkets and apparel she is wearing are from people who are possessed. Late in the movie, you see her wearing the cardigan of an infected girl and you see on the ground near her there is Hyo-jin's hair clip.</p>\n        <p>A far less obvious trinket is apparent when you see her for the first time in the movie. During our first encounter with her, she is wearing Park Chun-Bae's jacket. You see the jacket again later being worn by Park Chun-Bae when he is dead in the car. When the girl was wearing the jacket, Park Chun-Bae was likely already possessed.</p>\n\n        <h2>An Officer Possessed</h2>\n        <p>Jong-goo's deputy, Oh Sung-bok, was the first to come up with the speculation that the rashes could not have been caused by mushrooms. He later does a complete 180 on this matter and starts dissuading Jong-goo from investigating the illness further. It is my opinion that Oh Sung-bok got possessed and this is what caused his 180. After his possession, all of the information that he provides is misinformation.</p>\n\n        <p>The possession took place on the night the two officers (Jong-goo and Oh Sung-bok) are visited by the naked possessed girl at the police station. The evil spirit attempted to possess both officers that night in their sleep, but it could not possess Jong-goo because Jong-goo was too pure or strong-willed.</p>\n\n        <p>The morning after that night is the first time we see Jong-goo wake up in an agitated state, waking from a nightmare. In his sleep, he says \"Stop goddam it!\", and he wakes up saying \"Stop it you dirty slut! You whore!\" This suggests to me that Jong-goo resisted his possession. Oh Sung-bok that same night was unable to resist possession leading to his 180 opinion change about the rashes and the forest shaman and also leading to his future misdirection.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Biggest Misdirection</h2>\n        <p>The biggest misdirection that possessed Oh Sung-bok is part of is him leading everyone to believe that the forest shaman was using the photos in his hut to possess people. Look at how Oh Sung-bok behaves after seeing the photos and during the car trip back, when he claims the forest shaman to be a criminal. It is obvious that he is not speaking, but the evil spirit that possessed him is speaking. In the car, Jong-goo even asks Oh Sung-bok \"What's wrong with you? Did you get bit?\" and says \"You're scaring me man. Snap out of it\", this is because Oh Sung-bok was behaving so oddly.</p>\n\n        <h2>The True Motive of the Photos</h2>\n        <p>The photos taken by the shamans are not used with malicious intent. Instead, they use the photos to perform rituals so that the dead cannot become possessed. The biggest clue for this comes when the Japanese forest shaman takes a photo of the dead Park Chun-Bae in his car. He surrounds the car with candles and takes the photo home to perform his ritual. The forest shaman's ritual is interrupted, and the next day we see the wounded forest shaman run to the car. He is visibly upset when he sees that Park Chun-Bae's dead body is not there. This confirms the forest shaman's suspicion that his ritual failed and Park Chun-Bae's dead body is possessed.</p>\n\n        <p>The protection of dead bodies against possession is a common theme in oriental superstition. You can see this theme in the movie Rigor Mortis (2013) as well. The rituals send away the souls from the bodies so that the souls cannot become possessed.</p>\n\n        <p>Park Chun-Bae's body is the first dead body to be resurrected out of all the deaths in the village. This is because the previous dead bodies have had successful soul sending rituals done on them by the forest shaman.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Possession of Hyo-jin</h2>\n        <p>Hyo-jin is first contacted by the evil spirit on the night she delivers fresh clothes to her father at the police station. When she leaves the station, she drops her hairclip. Jong-goo discovers the clip, but when he is about to pick it up, he interrupts himself recalling the naked girl from the prior night. We never see him pick up the clip. This clip ends up in the hands of the woman in white.</p>\n\n        <p>Hyo-jin initially resists full possession. We see her recollecting a nightmare \"someone keeps banging on the door, trying to get in\". I believe that her resistance is facilitated by the forest shaman who uses her shoe to help in a resistance ritual. The next day, Jong-goo, deputy, and deacon visit the forest shaman. Possessed deputy Oh Sung-bok steals the shoe from the forest shaman's place. When Jong-goo returns home with the shoe, we see that Hyo-jin is now fully possessed.</p>\n\n        <h2>Il-Gwang and the case of Mistaken Identity</h2>\n        <p>We see that a shaman is invited from the city in order to help Hyo-jin. His name is Il-Gwang. During Il-Gwang's investigation of Hyo-jin, he inquires about someone Jong-goo met, someone he was not supposed to meet. Jong-goo mistakenly thinks that Il-Gwang is referring to the forest shaman during this inquiry, but Il-Gwang was actually referring to the woman in white.</p>\n\n        <p>Due to this case of mistaken identity, Il-Gwang mistakenly believes that the forest shaman is the evil spirit. So, Il-Gwang attempts to kill the forest shaman with his death hex.</p>\n\n        <h2>Two Failed Rituals</h2>\n        <p>The pain inflicted by the ongoing death hex causes the forest shaman to stop his ritual to protect Park Chun-Bae's body against possession. Jong-goo interrupts Il-Gwang's death hex ritual, and as a result, the forest shaman has a chance to live another day.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Death and Possession of Forest Shaman</h2>\n        <p>After the forest shaman almost dies to the death hex and crawls into bed, you can see a brief glimpse of the woman in white ominously wandering outside. This is an important piece of allusion. The woman in white wants the forest shaman to die so that she can possess him.</p>\n\n        <p>The next day when Jong-goo and gang chase the forest shaman, you can see that the forest shaman is obviously very distressed. If the forest shaman were really a spirit, or a ghost, or a demon, he wouldn't be scared in this manner because people cannot kill ghosts.</p>\n\n        <p>The forest shaman is finally killed by the car and thrown off the ridge. There is no shaman around to take a picture of the forest shaman's dead body and perform a final passage ritual, so the forest shaman's body is free to become possessed. Indeed, the forest shaman that we see in the final act is the possessed dead body of the forest shaman.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Grand Final Meeting Between Deacon and the Possessed Dead Body of Forest Shaman</h2>\n        <p>First off all, the set-up for the meeting; why does the deacon decide to visit the forest shaman's home in the wilderness? The deacon is lying in a hospital bed with a bandaged cheek and looking at the TV. The mushroom illness is spreading throughout the village and making people deranged, according to news reports. Next, the deacon visits Oh Sung-bok's house. Oh Sung-bok by now had already killed his family confirming that he had been possessed.</p>\n\n        <p>The look in the deacon's eyes as he looks at On Sung-bok is a call back to the look in his eyes much earlier in the movie. When On Sung-bok, Jong-goo, and the deacon are leaving the forest shaman's home by car after their first visit, you see several times the camera focuses on the deacon as he listens intently to possessed On Sung-bok's intricately weaved false narrative.</p>\n\n        <p>It is important to note that when On Sung-bok et al. are preparing to visit the forest shaman for the first time, we see him visibly wearing a cross. On Sung-bok is still wearing the cross when he is on the floor, after he has killed his family.</p>\n\n        <p>Watching possessed On Sung-bok puts doubt into the mind of the young deacon. He must visit the house of the forest shaman not only to confirm his suspicion that the forest shaman is responsible for the continued possessions in the village, but also to reaffirm his faith. Under this light, the dialogue between the deacon and possessed forest shaman means a lot more.</p>\n\n        <p>Deacon, desperate to reaffirm his own belief, asks the possessed forest shaman what his true form is.</p>\n\n        <p>Possessed forest shaman responds, what do you think is my true form?</p>\n\n        <p>Deacon says, the devil, you're the devil. - The word choice is important here. He said, \"You're the devil\", not I think you're the devil, not I believe you are the devil, not I suspect you are the devil. There is no doubt in his tone.</p>\n\n        <p>Deacon then presses possessed forest shaman for a response, what is your true form? - Deacon must get confirmation about his beliefs.</p>\n\n        <p>Possessed forest shaman says: \"You have already said it, I'm the devil.\" - \"Isn't that right? You are already certain I'm the devil. That's why you came here... carrying that sickle\" - \"My words, whatever I say, won't change your mind.\"</p>\n\n        <p>Deacon refutes, \"No, that is not true.\" - he is more hesitant now, more doubtful about his belief.</p>\n\n        <p>To this possessed forest shaman responds: \"There is no doubt.\" - doubt here has a double meaning. There is no doubt that my claims are correct, there is no doubt in your mind about your own beliefs. \"You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.\" - confirmation bias.</p>\n\n        <p>Now, deacon gets upset and emotional, he shouts \"No! If you say you are not the devil and reveal your true form to me - I'll leave you alone.\" - This is the first time that deacon challenges his own beliefs. This is the first time he allows the idea that the forest shaman might not be the devil to enter into his mind. He could have questioned the false narrative prior to the death of the forest shaman, the forest shaman could have lived, but by the time he began questioning the false narrative it was already too late. Now, the forest shaman is dead and possessed.</p>\n\n        <p>Furthermore, the proof that the deacon requires is a revelation of the true form. When the forest shaman was human, he would have no way of proving that he was not the devil, because his true form was the human form. This line of reasoning has similarities to the Salem Witch trials.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Mirrored Interrogation</h2>\n        <p>Earlier in the movie, we saw deacon and Jong-goo interrogating the real, unpossessed forest shaman. The interrogation then went in a similar vein to the deacon's solo interrogation in the cave, but Jong-goo had made up his mind much more steadfastly about the intentions of the forest shaman because he had fully adopted the false narrative.</p>\n\n        <p>Jong-goo asks the forest shaman why he was there.</p>\n\n        <p>To this, the forest shaman hesitates and responds, \"To travel.\"</p>\n\n        <p>Jong-goo then says \"Tell him to confess, or I'll throw him in jail\", but deacon translates this to \"Tell us the truth.\"</p>\n\n        <p>Forest shaman responds: \"Even if I told you, you would not believe me.\"</p>\n\n        <p>After this, Jong-goo starts cursing, making threats and repeating the false narrative.</p>\n\n        <p>Just as the possessed forest shaman claims in the cave, they had already made up their mind and were only looking for confirmation of their beliefs. Nothing he could have said would have swayed their mind, because they had already bought into the deceit of the evil spirit.</p>\n\n        <h2>The Liar, the Truthsayer and the Nihilist</h2>\n        <p>The girl in white is the liar along with all she has possessed, including the deputy, Oh Sung-bok.</p>\n\n        <p>Il-Gwang is the truthsayer. He has no incentive to lie. He has no ulterior motive besides money.</p>\n\n        <p>The forest shaman is the nihilist. He believes that the truth won't matter because nobody will believe him.</p>\n\n        <p>All of the above I have a low degree of uncertainty about. The following is something I'm unsure about as it requires a lot of assumptions:</p>\n\n        <h2>The Girl's Trap</h2>\n        <p>The girl in white, or the evil spirit, says that she has laid a trap for Il-Gwang and that all Jong-goo needs to do is wait for the trap to be triggered.</p>\n\n        <p>The evil spirit had a lot of incentive to kill Il-Gwang. Il-Gwang is the only shaman remaining who can take photos of the dead in order to perform the sending ritual, thereby making the dead impervious to possession and resurrection.</p>\n\n        <p>When Il-Gwang was trying to escape the village by car, the evil spirit sent him visions so that he would return and get caught in her trap. How exactly the trap works is unclear, but it is clear that the flowers in the archway are the trap.</p>\n\n        <p>You will notice that when Il-Gwang first comes to town and goes to Jong-goo's house, he very carefully inspects the archway and the hanging bushes before entering through the archway. At the end of the movie when Il-Gwang enters the archway, he again hesitates before entering.</p>\n\n        <p>It is clear that Jong-goo triggers and breaks the trap when he enters the archway to find his murdered family. This is why the evil spirit is upset when she couldn't stop Jong-goo from leaving her to go back to his house. The trap was intended for Il-Gwang, but Jong-goo's triggering of the trap foiled her plans.</p>\n\n        <p>There are a few possibilities as to how the trap might work:</p>\n\n        <p>Current best hypothesis about the trap: The flower trap is a ward against Il-Gwang. This is what stops him from passing the girl earlier and induces blood/regurgitation. Since he cannot pass, he cannot render assistance to the family. If Jong-goo passes the trap, the trap breaks; this is why Il-Gwang pleads with Jong-goo to go to the house.</p>\n\n        <p>The evil spirit/girl trying to keep Jong-goo with her has a dual purpose: 1) It stops Jong-goo from breaking the trap, 2) She is trying to keep Jong-goo with her in order to possess him. The possession requires time and requires that the victim is fully convinced/persuaded/deceived by the evil spirit. As she lies and convinces Jong-goo of her story, she draws closer and closer to Jong-goo and finally, at the later stages of her possession attempt, she is able to touch Jong-goo's hand. Jong-goo sees his daughter's hairpin and starts having doubts about her lies, this is when he is able to break free from the possession attempt.</p>\n\n        <p>Other possibilities:</p>\n\n        <p>Possibility 1) If someone goes past the flowers, the flowers wither. The person who moves past the flowers becomes impure or a sinner, and thereby they are vulnerable to being interacted with/possessed by the evil spirit. Jong-goo had already sinned when he killed the forest shaman, this is why the evil spirit could touch his hand. When Jong-goo passes the trap, it has no effect on him because he was already a sinner, but him passing triggers the trap and as a result, it cannot be triggered again when Il-Gwang approaches the trap later.</p>\n\n        <p>Possibility 2) We see very early in the movie during the investigation of the first murder scene, Jong-goo notices withered flowers at the pig farmer Hueng-guk's house. One room in the farm had a nest-like bed which we know is used in death hex rituals where a possessed person sleeps in the bed while the shaman attempts to perform a ritual to kill the perceived evil spirit.</p>\n\n        <p>Based on the level of infection in Hueng-guk's face, we know that he had been possessed for some time. Cho, the ginseng farmer, was possibly a shaman who was called to exorcise Hueng-guk, but because Cho triggered the flower trap, the ritual backfired (we know from Il-Gwang's words earlier that the hex is prone to backfiring). The backfire caused Hueng-guk's possession to accelerate and as a result, he kills Cho, and later his family.</p>\n\n        <p>Possibility 3) The trap causes the possession to spread. The evil spirit wanted to infect Il-Gwang so that he could carry it out of the village and infect others beyond the village. She is upset when Jong-goo unintentionally ruins her plan by triggering the trap because all of the village is already almost dead and she has nobody else to infect/possess.</p>\n\n        <p>Possibility 4) The evil spirit was lying about the trap to keep Jong-goo with her for longer so that she could possess him. The possession possibly takes some time to complete. If the rooster crowed 3 times then she would have enough time to possess him. Watch how she draws closer and closer to him and touches him near the end. She fails the possession when he sees his daughter's hair clip and he starts doubting her.</p>\n\n        <p>Possibility 5) The flower in the archway helps the evil spirit create a barrier so that the shaman can't enter. This is why she is able to make him bleed/vomit earlier when he tries to pass. When Jong-goo passes the barrier, he breaks the protective barrier allowing the shaman to enter.</p>\n\n        <h2>Summary of important events:</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Jong-goo and deputy go to investigate the first murder.</li>\n            <li>That night they get a visit from a naked possessed lady. Later that night the evil spirit attempts to possess both of them in their sleep. Jong-goo's possession fails, but the deputy gets possessed. The deputy will constantly lie and misdirect from now on.</li>\n            <li>On the night of the investigation of the second family death, Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin, comes to the police station to drop off clothes and on the way back she gets possessed.</li>\n            <li>Jong-goo meets and interacts with the girl in white/evil spirit at the site of the second family death. She lies about the forest shaman.</li>\n            <li>Hyo-jin starts showing signs of possession compelling Jong-goo to take action.</li>\n            <li>Jong-goo, possessed deputy, and a deacon go to visit the forest shaman in the woods.</li>\n            <li>At the shaman's house, they discover a ritual room and a room with lots of photos/belongings.</li>\n            <li>On the way back to the village, the possessed deputy lies and tells the deacon and Jong-goo that the forest shaman was using the pictures to possess people. This is a lie. In fact, he was using them to perform protection and soul sending rituals so that the dead couldn't become possessed.</li>\n            <li>Hyo-jin's possession symptoms increase because the deputy recovered her shoe from the forest shaman's house. The forest shaman was using the shoe to cast a protection ritual.</li>\n            <li>Jong-goo and deacon visit the forest shaman again and interrogate him. The forest shaman says that they wouldn't believe the truth.</li>\n            <li>Second shaman, Il-Gwang, comes from the city. He asks Jong-goo about someone Jong-goo had met who he was not supposed to meet. Jong-goo mistakenly says the forest shaman; in fact, the person he was not supposed to meet was the girl in white.</li>\n            <li>Il-Gwang casts a death hex on the forest shaman. The forest shaman is simultaneously casting a final passage ritual on the dead guy in the car, Park Chun-Bae. Both these rituals are interrupted. The forest shaman does not die from the death hex and Park Chun-Bae's dead body is vulnerable to possession.</li>\n            <li>The next day, Jong-goo and gang visit the forest shaman's house in the woods yet again. They chase and eventually kill the forest shaman.</li>\n            <li>Il-Gwang sees the evil spirit, but she can't possess him. Instead, blood spurts out of his nose and he vomits. Il-Gwang attempts to escape the village, but the evil spirit won't let him leave.</li>\n            <li>The deacon sees the continued deaths in spite of the forest shaman's death and starts to have doubts. He visits the forest shaman to get some answers. The forest shaman is now possessed and he repeats what the alive forest shaman said previously, the truth doesn't matter because nobody will believe him. The deacon vehemently disagrees, but now it's too late to ask for the real truth because the forest shaman is already dead and possessed.</li>\n            <li>Jong-goo meets the evil spirit and gets a phone call from Il-Gwang. Il-Gwang tells the truth about the mistaken identity of the forest shaman and tells Jong-goo not to get tempted by the spirit. The evil spirit constantly lies and tries to keep Jong-goo with her. She has a dual motive for keeping him: 1) so that he doesn't trigger the flower trap that is meant for Il-Gwang (who will enter later) 2) (possibility) She needs time to possess Jong-goo and Jong-goo has to fully believe her before she can possess him.</li>\n            <li>Jong-goo leaves the evil spirit and triggers the flower trap. The evil spirit is upset because she couldn't accomplish either of her goals by failing to keep Jong-goo with her.</li>\n            <li>Il-Gwang comes to Jong-goo's house after everyone is dead. He can pass the archway because the flower trap is dead, thanks to Jong-goo. He takes photos of the family so that he can cast a soul passage ritual, so that the dead bodies don't become possessed.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </content>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while providing a structured and reader-friendly format, highlighting key terms and segments with XML tags as specified in the ADT.",

Noé is well-known for bending traditional cinematic rules to provide unique theatrical experiences, and this film is no exception. How does it rank among his best films?\n\nMy introduction to Gaspar Noé was a strange one to say the least. I was in college, my roommates and I were…ahem, not sober, and we decided to put on Enter the Void. Two hours later and I felt like I had seen something that had never been done before on film, and while my state of mind may have been compromised, that experience will always stick with me for showing me the possibilities of cinema beyond the mainstream. I was therefore excited for Climax, as the off-the-wall premise led me to believe this would be yet another exploration of themes, imagery, and ideas not yet seen on the silver screen.\n\nNoé has a knack for capturing the sensations and experience of drugs through the medium of film, which was one of the selling points of Enter the Void. However, that film lost tons of money and likely killed Noé’s chances of ever making something that ambitious and sprawling again. This film has the micro-est of microbudgets at under $3 million, and it shows. Singular location, short shoot (15 days), contained scope, zero special effects. And yet, this is an impressive feat in visual storytelling, managing to maintain visual appeal throughout despite a lack of extrasensory stimuli. We never get to see what our characters are hallucinating, only their bodily reactions, and that plus Noé’s clever camerawork keeps us engaged and on our toes throughout.\n\nNoé did not write a script for the film and mostly just let his actors ad-lib, which makes it a challenge to judge the film on a narrative level. But despite the naturalistic quasi-dialogue, there is an underlying structure to the film that is worth discussing. The film chooses to spend the first 30 minutes or so just getting us acquainted with each character. It’s a tedious sequence where not much is happening except characters talking to each other off the cuff. Then, once the acid trip begins, all exposition is done away with and we’re just along for the ride. Normally I would hate this compartmentalized approach to characterization, as I prefer action and character to develop simultaneously, but it actually works fairly well. Rather than watching a bunch of nameless/faceless people go crazy, we’re investing in each one of them and understand their motivations and fears as shit hits the fan. There’s an exception to every rule, and this is the one because I don’t think any other story structure would have served the film as well.\n\nThe choreography is phenomenal. The dance sequences are mesmerizing, aided by the fact that these are real professional dancers playing the roles. But besides the dancing, there are several impressive long takes that require serious coordination and timing. Sure, they probably cheated the takes a few times and I did notice a few subtle cuts, but it’s pulled off remarkably well. Again, a credit to the professional training of the dancers to hit their marks on cue. And despite the low budget, the practical effects are all believable – characters bleeding, on fire, or both, doesn’t matter. Nothing broke the immersion for me, and that’s a massive accomplishment on such a tiny budget.\n\nThematically, while the film is dense and obscure at times, it’s surprisingly straightforward and compelling by Noé’s standards. He explores the duality of dance as a collaborative art form yet an internal mode of expression, using it to reflect on human nature. While at the beginning our characters use their talents in tandem during the hypotizing opening dance, as the drugs take hold they regress into personal pleasures. They also turn on one another, growing more aggressive and violent as the night wears on, implying that only the constructs of society keep them from each other’s throats. Sexuality is heavily explored as well; most of our characters could be described as queer in some form, with varying levels of comfort in their desires for others. And most prominently, motherhood is considered…the prospect of bringing life into such a chaotic world. Noé is undoubtedly pessimistic about the future of humanity, as seen in all of his films really, but in Climax he offers a surprising glimmer of optimism and hope through the young mothers’ desperation to protect and nurture their kin.\n\nNot everything is seamless, of course. I found myself rather bored during the opening stages of the film, just kinda tapping my fingers and waiting for the trip to begin. Yes, as mentioned before, it was the only way to get the audience invested in the characters, but it wasn’t perfect and could have used more for our characters to do on-screen besides stand around and talk. The set they filmed on was incredibly small, with basically three rooms and a hallway between them; once we get the full scope of the space I didn’t really feel that I would see anything new after the first thirty minutes or so. They did what they could to make it feel lively, with light patterns and atypical camerawork to make us forget about the limitations, but they were still felt at times.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI liked what Climax was doing in theory more than in practice. It is one of the most impressive-looking low-budget movies I’ve ever seen, but could have really benefited from a little more money to fully realize Noé’s vision. I get that that is a near impossibility given how little money his films make, but that’s the state of experimental cinema in the 21st century I guess. The juxtaposition of action and character-building is rather jarring, and while I appreciate Noé trying something new to get the audience on board with our characters, it didn’t quite work for me. Still, given the ambition displayed within such tight constraints, I’m willing to overlook the film’s flaws and recommend it. But be warned: this is not for the squeamish or those uncomfortable with existential self-reflection.\n\n### VERDICT: B\n\nAll image rights belong to A24.\n\nThanks for reading!  I plan on checking out the other A24 release of the week, Gloria Bell, as soon as I get the chance. Also, check out my Letterboxd account for more mini-reviews and to follow along with my ongoing Best Films of 2019 list!

One woman, who had actually sat through the entire film, immediately walked out of the ensuing Q&amp;amp;A session past the stage, and hissed \"You are sick!\" at director Takashi Miike, much to his amusement and delight. At the Swiss premiere, someone passed out and needed emergency room attention.\n\n- Goofs(at around 1h) During their weekend getaway, Asami clearly removes all of her clothing then lies in bed and covers with a sheet. She then raises the sheet to expose the wounds on her thigh. The white panties can clearly be seen despite the fact that she just removed them.\n\n- QuotesAsami Yamazaki: Kiri kiri kiri kiri kiri kiri!\n\n- Alternate versionsAvailable in \"R\" and \"Unrated\" versions.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in The 100 Scariest Movie Moments: Part V: 13-1 (2004)\n\n- SoundtracksCarmen Suite #1 - Intermezzo\nComposed by Georges Bizet\nPlayed on a piano by Renji Ishibashi\n\n### User reviews526\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Creepy, Disturbing and Realistic\n\nIn Tokyo, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a widower that grieves the loss of his wife and raises his son Shigehiko Aoyama (Tetsu Sawaki) alone. Seven years later, the teenage Shigehiko asks why his middle-aged father does not remarry and Shigeharu meets his friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura), who is a film producer, and tells his intention. However, Shigeharu has difficulties to approach to available women to date and Yasuhisa decide to organize a sham audition for casting the lead actress for the fake movie. They receive several portfolios of candidates and Shigeharu becomes obsessed by the gorgeous Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina). Despite the advice of the experienced Yasuhisa, Shigeharu calls Asami to date and he falls for her. But who is the mysterious Asami? \n\n\"Ôdishon\" a.k.a. \"Audition\" is a great horror movie with a creepy, disturbing and even realistic story but with less violence, weirdness and gore than the usual, for a movie directed by the Japanese director Takashi Miike. The characters are very well developed and the beautiful Eihi Shiina is perfect in the role of Asami. The scene when she says \"deeper, deeper, deeper\" is scary and remains imprinted in the mind of the viewer. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Audição\" (\"Audition\")\n\nNote: On 21 March 2017, I saw this film again.\n\n- claudio\\_carvalho\n- May 30, 2014\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ20\n\n- How long is Audition?Powered by Alexa\n- What are the differences between the theatrical version and the unrated version?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - September 8, 2000 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - Japan\n    - South Korea\n- Language\n    - Japanese\n- Also known as\n    - Audición\n- Filming locations\n    - Tokyo, Japan\n- Production companies\n    - Basara Pictures\n    - Creators Company Connection\n    - Omega Project\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $131,296\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $362,963\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 55 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS-Stereo\n    - Dolby SR\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Audition (1999) in Brazil?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

                    "content": "An in-depth discussion of film\n\n# Found a cool Interpretation of Takeshi Miike's \"Audition\" (1999)\n\nIt's the last comment here: http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=127803\n\nI'll post it below so you don't have to click the link if you don't want to, just wanted to make it clear that's it's not written by me. Let me know what you think of it.\n\nWritten by YiBaiYuan:\n\n\" The Three Faces of Asami: i.e. it's all psychological Sorry about the lateness of this post. I didn't even hear about this movie when it first came out. I only discovered it recently, but boy am I glad I did. It's not just a good horror flick; it's got a deep meaning, once you find the key to access it. Besides reading the few posts here, I also read all 21 pages of reviews about it over at www.IMDB.com (Internet Movie Data Base). And while the majority of people enjoyed it, so to speak; very few of them even came close to understanding its message. So since no one else saw it this way, I may be way off base. But it makes perfect sense to me; so I'm glad to share it.\n\nSpoiler Warning: This isn't a review of the film for those who haven't seen it yet. It's an analysis of the film's psychological meanings for those who have seen it already. Spoilers ahead: You've been warned.\n\nThe film doesn't EVER show us the real Asami. Neither the submissive girl at the beginning, nor the psychotic fiend at the end is really her. All we are ever seeing is Aoyama's own perceptions of her in each phase of the relationship; perceptions which are not real but instead are colored by his desires and guilt and then projected onto Asami.\n\nIt helps in understanding the meaning of the film if you first understand the symbols used. Consuming Alcohol represents having a blurred view of reality: The two men are drinking when they discuss their skewed, old-fashioned views of how a woman should behave. Aoyama is drinking when he is reviewing the resumes; spilling directly on Asami's resume shows that his view of her specifically is unreliable. Also, he is usually drinking each time we see him thinking about her. Even just before the torture scene he is drinking, what we are to believe is a poisoned drink, showing that even that view of her is not accurate. Feet represent adultery or fornication through the metaphor of \"running around\". Removing the feet then represents preventing infidelity. A Tongue represents telling lies, usually; can also be just talking in general. An Ear represents listening to someone; a missing ear, then, is not hearing what they are saying. A Finger represents touching; typically physical or sexual abuse, but also may be intimacy.\n\nAs the film opens we see Aoyama completely lost in his emotions due to the death of his wife. It is only the appearance of his son that brings him back to stability. In effect, it is his relationship with his son that \"saves\" him emotionally.\n\nHe does not recognize that women have the same feelings that men have. This is indicated by the secretary who keeps announcing that she is leaving to get married, then waits for him to give a reaction that doesn't come. She's wanting him to be happy for her, because she has worked for him a long time and cares about what he thinks. But he has never noticed her other than as a worker that's there to do a job. Her feelings, if she has any, are insignificant. Likewise, in his discussion with his best friend about what kind of girl to choose, he likens it to picking out a car.\n\nAfter he has been widowed for seven years, it is at last his son who suggests that he enter another emotional relationship. Since his son was once his savior and remains the focus of his life, he has put his son on a pedestal and listens to his advice. Their relationship is not a traditional one where the son always defers to his father; instead, the father is submissive to the son, even though it should be the other way around. This is shown when the son tells the father to do the dishes and the father complies; when the son has a guest come over and the father gives up his dinner for the guest; and when the son enters the father's room without knocking.\n\nOnce he decides to look for a new wife and agrees to the ruse of an audition, he starts having feelings of guilt which begin to interfere with his desires; at first subtly, then more pronounced. He expresses several times that he feels like he is doing something wrong and even feels like he's committing a crime. He's not a bad man; he doesn't want to deceive anyone. He also can't bear the look of his deceased wife from her photo as he peruses the audition resumes. He still feels a sense of commitment to her, even though she's gone. His guilt is growing both from stepping out on his wife and from holding a sham audition.\n\nAlthough we never get to see the \"real Asami\", we can gather from the dialogue that she was as she said -- an aspiring ballerina who had an unhappy childhood and whose career was cut short by a tragic event. But Aoyama never sees the real Asami because he starts projecting onto her his image of the \"perfect partner\" from the very start. As he reads her resume, her story that her hopes were ended tragically and she now feels dead inside serves to elicit sympathy. As he remembers his own loss he makes her into a tragic heroine. He then falls in love with his created image of her as the \"perfect Asami\" without ever having met her and knowing nothing about her.\n\nWhen Asami comes into the audition room we cannot see the real her, we only see Aoyama's projection. His image of her is a sweet, shy, submissive, properly formal, \"good girl\". During the questions that his best friend Yasuhisa asks, we hear the real girl's answers, but Aoyama isn't paying any attention to them, he is only attentive to his projection. When he finally talks, he doesn't really ask her much; instead, he does most of the talking, telling her how wise she is for her age. Her only responses to him are, \"Yes\" and \"Thank you\". These were the real girl's responses. We can hear her throughout the film, we just can't see the real her. Every image is colored by Aoyama's psyche.\n\nEach time he calls her or even just thinks about calling her and we see her waiting by the telephone, we are not really seeing her in her apartment, we are seeing his imagination of her. As he calls her he is imagining that she is doing nothing but waiting by the phone for his call. When Aoyama begins thinking about meeting someone through the planned audition, even before the first resumes arrive, he \"sees\" a girl sitting in her room waiting for him; but at this point she is not yet defined enough to have features, those are put in place only after he sees Asami's photograph. This image of a submissive girl just sitting and waiting for him to summon her is merely another manifestation of his old-fashioned, male-dominant outlook.\n\nAfter dating a few times they go away for a weekend together. Although the weekend was his idea, once there he imagines that he is the stuttering innocent who doesn't have sex on his mind and that she is the one who initiates the sex. After their encounter he falls asleep and most of what follows is only a dream. He is dreaming from the time he kisses her till he wakes up and finds he still has his foot. He's awake just a few minutes before going to sleep again. He then dreams again till the end of the film. The story told in the dream state is choppy and jumps a bit.\n\nPrior to consummating their relationship, the real Asami admits to Aoyama that she was molested as a child. Previously she had only said she'd been injured, but now she wants him to know the truth before proceeding any further and for him to decide if he can accept it. She bares herself to him, figuratively, and reveals to him her scars; and he tells her it doesn't matter. When he had first heard of her abdominal injury he thought it was related to her dancing, so he felt sympathetic; but now that he hears it was a sexual encounter, he starts becoming disillusioned. His image of her begins changing to the opposite of goodness. Both her confession and his own act with her cause a change in his view of her from a perfect Asami to an \"evil Asami\".\n\nAlthough Asami is young and beautiful, she has not pursued finding a boyfriend because she knows that once men find out about her past they'll reject her. But she recognizes that it's hard for a girl to live alone. So she takes a chance that perhaps an older man might not be so picky, especially if he's getting a beautiful, young girl in return. She's also encouraged to take a chance with Aoyama since he's actively pursuing her. But she has guessed wrong: he is picky and wants a \"good girl\". She had tried to let him know early on by telling him her past in a coded way, by saying she'd been abused and had received an abdominal injury. But he was blinded by his projection of the perfect Asami and didn't comprehend what she was saying. His best friend, however, understood what she meant and so kept trying to dissuade him from the girl.\n\nAfter they have sex and Aoyama begins dreaming about her admission, he at first thinks about losing her. He even recalls his best friend's warnings to forget about her. But then he insists that, \"No\", he still wants her. However, as his subconscience takes over, he begins examining everything she's told him and the details start coming apart and recombining in a more negative picture. As he thinks of the sexual assault he suspects the dance teacher. The teacher's feet are prominent, symbolizing his debauchery; but they are deformed, showing that his sexual interests are perverted. Aoyama at first imagines an old lecher who has taken advantage of a small child; he crawled between her legs and left her scarred for life. But as he continues to consider this he begins to think that she may not have been so young and helpless after all when it happened. The dance teacher asks him if he has talked to her (tongue), heard her (ear), and touched her (finger). Next, as he thinks of her employer, the imagined dialogue with the fellow employee makes that whole story \"go to pieces\". As he considers everything she's told him there are too many parts, and some of them don't fit together into a proper whole; there are details left over, figuratively. The scene culminates in the image of the severed tongue flapping around, which for him signifies lying. He comes to think that everything she has said has been lies and deceptions.\n\nThe missing record producer and missing bar madam are two of the pieces he can't make fit. These were just facts thrown into the story to allow for misdirection. We're supposed to think that it's the record producer in the sack and that the bar madam was murdered and dismembered. But actually it's just coincidence that the record producer left town and only because of insufficient detail that he can't find where Asami worked. Aoyama's best friend only says he can't track down the record producer and the bar madam; that doesn't mean anything has happened to them, it's only a lack of information. But his imagination turns these things into pieces that don't fit her story; so she must be evil and lying. The extra pieces of the dismembered body are described as three fingers, an ear, and a tongue (remember those?). That there are \"three\" fingers is a product of him imagining that she was touched by three people -- her Uncle; her Stepfather; and either her Aunt if we're considering any abuse, or her record producer if it only refers to sexual abuse. Personally I think it refers to the Aunt, and that the record producer had very little involvement with her before leaving town for unknown reasons.\n\nHe is also led to question just what it is he is looking for in a woman. A succession of images of different girls attacking him sexually -- an aggressive Asami, his secretary, and even his son's young girlfriend -- all serve to expose to him his conflicting ideas of women's purity, innocence, and sexuality.\n\nHis changed image of Asami is again indicated by his consumption of alcohol, in what we think is a poisoned drink. His picture of her has now been poisoned and takes a very dark turn as he begins to imagine the evil Asami torturing him and destroying every part of his life little by little. He is experiencing the pain that emotional attachment can bring: loss of freedom, visceral torment, and submission to another's will. Evil Asami is both the manifestation of his disillusionment with Asami who is now seen as not perfect, and the embodiment of his own guilty conscience which is punishing him for lying and running around, and his attitude towards women.\n\nHe comes back to reality momentarily when he wakes up with a start, finds he's still in bed with her, and to his relief still has his foot. He realizes that his perception of her has changed, but before he can figure out what to do she announces that she will accept his marriage proposal. He now feels trapped in a relationship with someone whom he no longer feels to be a perfect partner. So he goes back to sleep and dreams again, trying to find a resolution to his problem.\n\nPrior to their weekend together he had always pictured her in dazzling white clothes and with a submissive demeanor, symbolizing her purity and goodness. But after he slept with her and after her admission, he could no longer consider her \"pure\". So he began picturing her in black leather and with a very dominant personality; the very opposite of what he considered a \"good girl\". He still didn't see the real her; but now instead of projecting on her an image of goodness, he began projecting on her an image of wickedness. His imagination put pictures to all of the negative metaphors of his guilty conscience -- telling lies (cut off tongue), tasting pain (syringe), feeling it in his stomach (needles), a playboy that \"runs around\" (cut off feet), searching for beauty and youth (eyes), losing his head, and so on. When the negative images first start making themselves felt, he tries to run and escape; but he is literally tripped up by the sack on the floor. He finally opens it to see what it is and is shocked by what's inside.\n\nThe sack represents his own emotional feelings toward Asami. It first appears when he considers calling her for a second date. Initially he is able to keep his emotions under tight control; completely bagged up, so to speak. But as he becomes more interested in this girl, his emotions wake up and start working to get out. When he calls her and the phone rings too long, he imagines she's deliberately waiting and his emotions jerk; but then she answers and the sack lies still. Each time his emotions grow we see the bag move. Later when he finally opens the bag and releases it we see a tortured man who has been stripped of almost all his humanity, completely enslaved to the whims of this woman no matter how sadistic and evil she may be. He cannot tell lies, or run around, or touch other women. In other words he is emasculated.\n\nHe is totally trapped by his emotions and powerless to free himself from this girl, despite projecting onto her a facade of great evil. Although he is now completely disenchanted about her purity, he is already ensnared by his emotional attachment to her. He will do anything she wants, even to the point of being treated like a dog and lapping up her regurgitated lies while she pats him on the head like a pet.\n\nOnly after he's realized this do his thoughts turn to his son. His son saved him from emotional helplessness once before, perhaps he can do it again. As Aoyama concentrates on his son, he appears. At first it seems the evil Asami may destroy him too; but their encounter is interrupted by Aoyama waking up briefly. When the dream begins again, Shigehiko and Asami battle it out in Aoyama's head to see which will prevail. At last Aoyama finds his love for Shigehiko is stronger than his attachment to Asami, thus he is able to break free of her domination.\n\nHe had become completely enamored of this girl despite his assertions early on that he was mature enough and smart enough not to be taken in by emotions. But as things progressed, neither his love for his pet, nor his love for his best friend, nor even his love for his dead wife were enough to prevent him from getting ensnared once he had decided to have an emotional relationship again. He had been lonely too long. Only his love for his son was strong enough to free him from his false projections and help him become emotionally stable again.\n\nOnce he had killed the image of the evil Asami he was able to hear for the third time the conversation from their second date. The first time he heard it, it was colored by his perfect image of her, and her family was rich and happy; the second time he heard it, it was colored by his evil image of her, and her family was abusive and hateful; but the third time, he actually heard the real her. And he comes to realize that there is a real person behind his projected images; someone with real feelings, someone just as vulnerable as he. As they had prepared to sleep together, her request that he \"love only her\" was seen by him as her attempt to assert control over him, and his mind rebelled against that. In actuality it was just a plea for him not to hurt her. Finally, once he got a grip on his emotional state, he heard their conversation one more time. In the third version he finally comes to understand the meaning of their relationship -- we take a chance, and we suffer a lot, but we survive. They both had taken a chance on the relationship, and both had exposed themselves to potential suffering at the hands of the other, but if they respected each other they could survive.\n\nAll the time that he's having the second dream, he is still with her in bed on their weekend trip. But the film doesn't show him awakening from the dream and doesn't tell us how he will resolve this in his waking life. Will he go ahead and marry her, or will he dump her? How he will now handle the real Asami isn't told. The story is about how Aoyama's \"projected views\" of Asami changed as their relationship progressed and how his feelings of guilt were made manifest then resolved. He goes from seeing women (Asami) as objects meant only to serve men submissively, to seeing that they are also people with their own needs and feelings; and those needs are similar to his own -- the desire for companionship, love, and respect."

But when was the last time you described a horror movie as “joyous?” Watching One Cut of the Dead is a joyous experience, one that will make you hit play as soon as the final credits are over so you can watch it again.\n\nWritten, directed, and edited by Shinichiro Ueda, starts out as a zombie movie, and a pretty bad zombie movie at that. The actors look confused, the props and effects look cheap and the whole thing is shot in a shaky handheld camera style that makes The Blair Witch Project look like it was filmed on a movie set with a steady cam. It’s a bad movie, albeit oddly compelling to watch. You mind switches back and forth from what will happen next to how did this get released in the first place. After about half an hour, even the most forgiving of genre fans will be tempted to switch it off and chalk it up as just another low budget failure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBut don’t stop it. You won’t know it until the end, but the first 37 minutes of One Cut of the Dead are setting you up for an entirely different movie, one that not only delightfully answers all the questions building up in your brain during the first third, but that treats you to an insiders look at how this, and just about every horror movie you can think of, got made.\n\nAs for details about what happens in One Cut of the Dead, the best we can offer is a reprint of the official synopsis:\n\nWhile shooting a low-budget zombie film in an abandoned warehouse, the crew finds themselves caught between actual zombies and a mad director who won’t stop rolling. If you think you know what happens next, think again. Filmmaker Shinichiro Ueda turns the film on its head more than once for one of the wildest, funniest, and most surprising zombie movies of all time.\n\nThe cast of One Cut of the Dead does a fabulous job giving us several seemingly disparate characters who eventually all fit snugly together into one complete picture. Takayuki Hamatsu is particularly delightful as Director Higurashi, the ‘average’ man put in charge of creating the flagship live television show for a new zombie television network. Harumi Shuhama is also good as the director’s wife, a woman so bored with domestic life that she tries and abandons hobbies the way most other people change socks. In fact, the entire cast of One Cut of the Dead are spectacular and the best part is that while you may come to love — or hate — one of the characters in those first 37 minutes, the rest of the film will give you plenty of chances to reassess your opinions of those characters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd that’s another great reason to push play at the end of the movie — and only at the very end after all the credits are over — the screen goes completely black. There’s something magical — and, yes, joyous — about the way One Cut of the Dead celebrates the passion of the people who make films that underscores the passion of the people who watch them. For genre fans, it’s like suddenly waking up in a world where you no longer have to defend your love of all things horror.\n\nAnd so you can go back and watch those first 37 minutes with new eyes and fresh insights as you head fills with questions, not about what happens next (because you know not only what, but how and why) but about why there aren’t more movies as good as One Cut of the Dead being made and released today.\n\n- John Black, One Cut of the Dead\n\n### Help spread the word, share this Gruesome content:\n\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- Pinterest\n- Tumblr\n- LinkedIn\n- Reddit\n- More\n\n- Pocket\n- Telegram\n- WhatsApp\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Black still remembers his first horror movie, sneaking in to a double-feature of Horror House with Frankie Avalon and a Boris Karloff film he canâ€™t remember the name of but will always remember for giving him his first glimpse of cinematic nudity as one of the actresses moved from the bed to the door without putting on any underwear! (Fond family memory: That glimpse, when discovered by his parents, cased Johnâ€™s mom to call the theater and yelling at the manager for letting her son see â€˜such filthâ€™.) Luckily, John was more impressed by the blood and horror than the bare haunches and quickly became a devotee of the genre. \n \n John has been a professional movie reviewer since 1987, when his first review â€“ of a Robert De Niro film called Angel Heart â€“ appeared in the entertainment section of The Cape Codder newspaper. Heâ€™s been writing about film ever since, primarily now as the entertainment editor at Boston Event Guide. Hardly a day goes by when he doesnâ€™t watch at least one movie, which is how he thinks life was meant to be.\n\n## Post navigation\n\n## Related News\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## [Review] Growing Old Is Terrifying If You Follow THE RULE OF JENNY PEN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## [Review] Evil Finds A New Way To Haunt You In BLOAT (2025)\n\n## Scarred for Life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MOVIES AND BOOKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PATREON EXCLUSIVES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gruesome Newsletter\n\n## Slasher App\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook for Gruesome Magazine on the Slasher App!\n\n## Classic Sci-Fi Movie Channel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDigital Newspaper - Multipurpose News WordPress Theme 2025.\t\t\t\tPowered By .",

Everyone must have really taken their vitamins and eaten their vegetables the year before, because WOW that is a strong set of films for one year. Two Sisters, from I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad the Weird director Kim Jee-woon, is a masterful exercise in building tension to create a true sense of horror.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd I say horror because boy, this movie was scary. I can always tell when something is effectively frightening me, because I frequently turn the sound down to almost mute, and only watch one corner of the screen, to avoid the full shock of anything nasty that I expect to jump out at me at any moment. Two Sisters? At least 50% of it was watched from behind the ear of my giant Koya plushy (it’s a BTS thing, the face of a sleepy koala, google it), with pretty much no sound. I will freely admit that there’s every chance I missed some great dialogue due to cowering, but the power of this film luckily managed to override that.\n\nIn YouTube channel Spikima’s great video on the topic, they explain how this film uses various technical elements (colour palette, set design, lighting etc) to create a whole experience that is frightening, rather than simply one shot or one scene. It’s a great analysis, because this is definitely a film that is entirely rather than partially unsettling. There is no scene where we can fully break from the sense of the eerie that this film starts with, and no moment that feels safe. This is the most amazing feat of A Tale of Two Sisters.\n\nI mentioned in my beginning that the literal Korean translation of this title is Rose Flower, Red Lotus (장화, 홍련) because this story actually has its origins in an ancient traditional Korean tale from the Joseon era. Even if you’ve literally never heard the word ‘Joseon’ before, this context can let you know that this story has the air of the mythic or fairy-tale about it. The film itself concerns a young girl, Su-mi, who has recently been released from a mental institution due to some unspecified traumatic incident (I wonder if we’ll find out what it was), to return to the isolated country home of her father and new stepmother, alongside her vulnerable younger sister Su-yeon. Both girls (as well as the audience) are mistrustful of the strange, spiky stepmother Eun-joo, whose behaviour only becomes more and more strange as the movie continues. Not long into the film we are plunged into the first night, full of mysterious noises, figures skulking in corridors, and general shady business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is a story of haunted houses, ghosts, and an evil woman usurping the place of a venerated but lost mother. As I said, total fairy-tale territory. The notions of hauntings and ghosts stand in fairly obviously for symbols of trauma and violent histories that have not been fully comprehended. So to does the stepmother figure often represent a dangerous, evil warping of the family unit, an undoing of the saintly role of motherhood with more wicked and base aims. Not really a fair representation in like, any way, but we’re talking about ancient myths here. Being understanding hadn’t been invented yet.\n\nIn the myth that this film was based on, the two virtuous daughters of a king with an evil second wife both end up dead, one as a result of trickery on the stepmother’s part, seeing her stepdaughter as a threat to her own son’s chances at power. These daughters become vengeful ghosts, seeking the unveiling of the truth that led to their demise. Again, symbolism of unresolved trauma much? It’s all here in the source material.\n\nWhilst Two Sisters is by no means a direct retelling of this story, there are nods and echoes aplenty. The sisters in the folk tale drown in a pond: there is a delightful little lake that the sisters bathe their feet in at the start of the film. Dead animal carcasses feature in the undoing of the virtuous princess (again, please google it, its gross and I don’t want to explain): we see the remains of a fish and an ex-budgie in this movie. The stepmother of the fairy tale is cruel and self-serving: whilst it could be debated whether Eun-joo in this movie is really working for herself, or else has other issues she (or perhaps someone else) needs to deal with, she is undoubtedly unkind and occasionally sadistic to her stepdaughters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll of these elements lend a sense of the otherworldly to this claustrophobic tale, told almost entirely inside a huge, corridor-ridden house seemingly in the middle of nowhere. It reminded me of 2020’s The Call, a maze of rooms and hallways that only offer foreboding in their shadowiness. As Spikima points out, the contrast of vivid colours with earthy tones indicate the contrast between different perceptions of reality, with an additional ingenious use of patterns, mirrors, and repeated actions to suggest a sense of doubling, and a maddening one at that. I don’t feel it would be fair to totally reveal the hand that this film is playing in this regard (though to be fair I’ve gone pretty far already, soz), but these visual motifs are cleverly woven into the very fabric of the film to indicate its core plot points before we ever discover them.\n\nThe fear in this film comes from the expert application of all these ideas, along with a sense of patience that is lacking from lesser ‘scary’ films. My favourite film critic, horror aficionado Mark Kermode (hello to Jason Isaacs), describes these lazy attempts at horror as ‘quiet quiet bang’ movies, relying on the simple knee-jerk response of jumping at a loud noise to create tension, rather than like, you know, skill. During Two Sisters, I was constantly on edge, waiting for the moment that the quiet lulls would suddenly pivot to a violent image, a loud noise, a gruesome moment. When the lights went out, I was waiting for the ghoulish faces jumping from corners.\n\nAnd this is not to say that there are no sudden jump cuts in this movie, no stomach-drop ‘what the ever-loving fuck is behind her’ shots. The scene where the aunt recounts what she saw under the sink whilst having a fit at the dinner party (it’s a horror movie, just accept the scenario and move on), is probably the most instantly frightening of the whole film. But this film, like the best of them, knows what you expect, and drags the terror out in much smarter ways.\n\nTake, for example, the scene I personally found most disturbing. Like Halloween, this scene imaginatively takes place in broad daylight, here even going as far as taking place in the early morning. The horror convention of ‘it’s light, so nothing bad can happen’ is truly subverted as Su-mi, waking up drowsily, sees a dark figure at the foot of her bed, who proceeds to hover ever closer over her, eventually appearing as her mother, white face, stringy black hair and blood all included. Whilst this is ultimately a dream, it is entirely terrifying in refusing to rely on sound or darkness for fear. Instead we are simply faced with the unnerving, gradually getting closer and closer to us in a suffocating way that we can’t escape.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClose-ups and panning shots are very much the bread and butter that make this movie so full-on. So many scenes centre around shots entirely taken up with a character’s face, displaying their fear and confusion about the strange goings on around them. We also get a lot of shots beginning in this way that swing around to reveal what is behind, or around, and whilst not always revealing something specific, add a very theatrical sense of suspense to quite simple moments in the narrative.\n\nUltimately, that’s what A Tale of Two Sisters is. A theatrical ghost story, playing on our expectations and emotions to create a truly edge-of-the-seat experience. Of course, I could go in to more critical detail of the representation of female mental illness in this film- let’s just say I’m going to guess this isn’t a fully accurate depiction of psychosis, trauma response, or the other major illness depicted in the film- but that is honestly outside my place to comment on knowledgeably. I would say that this film is a fantastically inventive re-working of a traditional fairy-tale, upping the horror elements in the most skilled way without ever relying on laziness or cheap tricks. This film is genuinely a very frightening watch, so do be warned, but A Tale of Two Sisters has a rightful place in the pantheon of East Asian horror classics.\n\n- movies\n- film\n- south korea\n- kim jee-woon\n- a tale of two sisters\n\n- Sarah Knows Nothing About Movies\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSarah Knows Nothing About Movies- The Call Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt’s Cinema September!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCinema September 7: I Saw The Devil\n\nSubscribe Form\n\n©2020 by Sarah Knows Nothing.

We also get a lot of shots beginning in this way that swing around to reveal what is behind, or around, and whilst not always revealing something specific, add a very theatrical sense of suspense to quite simple moments in the narrative.\n\nUltimately, that’s what <Name>A Tale of Two Sisters</Name> is. A theatrical ghost story, playing on our expectations and emotions to create a truly edge-of-the-seat experience. Of course, I could go in to more critical detail of the representation of female mental illness in this film- let’s just say I’m going to guess this isn’t a fully accurate depiction of psychosis, trauma response, or the other major illness depicted in the film- but that is honestly outside my place to comment on knowledgeably. I would say that this film is a fantastically inventive re-working of a traditional fairy-tale, upping the horror elements in the most skilled way without ever relying on laziness or cheap tricks. This film is genuinely a very frightening watch, so do be warned, but <Name>A Tale of Two Sisters</Name> has a rightful place in the pantheon of East Asian horror classics.\n\n- movies\n- film\n- south korea\n- <Director>kim jee-woon</Director>\n- <Name>a tale of two sisters</Name>\n\n- Sarah Knows Nothing About Movies\n\n## Recent Posts\n\nSarah Knows Nothing About Movies- The Call Review\n\nIt’s Cinema September!\n\nCinema September 7: I Saw The Devil\n\nSubscribe Form\n\n©2020 by Sarah Knows Nothing.

Jen is a young, beautiful American who wants to move to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams and believes Richard can help her. She seduces him, and afterwards, he calls his wife to check in. The next morning, Richard's friends Stan and Dimitri arrive early to take part in a hunting trip. Richard is forced to introduce Jen to them as he planned for her to leave before they arrived. That night, the four of them party. Jen asks to take the peyote but Richard declines, citing an anecdote he heard about a man who took peyote and sawed off his own leg without feeling it. Inebriated, Jen dances a sexy routine. When an exhausted Richard declines to join her, she dances seductively with Stan instead. Jen awakes to Richard being away for the morning. Stan becomes aggressive when she rebuffs his advances, and eventually rapes her. Dimitri sees the rape but ignores it. Richard returns and berates Stan, but when Jen asks to go home, he insists that she move to Canada on his dime. When Jen threatens to reveal their relationship to Richard's wife, Richard slaps her, and she runs off into the desert, pursued by the three men. Richard then shoves her off a cliff and she is impaled by a tree branch. Believing Jen to be dead, Richard assures his friends that they can finish their trip before anyone finds the body. Jen regains consciousness, and while bleeding, is able to painfully free herself, but with a piece of the tree branch still stuck through her torso. When the men return, she hides. With night approaching, they split up to cover more ground. Jen catches Dimitri alone, but he grabs her face and holds her underwater. She grabs his hunting knife and stabs him in the eye. With Dimitri dead, Jen takes his shotgun and hides in a cave. She remembers she has Richard's peyote and takes it, before entering a heightened state of mind when she removes the branch and heats a beer can in the fire to cauterize the wound. The artwork on the can leaves a perfect brand/scar of a phoenix on her belly. After a series of nightmares of the men hunting her, Jen leaves the cave to deal with them. Richard and Stan find Dimitri's body in the water. Stan takes the SUV to continue the hunt, but while filling the gas tank, Jen ambushes him. A bloody gunfight follows, and Stan is shot and killed by Jen while trying to run her over. After not being able to contact Stan on the radio, Richard speeds back home and calls a helicopter to pick him up. While showering, he hears a noise. Jen surprises him and manages to shoot him in the stomach. The two chase each other around the house with shotguns as Richard's blood covers every floor and wall. Despite his blood loss, Richard is able to catch Jen and begins strangling her, but Jen forces her hand into his exposed stomach, allowing her to retake the gun and ultimately shoot Richard dead. A bloodied but triumphant Jen walks out of the house as she hears the helicopter approach.",

James\nin the July-August 2009 Issue\n\nJust as the action in Park Chan-wook’s Thirst is getting under way, Tae-ju (Kim Ok-vin) challenges Sang-hyun, the young Catholic priest she’s just started fucking, to prove that he’s really a vampire. Sweeping her up in his arms, he leaps from the rooftop of the high building where they’ve met up; though they float down safely, she’s soaring, dizzy at the prospect of hanging with a vampire and even becoming one herself. From this point on, it’s Kim Ok-vin’s movie. Guilt-ridden, Sang-hyun is sure they are both going to hell; but since she’s not a believer, she’s determined to bleed vampiredom for all its worth. Right up to the inevitable, and nicely conceived, ending, her fun makes a mockery of mor(t)ality.\n\nThe intro shows Sang-hyun (played by Song Kang-ho, star of the blockbuster The Host) giving himself to Jesus by volunteering to be injected with a trial vaccine for a disease that causes the skin to erupt in boils followed by internal bleeding and a grotesque death. The disease kills him, but unlike the other guinea pigs, he comes back to life. The rub, though, is that one of the transfusions he had has turned him into a vampire, and only fresh blood can stop the return of the boils. Some of it he gets by supping at the transfusion tube of a comatose patient in the clinic where he ministers, but most comes from the family of a childhood friend he’s called in to save: Tae-ju, her idiot husband, his mother, and various friends who come by to play mahjong, including a Filipina mail-order bride.\n\nBetween the beginning and end of the romance between Tae-ju and Sang-hyun, there’s not so much a plot as a series of incidents in which the family members are bled dry. These are anchored in recurring symmetrically centered, stationary compositions, but in between, all hell breaks loose in the form of surreal subjective interludes, bombastic imagistic montages, and of course the gory set pieces. My favorite occurs just after Sang-hyun has broken Tae-ju’s neck: to bring her back to life, he slashes his own wrists and forces his blood into her mouth while at the same time sucking it back out through one of her wrists. In Park’s earlier “vengeance trilogy,” skewed but urgent psychological motivation made comparable scenes horrific and harrowing, but here they topple over into camp. Whether the blood is imbibed from carotid arteries suddenly ruptured by a stab from a pair of kitchen shears or disgorged in a projectile vomit across a virginal white room, the excess is as much comic as chilling, so Churriguer-esque is the guignol. As in the work of Kenneth Anger, whose identification of God and the Devil and comic-book flippancy the film recalls, multiple superimposed ironies feed gravitas into comedy and back again.\n\nThough lacking a dramatic structure, the film is tightly knitted with echoing motifs, and periodically it spews up tensile narrative ironies: for example, Sang-hyun and Tae-ju drown her idiot husband in a lake, but he returns grinning through their water bed to haunt their lovemaking. Kim Ok-vin is the film’s saving grace; as one of the soon-to-be slaughtered family friends remarks, her eyes express everything between yes and no, and she is demonically able to shift through a whole lexicon of contradictory emotions in one blink.\n\nDoubtless there’s a theme or even a moral here: something to do with guilt and redemption, or perhaps “When you’re dead, you’re dead—even if you were already undead.” But whatever it is, it’s not much more than a vehicle for the gore, and these days vampires don’t have much fright value left. The night I saw Park’s contribution to the blood bank, the cover of the new TV Guide announced the next season of True Blood with a line that could have been used for Thirst: “Hot Vampires in Love.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom the  Issue\n\nCategories:\n\n### Related\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Inland Empires\n\nMarch 3, 2025\n\nAlone again or: Ben Rivers’s latest —a continuation of the British filmmaker’s collaboration with a hermit—is notable for its exquisite play with duration, attention, and the very form of the observational documentary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Berlinale 2025: All That Is Solid\n\nMarch 3, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### The Film Comment Podcast: Oscars 2025 Preview with The Los Angeles Review of Books\n\nFebruary 28, 2025\n\nPain and glory:  Eric Newman and Paul Thompson, editors of the Los Angeles Review of Books, join to discuss, debate, and dismantle this year’s nominees, from  to  to , and more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### The Film Comment Podcast: The Frederick Wiseman Potluck\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\nBon appetit: Andrew Katzenstein, Genevieve Yue, and Michael Blair join the FC editors to dish up favorite titles from the legendary American filmmaker’s body of work\n\n### Related\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Inland Empires\n\nMarch 3, 2025\n\nAlone again or: Ben Rivers’s latest —a continuation of the British filmmaker’s collaboration with a hermit—is notable for its exquisite play with duration, attention, and the very form of the observational documentary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Berlinale 2025: All That Is Solid\n\nMarch 3, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### The Film Comment Podcast: Oscars 2025 Preview with The Los Angeles Review of Books\n\nFebruary 28, 2025\n\nPain and glory:  Eric Newman and Paul Thompson, editors of the Los Angeles Review of Books, join to discuss, debate, and dismantle this year’s nominees, from  to  to , and more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### The Film Comment Podcast: The Frederick Wiseman Potluck\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\nBon appetit: Andrew Katzenstein, Genevieve Yue, and Michael Blair join the FC editors to dish up favorite titles from the legendary American filmmaker’s body of work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Events\n- About\n- Advertise\n- Stay Connected\n\nPublished by Film at Lincoln Center\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sign up for the Film Comment Letter!\n\nThoughtful, original film criticism delivered straight to your inbox each week.

Right up to the inevitable, and nicely conceived, ending, her fun makes a mockery of morality.\n\n        The intro shows <character>Sang-hyun</character> (played by <actor>Song Kang-ho</actor>, star of the blockbuster <movie>The Host</movie>) giving himself to Jesus by volunteering to be injected with a trial vaccine for a disease that causes the skin to erupt in boils followed by internal bleeding and a grotesque death. The disease kills him, but unlike the other guinea pigs, he comes back to life. The rub, though, is that one of the transfusions he had has turned him into a vampire, and only fresh blood can stop the return of the boils. Some of it he gets by supping at the transfusion tube of a comatose patient in the clinic where he ministers, but most comes from the family of a childhood friend he’s called in to save: <character>Tae-ju</character>, her idiot husband, his mother, and various friends who come by to play mahjong, including a Filipina mail-order bride.\n\n        Between the beginning and end of the romance between <character>Tae-ju</character> and <character>Sang-hyun</character>, there’s not so much a plot as a series of incidents in which the family members are bled dry. These are anchored in recurring symmetrically centered, stationary compositions, but in between, all hell breaks loose in the form of surreal subjective interludes, bombastic imagistic montages, and of course the gory set pieces. My favorite occurs just after <character>Sang-hyun</character> has broken <character>Tae-ju</character>’s neck: to bring her back to life, he slashes his own wrists and forces his blood into her mouth while at the same time sucking it back out through one of her wrists. In <director>Park</director>’s earlier “vengeance trilogy,” skewed but urgent psychological motivation made comparable scenes horrific and harrowing, but here they topple over into camp. Whether the blood is imbibed from carotid arteries suddenly ruptured by a stab from a pair of kitchen shears or disgorged in a projectile vomit across a virginal white room, the excess is as much comic as chilling, so Churriguer-esque is the guignol. As in the work of <director>Kenneth Anger</director>, whose identification of God and the Devil and comic-book flippancy the film recalls, multiple superimposed ironies feed gravitas into comedy and back again.\n\n        Though lacking a dramatic structure, the film is tightly knitted with echoing motifs, and periodically it spews up tensile narrative ironies: for example, <character>Sang-hyun</character> and <character>Tae-ju</character> drown her idiot husband in a lake, but he returns grinning through their water bed to haunt their lovemaking. <actor>Kim Ok-vin</actor> is the film’s saving grace; as one of the soon-to-be slaughtered family friends remarks, her eyes express everything between yes and no, and she is demonically able to shift through a whole lexicon of contradictory emotions in one blink.\n\n        Doubtless there’s a theme or even a moral here: something to do with guilt and redemption, or perhaps “When you’re dead, you’re dead—even if you were already undead.” But whatever it is, it’s not much more than a vehicle for the gore, and these days vampires don’t have much fright value left. The night I saw <director>Park</director>’s contribution to the blood bank, the cover of the new TV Guide announced the next season of <show>True Blood</show> with a line that could have been used for <movie>Thirst</movie>: “Hot Vampires in Love.”\n    </content>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have wrapped the relevant segments with the appropriate XML tags based on the attributes defined in the ADT.

With widespread releases like Parasite garnering attention on a mainstream international level and recognizable faces appearing in quiet dramas like Burning, it appears that the appreciation international film buffs have been displaying for some time now is being shared on a larger scale. Which obviously means it’s time to revisit the insane Korean horror movies studded with extreme gore, complex characters, and incredibly murky morals like Jee-woon Kim’s thriller I Saw The Devil (2010).\n\nBefore getting into the synopsis, I feel it necessary to explain that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but watched it casually when it came on Pluto Terror (I also caught The Wailing the same week in a similar fashion so... good week all in all) and was not prepared for what I saw. Obviously, this has colored my perspective on the film and the gray areas on which the audience was intended to muse. Having said that, let’s begin:\n\nA school bus driver comes across a young woman waiting in her car on the side of a snowy road. He offers her help though she insists she’s fine. For a moment, she is left alone but then the driver returns with a hammer and forces his way into her car, smashing her several times in the head before dragging her body back to his vehicle. When the young woman awakes, she is wrapped in plastic in the driver’s lair.  Begging him not to kill her, she tells him she’s pregnant. She is then decapitated; her engagement ring rolls into a grate as the driver cleans up the mess.\n\nUnfortunately for the driver, he just murdered the financee of Kim Soo-hyeon (Lee Byung-hun), an active agent in the National Intelligence Service. The search for his fiancee starts after part of her ear is found, and the final grim discovery is her severed head, which is accidentally dropped and rolls to Kim’s feet. (Please note that all this happens quite close to the beginning of the movie. I Saw The Devil is not here for the slow burn.)\n\nKim sets off on his own mission to find the killer. He is told of four possible suspects, two of whom he tortures and brutalizes until he is convinced they’re not the killer. At the home of the third suspect Jang Kyung-chul (Choi Min-sik), he discovers his fiancee’s engagement ring, proving Jang’s guilt – his grisly fate, as we will come to see, is now sealed.\n\nAs Jang is sexually assaulting a school girl he lured to him, Kim finds him, overpowers him and then knocks him unconscious by beating his head into a rock. He inserts a GPS tracker into Jang’s body via his throat then vanishes. When Jang regains consciousness, he stumbles along the road until he is picked up by two men in a taxi who plan to rob and murder him. Jang kills them both first, dispatches of their bodies and the body of the slaughtered cab driver he finds in the trunk then proceeds to a hospital to get medical attention and sexually assault a nurse. Like magic, Kim shows up and slices Jang’s achilles tendon before again disappearing.\n\nWhile visiting his fellow murderer and friend Tae-joo, a man who has a live-in girlfriend despite being a cannibal, Jang is again followed and attacked by Kim. All three of the criminals (Jang, Tae-joo, and his girlfriend Se-jung) are incapcitated and hospitalized. Jang overhears Kim and another agent discussing the tracker, and at the hospital, he steals laxatives to flush it out then later plants it on a truck driver he savagely pummels.\n\nKim kidnaps Jang one final time after Tae-joo (Moo-Seong Choi) reveals that Jang is headed to the house of his fiancee’s (and his squad chief’s) family. Placed in an elaborate guillotine, Jang is forced to hold the rope of the mechanism between his teeth in order to keep himself from decapitation. When his estranged parents and child start knocking on the door, he begs them through clenched jaws to leave but they let themselves in and cause another mechanism rigged up by Kim to behead Jang right in front of them.\n\nIn the end and after his ethically nebulous mission is completed, Kim is seen walking down the side of the road, crying with each step.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClearly, the audience is supposed to meditate on the idea of the purpose of revenge and justice – how is either served and where the lines are that demarcate someone as a righteous vigilante or a depraved psycho no better than the ones they are fighting. The title, as well as the main poster art, points to an ambiguous answer as to who the true devil is, playing on the Nietzsche quote of hunting monsters and becoming one. The problem for me when it comes to this ambiguity is that I remained on Kim’s side throughout the entire movie. Even in the grand finale where Jang’s poor family is witness to his gruesome death, I found myself thinking that it was the perfect insult to injury: the family he abandoned and whose shame he couldn’t bear should they discover his true nature are no longer oblivious to the person he was. I was so strongly ‘Team Kim’ that the moral gray area and the question of is sheer vengeance ever justified didn’t really deter me. Jang’s crimes are so horrific and he is so without remorse or even internal conflict that I found immense catharsis in watching Kim’s mission. I don’t mean this so much as a negative criticism of the film but rather as pointing to a personal reaction which might not be the norm.\n\nMany analyses and reviews of this movie use the word ‘unflinching’ to describe the graphic scenes, and mine will be no different. There’s really no other way to accurately convey the violence both against the female victims of the serial killers and the violence rendered upon them. At some points during the most grotesque moments, the shots of what was going on were almost clinical, without pathos or flair. Like the unpleasant ending of Pascal Languir’s Martyrs, the carnage was presented in a more matter-of-fact way rather than stylized. Adding to that are scenes of clean up and daily activities which remind the viewer of how we want people like Jang to be monsters instead of flesh and blood humans. This isn’t a movie where the killer is almost magical in their ability to remove evidence and get rid of bodies; we watch the routine of Jang sweeping viscera into a grate as if doing maintenance on a work space.\n\nThough I do not condemn Kim’s behavior, the movie is populated with characters expressing concern and doubt despite not knowing even half of what he’s doing. His fiancee’s sister tells him no amount of inflicted pain can bring back their lost loved one. Colleagues push him to take more time off to grieve instead of returning to work after two weeks and immediately joining the investigation. Outside of himself, people can see the damage this is doing to Kim, and know full well how his actions will tarnish him irrevocably. The moment in the hospital when the cannibal Tae-joo’s jaw is broken by Kim seems to express the mania and obsessive nature of Kim’s goal. He has information Kim needs on the whereabouts of Jang and Kim has no qualms in doing what he feels has to be done.\n\nNow, regardless of how I feel, the final image of Kim alone and crying doesn’t exactly support the idea of him being at peace with the loss of his fiancee and unborn baby. Yet it does point to the fact that he is not a monster lacking a moral compass, clearly navigating an absolute tangle of emotions. Between the depth of character and the flawless acting, I Saw The Devil is able to present a portrait of a hero and a villian that brings sympathy to the surface but doesn’t condone or absolve the decisions made by either.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAside from the content of the movie, a lot needs to be said about the look of the movie and how beautifully it utilizes what could otherwise be seen as banal. Against the horrific moments with their clinical eye are snowy landscapes and pinkly glowing horizons. The opening scene where Jang attacks the young woman in the car is simple and cleanly shot, using the snow and the streetlights as commonplace beauty. Great looking gore is not a new trend, but unlike Italian giallo movies which revelled in art direction and artifice (not a dig, I adore them), I Saw The Devil pulls the exquisite out from the background, displaying what can be striking and disturbing in reality. A blanket of snow sporting a serpentine streak of blood or a search party unfolding across a wide open vista become subtly arresting images in the hands of director Kim Jee-woon. It’s no wonder that even critics who lambasted the movie as ‘offensive’ and ‘repugnant’ mention its aesthetic appeal.\n\nI now join the legion of I Saw The Devil fans who are always clamoring for this film to be seen by a broader audience, though I am unsure of who that audience would be. Since there are more Korean films making their way to the mainstream, I wonder if soon there will be a space for a piece of work like this one. There’s plenty of torture porn and grisly horror movies gobbled up by the masses, advertised across all forms of media and score huge opening weekends like the continuing Saw franchise but I Saw The Devil might fall too much in between genres to really be the full-on hit it deserves to be. It’s quite long (141 minutes) and has lots of scenes of people struggling with complicated emotions. Motives often go unexplained. Lots of backstory is purposefully missing. In a perfect world, a movie like this would be widely recognized, but we do not live in a perfect world, as the film itself can tell you. We are imperfect creatures flailing through complex lives, and sometimes the moral of the story is that there’s no easy answer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVeronica is a writer, theater type, the drag performer Titus Androgynous, and all-around hedonist living in San Francisco.

It stars Rolf Lassgård in the title role.[3]\n\nThe film was released theatrically in Sweden on 25 December 2015. It was nominated for six awards, winning two, at the 51st Guldbagge Awards in 2016.[4][5] At the 89th Academy Awards, it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Makeup and Hairstyling.[6][7][8][9]\n\n## Plot\n\nOve Lindahl, a 59-year-old widower, lives in a townhouse neighborhood where he once chaired the association until his friend Rune replaced him. Rune, now paralyzed from a stroke, is cared for by his wife, Anita. Since his wife Sonja, a schoolteacher, died from cancer six months ago, Ove has been depressed. Forced into retirement from the railroad company where he worked for 43 years, Ove's routine involves enforcing neighborhood rules and visiting Sonja's grave to talk to her.\n\nAfter sorting out his affairs, Ove tries to hang himself, triggering a flashback to his childhood. His mother's death left him with his silent father, a mechanic at the train company. His father's excitement about Ove's academic success leads to a fatal accident when he's hit by a train while spreading the news.\n\nIn the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Iranian immigrant Parvaneh, her Swedish husband Patrick, and their children moving in across the street. Her persistence breaks through Ove's tough exterior, causing him to abandon the noose for carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nAs Ove drifts into unconsciousness, memories flood back of \"the Whiteshirts\" trying to demolish his childhood home, which he defiantly repairs. A fire started by a neighbor leads to Ove also losing his home, forcing him to sleep on a train where he meets Sonja. Smitten, he starts dating her, and she inspires him to pursue an engineering degree.\n\nIn the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted again by Parvaneh needing a ride to the hospital for her husband's accident. After reluctantly helping, Ove ends up supervising Parvaneh and Patrick's daughters in the lobby, causing a scene and being asked to leave. Later, at the train station, he plans to end his life but instead saves a man who faints onto the tracks. His heroic act catches the attention of Lena, a local reporter, whom he evades with Parvaneh's help.\n\nParvaneh persuades Ove to teach her how to drive, leading to conversations about his past friendship with Rune and their falling out over car preferences. At Parvaneh's insistence, Ove reluctantly takes in a stray cat, and starts to bond with it. He also repairs a confiscated bike for a local teen named Adrian, who works at a kebab shop with Mirsad. Ove notices Mirsad's eye makeup but doesn't judge him.\n\nDespite improving relations with his neighbors, Ove clashes with two Whiteshirts. He then tries to end his life with a shotgun but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad seeking refuge after Mirsad's family disowns him for coming out as gay. Reluctantly, Ove offers him shelter.\n\nOve learns that the Whiteshirts plan to move Rune to a nursing home, information Anita kept from him and Sonja. Ove realizes his grudge against Rune was foolish and declares war on the Whiteshirts. However, his confrontations yield little results.\n\nFrustrated, Ove shares with Parvaneh about a tragic vacation in Spain with a pregnant Sonja that ended in a bus crash. Despite Ove's efforts, Sonja lost the baby and was left paraplegic, leading Ove to build a wheelchair ramp at her school when authorities failed to do so.\n\nIn the present day, journalist Lena confronts the Whiteshirts with evidence of their financial misconduct, leading to their retreat in the face of public scrutiny. Backed by supportive neighbors, Anita prevents Rune's forced relocation, allowing Ove to reconcile with him.\n\nLater, Ove collapses and is hospitalized with an enlarged heart. Parvaneh gives birth to a son while teasing Ove about his failed attempts at dying. Ove gifts his unborn child's crib to Parvaneh and forms a close bond with her daughters, who affectionately call him grandpa.\n\nMonths pass, and during a winter storm, Ove is found peacefully dead in his bed, with his cat by his side. His modest funeral is attended by numerous neighbors, symbolizing the impact he had on their lives. Finally at peace, Ove awakens on a train to find Sonja sitting across from him once more.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Rolf Lassgård as Ove\n- Bahar Pars as Parvaneh\n- Filip Berg as Young Ove\n- Ida Engvoll as Sonja\n- Tobias Almborg as Patrick (Lufsen)\n- Klas Wiljergård (sv) as Jimmy\n- Chatarina Larsson as Anita\n- Börje Lundberg as Rune\n- Stefan Gödicke as Ove's Father\n- Johan Widerberg as The Whiteshirt\n- Anna-Lena Bergelin as Journalist Lena\n- Nelly Jamarani as Sepideh (Parvaneh's daughter)\n- Zozan Akgün as Nasanin (Parvaneh's daughter)\n- Viktor Baagøe as 7-year-old Ove\n- Simon Edenroth as Adrian\n- Poyan Karimi as Mirsad\n- Maja Rung as Young Anita\n- Simeon Da Costa Maya as Young Rune\n- Jessica Olsson as Mähät\n- Fredrik Evers as Anders\n- Ola Hedén as Tom\n- Lasse Carlsson as Ove's Colleague\n- Anna Granath as Beppo the Clown\n- Emelie Strömberg as flowershop worker\n- Christoffer Nordenrot as a Whiteshirt\n- Simon Reithner as White Shirt Man 2\n- Jerker Fahlström as Conductor\n- Johanna Karlberg as DIY store clerk\n- Johan Friberg as Director\n- Erik Ståhlberg as the Whiteshirt (flashback)\n- Magnus Sundberg as necktatooed man\n- Karin de Frumerie as Ove's doctor\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 121 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A Man Called Ove's winsome sincerity — and Rolf Lassgård's affectingly flinty performance in the title role — keep it from succumbing to excess sentimentality.\"[10] On Metacritic, which assigns a rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[11]\n\nThe Washington Post,[12] Chicago Tribune[13] and RogerEbert.com[14] gave positive reviews. Reviewers have noted that while elements and formulas are familiar from films such as St. Vincent and Gran Torino, A Man Called Ove is well made and capable of bringing real tears to the audience's eyes.[12][15][16]\n\nAs of 2023[update], the film is the third most watched Swedish theatrical film in Sweden of all time.[17][18]\n\n### Accolades\n\nRolf Lassgård was awarded the Best Actor award at the 51st Guldbagge Awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Award                                          | Date of ceremony    | Category                    | Recipient(s)                                               | Result    |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards[19][20]                         | 26 February 2017    | Best Foreign Language Film  | Sweden                                                     | Nominated |\n| Academy Awards[19][20]                         | 26 February 2017    | Best Makeup and Hairstyling | Eva von Bahr and Love Larson                               | Nominated |\n| Cabourg Film Festival                          | 11 June 2016        | Essilor Audience Award      | A Man Called Ove                                           | Won       |\n| European Film Awards[21]                       | 10 December 2016    | European Comedy             | A Man Called Ove                                           | Won       |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Best Film                   | Annica Bellander and Fredrik Wikström Nicastro (Producers) | Nominated |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Best Actor                  | Rolf Lassgård                                              | Won       |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Best Supporting Actress     | Bahar Pars                                                 | Nominated |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Best Cinematography         | Göran Hallberg                                             | Nominated |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Makeup and Hair             | Eva von Bahr and Love Larson                               | Won       |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Best Visual Effects         | Torbjörn Olsson                                            | Nominated |\n| Guldbagge Awards[4][5]                         | 18 January 2016     | Cinema Audience Award       | A Man Called Ove                                           | Won       |\n| Houston Film Critics Society[22][23]           | 6 January 2017      | Best Foreign Language Film  | A Man Called Ove                                           | Nominated |\n| Satellite Awards[24]                           | 19 February 2017    | Best Foreign Language Film  | A Man Called Ove                                           | Nominated |\n| St. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association[25] | 18 December 2016    | Best Foreign Language Film  | A Man Called Ove                                           | Nominated |\n\n## Remake\n\nA remake was produced in the United States by Tom Hanks, who stars in the film.[26] In January 2022, it was announced that the film, titled A Man Called Otto, would be directed by Marc Forster, with David Magee writing the screenplay.

Rune, now paralyzed from a stroke, is cared for by his wife, Anita. Since his wife Sonja, a schoolteacher, died from cancer six months ago, Ove has been depressed. Forced into retirement from the railroad company where he worked for 43 years, Ove's routine involves enforcing neighborhood rules and visiting Sonja's grave to talk to her. After sorting out his affairs, Ove tries to hang himself, triggering a flashback to his childhood. His mother's death left him with his silent father, a mechanic at the train company. His father's excitement about Ove's academic success leads to a fatal accident when he's hit by a train while spreading the news. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Iranian immigrant Parvaneh, her Swedish husband Patrick, and their children moving in across the street. Her persistence breaks through Ove's tough exterior, causing him to abandon the noose for carbon monoxide poisoning. As Ove drifts into unconsciousness, memories flood back of 'the Whiteshirts' trying to demolish his childhood home, which he defiantly repairs. A fire started by a neighbor leads to Ove also losing his home, forcing him to sleep on a train where he meets Sonja. Smitten, he starts dating her, and she inspires him to pursue an engineering degree. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted again by Parvaneh needing a ride to the hospital for her husband's accident. After reluctantly helping, Ove ends up supervising Parvaneh and Patrick's daughters in the lobby, causing a scene and being asked to leave. Later, at the train station, he plans to end his life but instead saves a man who faints onto the tracks. His heroic act catches the attention of Lena, a local reporter, whom he evades with Parvaneh's help. Parvaneh persuades Ove to teach her how to drive, leading to conversations about his past friendship with Rune and their falling out over car preferences. At Parvaneh's insistence, Ove reluctantly takes in a stray cat, and starts to bond with it. He also repairs a confiscated bike for a local teen named Adrian, who works at a kebab shop with Mirsad. Ove notices Mirsad's eye makeup but doesn't judge him. Despite improving relations with his neighbors, Ove clashes with two Whiteshirts. He then tries to end his life with a shotgun but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad seeking refuge after Mirsad's family disowns him for coming out as gay. Reluctantly, Ove offers him shelter. Ove learns that the Whiteshirts plan to move Rune to a nursing home, information Anita kept from him and Sonja. Ove realizes his grudge against Rune was foolish and declares war on the Whiteshirts. However, his confrontations yield little results. Frustrated, Ove shares with Parvaneh about a tragic vacation in Spain with a pregnant Sonja that ended in a bus crash. Despite Ove's efforts, Sonja lost the baby and was left paraplegic, leading Ove to build a wheelchair ramp at her school when authorities failed to do so. In the present day, journalist Lena confronts the Whiteshirts with evidence of their financial misconduct, leading to their retreat in the face of public scrutiny. Backed by supportive neighbors, Anita prevents Rune's forced relocation, allowing Ove to reconcile with him. Later, Ove collapses and is hospitalized with an enlarged heart. Parvaneh gives birth to a son while teasing Ove about his failed attempts at dying. Ove gifts his unborn child's crib to Parvaneh and forms a close bond with her daughters, who affectionately call him grandpa. Months pass, and during a winter storm, Ove is found peacefully dead in his bed, with his cat by his side. His modest funeral is attended by numerous neighbors, symbolizing the impact he had on their lives.

It is based on the novel The Treasure by Selma Lagerlöf, originally published in 1903. The story takes place on the Swedish west coast during the 16th century, and revolves around a Scottish mercenary who murders a wealthy family for treasure, only to unwittingly begin a relationship with the surviving daughter of the family.\n\n## Plot\n\nAfter discovering a conspiracy among his Scottish mercenaries, king Johan III of Sweden orders them to leave the country and puts their commanders in jail. Sir Archie, Sir Filip and Sir Donald, three of the imprisoned commanders, escape and flee to Marstrand, then under Danish rule, in hope of being able to return to Scotland.\n\nSir Arne of Solberga is introduced as a vicar and wealthy man who is said to be under a curse as his treasure - a chest full of silver coins - is said to have been looted from the monasteries during the Protestant reform and, according to premonitions, will one day be his doom. While dining, Arne's wife has a premonition that three rogues are sharpening very long knives nearby, but is not taken seriously. At night, however, the three mercenaries enter the family's mansion, murder the family, steal Sir Arne's treasure chest and burn down the building. The only survivor is the daughter, Elsalill.\n\nElsalill is taken care of by a travelling fishmonger who happens to be there and lets her live with him and his mother in Marstrand, where the Scottish officers have arrived and are waiting for the ice to break so they can sail away. Elsalill encounters Sir Archie, and they fall in love without recognising each other. Eventually however, Elsalill happens to overhear a conversation between the Scots, and understands who they are. She reports them to the town guard but the three repel the guard trying to arrest them as they are backed up by other mercenaries who are also waiting for the first ship to leave. Sir Archie seeks Elsahill to try to persuade hr to come to Scotland and explains that he deeply regrets his crime but, as the town guard attack, Elsalill is fatally wounded when Sir Archie uses her as a human shield.\n\nSir Archie escapes to the frozen-in ship with Elsalill's body. The ice still hasn't broken however, and according to sailor's lore it is because there are evildoers on board, a fact confirmed by the fishmonger seeking Elsahill. The three officers are identified and thrown off the ship. A long procession march over the ice ensues to fetch Elsalill's body and bring it back to land.\n\n## Cast\n\nJohnson in the film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Richard Lund as Sir Archie\n- Mary Johnson as Elsalill\n- Hjalmar Selander as Sir Arne\n- Concordia Selander as Sir Arne's wife\n- Wanda Rothgardt as Berghild\n- Axel Nilsson as Torarin\n- Erik Stocklassa as Sir Filip\n- Bror Berger as Sir Donald\n- Josua Bengtson as Jailer\n\n## Production\n\nThe first plan for a film adaption of Selma Lagerlöf's The Treasure at Svenska Biografteatern, the dominating production company in Sweden during the silent era, was in 1915, but fell through. In 1917 a stage adaptation of the story premiered at Deutsches Theater in Berlin, and an offer was received from a German film company which wanted to adapt it. After the play was staged in Gothenburg the following year, Svenska Biografteatern decided to go ahead and produce the film themselves. The screenplay by Mauritz Stiller and Gustaf Molander differs from the novel in that it tells the story in a more strictly chronological order, and incorporates some details which were introduced in the German play. Stiller also chose to tone down the story's supernatural elements.[1]\n\nFilming took place from 12 February to 10 May 1919, in the studio area of Svenska Filmbiografen, later AB Svensk Filmindustri, on Lidingö, Stockholm, where the alleys of Marstrand had been reconstructed. Other exterior scenes were shot in the nearby area on Lidingö and Lilla Värtan, as well as around Furusund in the Stockholm archipelago, where the ship had been left over the winter and frozen in. Some filming took place further north in Skutskär, and around Sollefteå in Ångermanland.[1][2]\n\nThe film featured handwritten intertitles by Alva Lundin and was the first film to use her artistic title cards.[3]\n\n## Other adaptations\n\nTwo other film adaptations of the story exist. In 1954 Gustaf Molander directed another Swedish version. A Czechoslovak animated short film directed by Václav Bedřich was made in 1967.[1]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Herr Arnes Pengar (1919): Kommentar Svensk filmografi\".

Consisting partly of documentary-style storytelling as well as dramatized narrative sequences, the film purports to chart the historical roots and superstitions surrounding witchcraft, beginning in the Middle Ages through the 20th century. Based partly on Christensen's own study of the Malleus Maleficarum, a 15th-century German guide for inquisitors, Häxan proposes that such witch-hunts may have stemmed from misunderstandings of mental or neurological disorders, triggering mass hysteria.[3]\n\nThe movie was produced by Swedish AB Svensk Filmindustri but shot in Denmark in 1920–1921.[4] With Christensen's meticulous recreation of medieval scenes and its lengthy production period, the film was the most expensive Scandinavian silent film ever made at the time, costing nearly two million Swedish kronor.[3] Although it received some positive reception in Denmark and Sweden, censors in countries such as Germany, France, and the United States objected to what were considered at that time graphic depictions of torture, nudity, and sexual perversion, as well as anti-clericalism.[5][6]\n\nIn 1968, Metro Pictures Corporation re-edited and re-released Häxan in the US under the title Witchcraft Through the Ages. This version includes an English-language narration by William S. Burroughs. The original Swedish-language version of Häxan has undergone three restorations by the Swedish Film Institute, carried out in 1976, 2007 and 2016. Since its initial release, Häxan has received praise for its combination of documentary-style and narrative storytelling, as well as its visual imagery, and has been called Christensen's masterpiece.[7]\n\n## Plot\n\nHäxan (1922)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Part 1\n\nThis geocentric model of the universe, similar to a model used in the film, depicts the Earth at the universe's center, surrounded by layers of air and fire, the Solar System, the stars, and finally God with choirs of angels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA scholarly dissertation on the appearances of demons and witches in primitive and medieval culture, the first segment of the film uses a number of photographs of statuary, paintings, and woodcuts as demonstrative pieces. In addition, several large scale models are employed to demonstrate medieval concepts of the structure of the Solar System and the commonly accepted depiction of Hell.\n\n### Part 2\n\nThe second segment of the film is a series of vignettes that theatrically demonstrate medieval superstition and beliefs concerning witchcraft, including Satan tempting a sleeping woman away from her husband's bed, terrorizing a group of monks, then murdering another woman in her bed by choking her. Also shown is a woman purchasing a love potion from a supposed witch named Karna in order to seduce a monk, and a supposed witch named Apelone dreaming of waking up in a castle, where Satan presents her with coins that she is unable to hold on to and festivities that she is unable to participate in.\n\n### Parts 3–5\n\nSet in the Middle Ages, this narrative is used to demonstrate the treatment of suspected witches by the religious authorities of the time. A printer named Jesper dies in bed, and his family consequently accuses an old woman, Maria the weaver, of causing his death through witchcraft. Jesper's wife Anna visits the residence of traveling Inquisition judges, grasping one of their arms in desperation and asking that they try Maria for witchcraft.\n\nMaria is arrested, and after being tortured by inquisitors, admits to involvement in witchcraft. She describes giving birth to children fathered by Satan, being smeared with witch ointment, and attending a Witches' Sabbath, where she claims witches and sorcerers desecrated a cross, feasted with demons, and kissed Satan's buttocks. She \"names\" other supposed witches, including two of the women in Jesper's household. Eventually, Anna is arrested as a witch when the inquisitor whose arm she grabbed accuses her of bewitching him. She is tricked into what is perceived as a confession, and is sentenced to be burned at the stake. Intertitles claim that over eight million women, men and children were burned as witches.[a]\n\n### Parts 6–7\n\nThe final segments of the film seek to demonstrate how the superstitions of old have become better understood. Christensen offers the threat of medieval torture methods as an explanation for why many supposed heretics confessed to being involved in witchcraft. Though he does not deny the existence of the Devil, Christensen claims that those accused of witchcraft may have been suffering from what are recognized in modern times as mental or neurological disorders. A nun named Sister Cecilia is depicted as being coerced by Satan into desecrating a consecrated host and stealing a statue of the baby Jesus. Her actions are then contrasted with vignettes about a somnambulist, a pyromaniac, and a kleptomaniac. It is suggested that such behaviors would have been thought of as demonically-influenced in medieval times, whereas modern societies recognize them as psychological ailments (referred to in the film as hysteria). The film ends with a contrast between a woman being sent away to a mental institution and a scene with burning supposed witches on the stake.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe cast of Häxan includes:[1]\n\n- Benjamin Christensen as the Devil\n- Ella la Cour as Sorceress Karna\n- Emmy Schønfeld as Karna's Assistant\n- Kate Fabian as the Old Maid\n- Oscar Stribolt as Fat Monk\n- Wilhelmine Henriksen as Apelone\n- Astrid Holm as Anna, wife of Jesper the printer\n- Elisabeth Christensen as Anna's Mother\n- Karen Winther as Anna's Sister\n- Maren Pedersen as the Witch (Maria the Weaver)\n- Johannes Andersen as Pater Henrik, Witch Judge\n- Elith Pio as Johannes, Witch Judge\n- Aage Hertel as Witch Judge\n- Ib Schønberg as Witch Judge\n- Holst Jørgensen as Peter Titta (called \"Ole Kighul\" in Denmark)\n- Clara Pontoppidan as Sister Cecilia, Nun\n- Elsa Vermehren as Flagellating Nun\n- Alice O'Fredericks as Nun\n- Gerda Madsen as Nun\n- Karina Bell as Nun\n- Tora Teje as the Hysterical Woman\n- Poul Reumert as the Jeweller\n- H.C. Nilsen as the Jeweller's Assistant\n- Albrecht Schmidt as the Psychiatrist\n- Knud Rassow as the Anatomist\n\n## Themes and interpretations\n\nThe Witches' Sabbath by Hans Baldung (woodcut), 1508\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWriter Chris Fujiwara notes the way in which the film \"places together, on the same level of cinematic depiction, fact and fiction, objective reality and hallucination.\" He writes that \"The realism with which the fantasy scenes are staged and acted hardly differs from the style of the workshop ones, which we have had no reason not to accept as taking place within reality\", and that, as such, the audience is lead \"into a space where the irrational is always ready to intrude, in lurid forms.\"[6]\n\nFujiwara highlights a moment in the film in which Christensen claims that actress Maren Pedersen, between takes, \"raised her tired face to me and said: 'The devil is real. I have seen him sitting by my bedside.'\"[6] Fujiwara writes: \"No doubt Christensen was conscious of the analogy between the character's confession to the inquisitors and the actor's confession to him, between their torture implements and his camera. By likening his own activity as a director to the deeds of the inquisitors, Christensen puts himself near the head of a self-critical tradition in cinema that would later include Jean-Luc Godard and Abbas Kiarostami.\"[6]\n\nAcademic Chloé Germaine Buckley referred to Häxan's examination of witchcraft as \"quasi-feminist\" in nature, writing: \"Christensen focuses on the history of witchcraft in order to show the way that the oppression of women takes on different guises in different historical periods. Using ideas from the psychoanalytic theory that was emerging at the time, Christensen suggests a link between contemporary diagnoses of hysteria and the European witch-hunts of the medieval and early modern eras. This connection casts the twentieth-century physician who would confine troubled young women in his clinic in the role of inquisitor.\"[9] Buckley connects tropes of witchcraft referenced in Häxan, such as witches consuming infants or transforming into animals, to a perceived \"illegitimacy of female power\", and that, as such, \"the evil-witch stereotype has become such a convenient tool for the propagation of misogynistic ideas.\"[9] She also notes that the film suggests \"an intersection of gender and social class: witches are not only women, they are poor women.\"[9]\n\nRegarding the scenes featuring Sister Cecilia being influenced by Satan in the film's final two segments, author Alain Silver asserts the presence of an underlying theme of sexual repression.[10] He claims that the film has a \"libertarian message\", with demonic possession being a result of the \"unnatural sexual continence that is demanded of the young nuns. The film therefore follows a broadly Freudian line in linking possession to hysteria. The basis of this idea is that repressed sexual desires are dynamic and, rather than lying dormant, actively find ways of being fulfilled in exaggerated and extreme ways.\"[10]\n\n## Production\n\nAfter finding a copy of the Malleus Maleficarum in a Berlin bookshop, Christensen spent two years—from 1919 to 1921—studying manuals, illustrations and treatises on witches and witch-hunting.[3] He included a lengthy bibliography in the original playbill at the film's premiere. He intended to create an entirely new film rather than an adaptation of literary fiction, which was the case for films of that day. \"In principal [sic] I am against these adaptations... I seek to find the way forward to original films.\"[11]\n\nChristensen obtained funding from the large Swedish production company Svensk Filmindustri, preferring it over the local Danish film studios, so that he could maintain complete artistic freedom.[5] He used the money to buy and refurbish the Astra film studio in Hellerup, Denmark. Filming then ran from February through October 1921. Christensen and cinematographer Johan Ankerstjerne filmed only at night or in a closed set to maintain the film's dark hue.[3] Post-production required another year before the film premiered in late 1922. Total cost for Svensk Film, including refurbishing the Astra Film Studio, reached between 1.5 and 2 million kronor, making Häxan the most expensive Scandinavian silent film in history.[5]\n\n### Special effects\n\nWitches flying through the sky\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film makes use of a number of special effects techniques in its depictions of the occult, including puppetry and stop motion animation.[12][13] Various demons are portrayed by actors wearing special-effects makeup;[12] superimposition is used to depict witches flying over villages and having out-of-body experiences in their sleep, and reverse motion is used in one sequence to make coins appear to fly from a table into the air.[12][14]\n\n## Music\n\nHäxan has had numerous different live scores over the years. When it premiered in Sweden, its accompaniment was compiled from pre-existing compositions. Details of the selection, which met with the director's enthusiastic approval, have been lost, but it was probably the same documented music as for the Copenhagen premiere two months later. In Copenhagen, it was played by a 50-piece orchestra, and this score, combining pieces by Schubert, Gluck, and Beethoven, was restored and recorded with a smaller ensemble by arranger/conductor Gillian Anderson for the 2001 Criterion Collection DVD edition.[15][16]\n\n## Releases\n\nThe film premiered on 18 September 1922 in four Swedish cities — Stockholm, Helsingborg, Malmö, and Gothenburg[1]—simultaneously, unusual for Sweden at the time. Häxan received its Danish premiere in Copenhagen on 7 November 1922,[1] and was re-released in Denmark in 1931 with an extended introduction by Christensen. The intertitles were also changed in this version.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1968, Metro Pictures Corporation re-edited and re-released Häxan in the United States as Witchcraft Through the Ages, adding narration by William S. Burroughs and a jazz score by Daniel Humair, which was played by a quintet that included Jean-Luc Ponty on violin.[17]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Contemporary response\n\nHäxan received a somewhat lukewarm, but mostly positive, response from critics upon its original release. As academic James Kendrick wrote, initial reviewers of the film \"were confounded by [its] boundary-crossing aesthetic.\"[18] Its thematic content stirred controversy as well. A contemporary critic in Variety, for example, praised the film's acting, production, and its many scenes of \"unadulterated horror\", but added that \"wonderful though this picture is, it is absolutely unfit for public exhibition.\"[19] A Copenhagen reviewer was likewise offended by \"the satanic, perverted cruelty that blazes out of it, the cruelty we all know has stalked the ages like an evil shaggy beast, the chimera of mankind. But when it is captured, let it be locked up in a cell, either in a prison or a madhouse. Do not let it be presented with music by Wagner or Chopin, [...] to young men and women, who have entered the enchanted world of a movie theatre.\"[20]\n\nConversely, a critic for The New York Times wrote in 1929: \"The picture is, for the most part, fantastically conceived and directed, holding the onlooker in a sort of medieval spell. Most of the characters seem to have stepped from primitive paintings.\"[20] The film also came to acquire a cult following among surrealists, who greatly admired its subversion of cultural norms of the time.[21]\n\n### Retrospective assessments\n\nHäxan has become regarded by critics and scholars as Christensen's finest work.[7] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 93% approval rating with an average rating of 7.7/10, based on 24 reviews.[22] Häxan is listed in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die by Steven Jay Scheider, who writes: \"Part earnest academic exercise in correlating ancient fears with misunderstandings about mental illness and part salacious horror movie, Häxan is truly a unique work that still holds power to unnerve, even in today's jaded era.\"[23] Author James J. Mulay praised the film's makeup effects, sets, costumes, and casting, as well as Christensen's \"dynamic combination of both stage tricks and innovative camera techniques [...] [that he uses] to create his fantastical world.\"[12]\n\nDavid Sanjek of PopMatters wrote: \"The dazzling manner in which Haxan shifts from illustrated lecture to historical reenactment to special effects shots of witches on their broomsticks to modern-dress drama pointed to ways the documentary format could be used that others would not draw on until years into the future.\"[24] Peter Cowie similarly argued in Eighty Years of Cinema that it established Christensen as \"an auteur of uncommon imagination and with a pictorial flair far ahead of his time.\"[7] Time Out London called it a \"weird and rather wonderful brew of fiction, documentary and animation\".[25] Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars, lauding it as \"visually stunning\" and \"genuinely scary\". He additionally praised the director's performance as Satan.[26]\n\nDave Kehr of the Chicago Reader suggested that the film's \"episodic, rhetorical structure [...] would have appealed to Jean-Luc Godard\", and wrote that \"Christensen apparently intended [Häxan] as a serious study of witchcraft (which he diagnoses, in an early pop-Freud conclusion, as female hysteria), but what he really has is a pretense for sadistic pornography. The film has acquired impact with age: instead of seeming quaint, the nude scenes and scatological references now have a crumbly, sinister quality—they seem the survivals of ancient, unhealthy imaginations.\"[27]\n\nGhostwatch screenwriter Stephen Volk regards the film as \"a visceral experience disguised as an erudite thesis\", and sets it in the same league as Nosferatu and Vampyr.[28]\n\n## Restorations and home media\n\nThe Swedish Film Institute has carried out three restorations of Häxan:[29]\n\n- 1976 tinted photochemical restoration\n- 2007 tinted photochemical restoration\n- 2016 tinted digital restoration\n\nThe 1976 restoration was released on DVD in the US and the United Kingdom in 2001 by the Criterion Collection[30] and Tartan Video, along with Witchcraft Through the Ages. The 2007 restoration was released on DVD in Sweden by Svenska Filminstitutet.[31] In 2019, the Criterion Collection released the 2016 digital restoration exclusively on Blu-ray in US.[32]\n\n## See also\n\n- European science in the Middle Ages\n- Haxan Films\n- List of cult films\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ In a 2001 audio commentary featuring film scholar Casper Tybjerg, Tybjerg notes that the actual figure is closer to 50,000.[8] In an essay published by the Criterion Collection, writer and academic Chloé Germaine Buckley refers to the number as being around 80,000.[9]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d The Swedish Film Database: Häxan (1922) Linked 1 April 2015\n- ^ Brownlow, Kevin (1968).

Samantha Morton.[3] Set in Ireland in this adaptation, it had its world premiere in the Special Presentations section of the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.[4] It was a co-production of Norway, United Kingdom, Ireland, and France.\n\nThe film is set in 1890, in County Fermanagh (in what is now Northern Ireland) during the course of a single Midsummer Night. Miss Julie, the daughter of an Anglo-Irish landlord, attempts to seduce her father's peasant valet, John. The affair – overshadowed by power and class – quickly goes to some dark places.[5][6]\n\n## Plot\n\nThe movie starts with a young Miss Julie aimlessly wandering in the empty confines of her family's manor house. We hear her calling to her absent mother and walking by a babbling brook where she sees one of her dolls stuck in a tree. She lets out a snicker at the sight of the abandoned doll, and leaves the brook.\n\nWe jump to Midsummer Night 1890, where the same manor is deserted, save for three individuals; Kathleen the cook (Samantha Morton), John the valet (Colin Farrell) and Miss Julie (Jessica Chastain), the Baron's daughter. Kathleen and John immediately gossip about the lady of the house, specifically how she forced John to dance with her. Kathleen and John are engaged and John doesn't fail to take pleasure in Kathleen's jealous reaction.\n\nAnd then, Miss Julie enters. Kathleen takes her leave to look after Miss Julie's suffering dog, while the young aristocrat, who appears to be in a mischievous sort of mood, traps John. The night grows stranger still, as servant and lady exchange impassioned monologues composed of lustful innuendoes and agonizing tension.\n\nJohn confesses that he's been in love with her since he first laid eyes on her as a child, but the next moment sees him quick to remind her of their vastly different positions in the class system. Miss Julie is just as capricious, ordering John around like a slave, and then transforming into a damsel in distress. The back-and-forth continues, until lust overpowers them both and they end up in John's bedroom. Kathleen listens to their coupling through John's bedroom door before returning to her own bedroom and weeping inconsolably.\n\nBack with Miss Julie, John reveals that he has never been in love with her. When they were children, John reveals that he had the same dirty thoughts about her as every other peasant boy on the estate. To Miss Julie's shock, John then unleashes an escalating barrage of verbal and emotional abuse. He calls her a whore and taunts her with the possibility that he may have gotten her pregnant. As a shattered Miss Julie begins showing signs of psychosis, John orders her to break into her father's desk and steal all of  his money. He promises her that they will use the money to elope and start a hotel in Switzerland.\n\nJohn goes to Kathleen and makes sexual advances to her as well; she rebuffs him angrily. She begins dressing John in his Sunday clothes, announcing that they are going to church together, where John will ask God for forgiveness. John pretends to agree. Kathleen expresses disgust that John has so little respect for his employers as to sleep with Miss Julie, and that Miss Julie lowered herself to sleep with him in turn. She tells him that they will be leaving the house and seeking employment elsewhere.\n\nReturning with the money and the cage which contains her beloved pet bird, Miss Julie watches in horror as John sadistically beheads her bird with a meat cleaver. Having a second breakdown, Miss Julie screams at John, telling him that she hates him and that there is blood between them now.\n\nAs Miss Julie picks up the stolen money from the floor, Kathleen arrives in her Sunday clothes. After listening to Miss Julie's monologue about eloping with John and the hotel in Switzerland, Kathleen gently explains to Miss Julie about the strength she draws from her own Christian faith. Miss Julie expresses sadness that she does not share Kathleen's faith.\n\nBefore she leaves, Kathleen lovingly urges John to come to church with her, saying gently that he can benefit from a good sermon. To Kathleen's visible distress, John refuses.\n\nAs a deeply hurt Kathleen leaves, John gives Miss Julie his straight razor and urges her to commit suicide. Hesitating, Miss Julie expresses fear of going to Hell due to her high social rank. But John replies that Miss Julie is no longer one of the first, having lost her virginity, she is now one of the last.\n\nAs John walks up the castle stairs to deliver the Baron's boots and breakfast, Miss Julie walks to the brook seen in the opening moments of the film. The last image seen before the credits is of Miss Julie lying dead by the brook with the stolen money in a bag around her neck, having slit her wrist with John's straight razor.\n\n## Production\n\nSynnøve Hørsdal of Oslo-based Maipo Film was the producer, along with co-producers Teun Hilte of London-based The Apocalypse Films Company Ltd. and Rita Dagher of Paris-based Senorita Films.[7]\n\nFilming began in April 2013. In a change of setting from the original Sweden of the play, the film was shot at Castle Coole, a late 18th-century country mansion in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.[8] Filming lasted for five weeks.[9] For Farrell, John was one of the hardest roles in his career due to the source material's \"sustained cruelty and trauma\".[9]\n\n## Reception\n\nAs of January 2024, Miss Julie has an approval rating of 53% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 55 reviews, and an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Miss Julie definitely gives Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell room to shine, but neglects to leave them a solid enough setting to augment their efforts\".[10] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[11]\n\nDennis Harvey of Variety criticised Ullmann as a director for keeping the film too \"static\", \"airless\", and tied to the stage play.[7][12][13] Film Journal International noted several issues with the directing, such as the \"unnecessary and squishy soft-focus flashbacks\" and the \"tacky shock effect\" of the bird's death. It claimed the incorporation of classical music dipped the experience in \"aural 'class' that is merely more distancing for the viewer\", and that the overuse of close-up shots led the source material to not \"breathe and bloom of its own dramatic accord\".[12] Richard Ouzounian criticised the pacing as \"just a bit too stately for words\".[14]\n\nThe film's three stars were acclaimed for their performances.[7][15][13] As Tara Brady of The Irish Times described, \"Chastain is as brittle and fragile a Miss Julie as ever there was. Her dark eye circles on near translucent skin convey a damaged flightiness and breakability before she utters a single plummy vowel.\"[15] A detractor of Chastain's performance was Ouzounian, who found it \"too relentlessly contemporary\" and having \"a passion that you just know is going to end badly\".[14]\n\nBrady praised the choice of filming location, Castle Coole, \"an impeccable neo-classical building, that lends an aura of airlessness and artefact to a work that finds these same flaws in the social order.\"[15]\n\nBrady and RogerEbert.com's Sheila O'Malley highlighted the cinematography, particularly how it emphasized the closeness of the rooms.[15][13] Explained O'Mailey, \"The claustrophobia of the kitchen is overwhelming in the film, and the shots of Miss Julie wandering through the manor by herself, her posture broken and stiff, her dress falling off her shoulder, give us a welcome (and yet rivetingly disturbing) change of scene.\"[13]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Driscoll, Amanda. \"Colin Farrell, Jessica Chastain to shoot period movie 'Miss Julie' in Co.

The original Swedish title is Smultronstället, which literally means \"the wild strawberry patch\" but idiomatically signifies a hidden gem of a place, often with personal or sentimental value, and not widely known. The cast includes Victor Sjöström in his final screen performance as an old man recalling his past, as well as Bergman regulars Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand. Max von Sydow and Gunnel Lindblom also appear in small roles.\n\nBergman wrote the screenplay while hospitalized.[1] Exploring philosophical themes such as introspection and human existence, Wild Strawberries received wide positive domestic reception upon release, and won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival. It is often considered to be one of Bergman's best films, as well as one of the greatest films ever made.[2]\n\n## Plot\n\nGrouchy, stubborn, and egotistical Professor Isak Borg is a widowed 78-year-old physician who specialized in bacteriology. Before specializing, he served as a general practitioner in rural Sweden. He sets out on a long car ride from Stockholm to Lund to be awarded the degree of Doctor Jubilaris 50 years after he received his doctorate from Lund University. He is accompanied by his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne who does not much like her father-in-law and is planning to separate from her husband, Evald, Isak's only son. Evald does not want her to have the baby, their first.\n\nDuring the trip, Isak is forced by nightmares, daydreams, old age, and impending death to reevaluate his life. He meets a series of hitchhikers, each of whom sets off dreams or reveries into Borg's troubled past. The first group consists of two young men and their companion, a woman named Sara who is adored by both men. Sara is a double for the love of Isak's youth. He reminisces about his childhood at the seaside and his sweetheart Sara, with whom he remembered gathering strawberries, but who instead married his brother. The first group remains with him throughout his journey. Next Isak and Marianne pick up an embittered middle-aged couple, the Almans, whose vehicle had nearly collided with theirs. The pair exchanges such terrible vitriol and venom that Marianne stops the car and demands that they leave. The couple reminds Isak of his own unhappy marriage. In a dream sequence, Isak is asked by Sten Alman, now the examiner, to read \"foreign\" letters on the blackboard. He cannot. So, Alman reads it for him: \"A doctor's first duty is to ask forgiveness,\" from which he concludes, \"You are guilty of guilt.\"[3]\n\nHe is confronted by his loneliness and aloofness, recognizing these traits in both his elderly mother (whom they stop to visit) and in his middle-aged physician son, and he gradually begins to accept himself, his past, his present, and his approaching death.[4][5][6]\n\nBorg finally arrives at his destination and is promoted to Doctor Jubilaris, but this proves to be an empty ritual. That night, he bids a loving goodbye to his young friends, to whom the once bitter old man whispers in response to a playful declaration of the young girl's love, \"I'll remember.\" As he goes to his bed in his son's home, he is overcome by a sense of peace, and dreams of a family picnic by a lake. Closure and affirmation of life have finally come, and Borg's face radiates joy.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Victor Sjöström as Professor Isak Borg\n- Bibi Andersson as Sara (both: Isak's cousin/hitchhiker)\n- Ingrid Thulin as Marianne Borg\n- Gunnar Björnstrand as Evald Borg\n- Jullan Kindahl as Agda, Isak's housekeeper\n- Folke Sundquist as Anders, hitchhiker\n- Björn Bjelfvenstam as Viktor, hitchhiker\n- Naima Wifstrand as Isak's Mother\n- Gunnel Broström as Berit Alman, angry wife\n- Gunnar Sjöberg as Sten Alman, angry husband / The Examiner\n- Max von Sydow as Henrik Åkerman, gas station attendant\n- Ann-Marie Wiman as Eva Åkerman\n- Gertrud Fridh as Karin Borg, Isak's wife\n- Åke Fridell as Karin's lover\n- Sif Ruud as Aunt Olga\n- Yngve Nordwall as Uncle Aron\n- Per Sjöstrand as Sigfrid Borg\n- Gio Petré as Sigbritt Borg\n- Gunnel Lindblom as Charlotta Borg\n- Maud Hansson as Angelica Borg\n- Eva Norée as Anna Borg\n- Göran Lundquist as Benjamin Borg\n- Per Skogsberg as Hagbart Borg\n- Lena Bergman as Kristina Borg, twin\n- Monica Ehrling as Birgitta Borg, twin\n\n## Production\n\n### Origins\n\nIngmar Bergman (L) and Victor Sjöström (R) in 1957, during production of Wild Strawberries in the studios in Solna.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBergman's idea for the film originated on a drive from Stockholm to Dalarna during which he stopped in Uppsala, his hometown. Driving by his grandmother's house, he suddenly imagined how it would be if he could open the door and inside find everything just as it was during his childhood. \"So it struck me — what if you could make a film about this; that you just walk up in a realistic way and open a door, and then you walk into your childhood, and then you open another door and come back to reality, and then you make a turn around a street corner and arrive in some other period of your existence, and everything goes on, lives. That was actually the idea behind Wild Strawberries\".[7][page needed] Later, he would revise the story of the film's genesis. In Images: My Life in Film, he comments on his own earlier statement: \"That's a lie. The truth is that I am forever living in my childhood.\"[8]: p22\n\n### Development\n\nBergman wrote the screenplay of Wild Strawberries in Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital (the workplace of Isak Borg) in the late spring of 1957; he'd recently been given permission to proceed by producer Carl Anders Dymling on the basis of a short synopsis. He was in the hospital for two months, being treated for recurrent gastric problems and general stress. Bergman's doctor at Karolinska was his good friend Sture Helander who invited him to attend his lectures on psychosomatics. Helander was married to Gunnel Lindblom who was to play Isak's sister Charlotta in the film. Bergman was at a high point of his professional career after a triumphant season at the Malmö City Theatre (where he had been artistic director since 1952), in addition to the success of both Smiles of a Summer Night (1955) and The Seventh Seal (1957). His private life, however, was in disarray. His third marriage was on the rocks; his affair with Bibi Andersson, which had begun in 1954, was coming to an end; and his relationship with his parents was, after an attempted reconciliation with his mother, at a desperately low ebb.[8]: p17\n\nCasting and pre-production progressed rapidly. The completed screenplay is dated 31 May. Shooting took place between 2 July 1957 and 27 August 1957.[9] The scenes at the summer house were filmed in Saltsjöbaden, a fashionable resort in the Stockholm archipelago. Part of the nightmare sequence was shot with predawn summer light in Gamla stan, the old part of central Stockholm. Most of the movie was made at SF's studio and on its back lot at Råsunda in northern Stockholm.[1]\n\n### Casting\n\nThe director's immediate choice for the leading role of the old professor was Victor Sjöström, Bergman's silent film idol and early counselor at Svensk Filmindustri, whom he had directed in To Joy eight years earlier. \"Victor,\" Bergman remarked, \"was feeling wretched and didn't want to [do it];... he must have been seventy eight. He was misanthropic and tired and felt old. I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get him to play the part.\"[10]\n\nIn Bergman on Bergman, he has stated that he only thought of Sjöström when the screenplay was complete, and that he asked Dymling to contact the famous actor and film director.[11] Yet in Images: My Life in Film, he claims, \"It is probably worth noting that I never for a moment thought of Sjöström when I was writing the screenplay. The suggestion came from the film's producer, Carl Anders Dymling. As I recall, I thought long and hard before I agreed to let him have the part.\"[8]: p24\n\nDuring the shooting, the health of the 78-year-old Sjöström gave cause for concern. Dymling had persuaded him to take on the role with the words: \"All you have to do is lie under a tree, eat wild strawberries and think about your past, so it's nothing too arduous.\" This was inaccurate and the burden of the film was completely on Sjöström who is in all but one scene of the film. Initially, Sjöström had problems with his lines which made him frustrated and angry. He would go off into a corner and beat his head against the wall in frustration, even to the point of drawing blood and producing bruises. He sometimes quibbled over details in the script. To unburden his revered mentor, Bergman made a pact with Ingrid Thulin that if anything went wrong during a scene, she would take the blame on herself. Things improved when they changed filming times so that Sjöström could get home in time for his customary late afternoon whisky at 5:00. Sjöström got along particularly well with Bibi Andersson.[1]\n\nAs usual, Bergman chose his collaborators from a team of actors and technicians with whom he had worked before in the cinema and the theater. As Sara, Bibi Andersson plays both Borg's childhood sweetheart who left him to marry his brother and a charming, energetic young woman who reminds him of that lost love. Andersson, then twenty one years old, was a member in Bergman's famed repertory company. He gave her a small part in his films Smiles of a Summer Night (1955) and as the jester's wife in The Seventh Seal (1957). She would continue to work for him in many more films, most notably in Persona (1966). Ingrid Thulin plays Marianne, the sad, gentle and warm daughter-in-law of Borg. She appeared in other Bergman films as the mistress in Winter Light (1963) and as one of three sisters in Cries and Whispers (1972).\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nWild Strawberries received strongly positive reviews in Sweden; its acting, script, and photography were common areas of praise.[12] It was among the films that cemented Bergman's international reputation,[13] but American critics were not unanimous in their praise. A number of reviewers found its story puzzling. In The New York Times, Bosley Crowther lauded the performances of Sjöström and Andersson but wrote, \"This one is so thoroughly mystifying that we wonder whether Mr. Bergman himself knew what he was trying to say.\"[14] The film ranked 7th on Cahiers du Cinéma's Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1959.[15]\n\nIn a 1963 interview with Cinema magazine, director Stanley Kubrick listed the film as his second favourite of all time.[16] It was also listed by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky as one of his top ten favorite films.[17] It is now considered one of Bergman's major works. Film critic Derek Malcolm ranked the film at No. 56 on his list of the \"Top 100 Movies\" in 2001.[18] In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 34 by The Guardian's readers poll on the list of \"40 greatest foreign films of all time\".[19] In 2009, the film was ranked at No. 59 on Japanese film magazine kinema Junpo's Top 100 Non-Japanese Films of All Time list.[20]\n\nIn 1972, the work was ranked 10th, in 2002 it was ranked 27th,[21] and in 2012, it ranked 63rd on the Sight &amp; Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.[22] That same year the film was voted at number 11 on the 25 best Swedish films of all time list by a poll of 50 film critics and academics conducted by film magazine FLM.[23] Its screenplay was listed in Total Film as one of the 50 best ever written.[24] The film was included in BBC's 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films.[25] In 2022 edition of Sight &amp; Sound's Greatest films of all time list the film ranked 72nd in the director's poll.[26]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Wild Strawberries has an approval rating of 96% based on 45 reviews, with an average score of 8.90/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Wild Strawberries were never so bittersweet as Ingmar Bergman's beautifully written and filmed look at one man's nostalgic journey into the past.\"[27] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 17 critic's reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[28]\n\nThe philosopher Roger Scruton wrote of the film: \"Even now, after ten viewings, I want to see Wild Strawberries again, not for the story only, but for specific snatches of dialogue, specific images and the specific atmosphere which makes this film enter the soul with the evocative force of a play by Ibsen or Strindberg.\"[29]\n\n### Awards and honors\n\nThe film won the Golden Bear for Best Film and the FIPRESCI Prize[30] at the 8th Berlin International Film Festival,[31] \"Best Film\" and \"Best Actor\" at the Mar del Plata Film Festival and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film in 1960. The Film was nominated for a BAFTA Award in Best Film From Any Source category in 1959. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Original Screenplay, but the nomination was refused by Bergman.[32] In his letter to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Bergman wrote, \"I have found that the \"Oscar\" nomination is one for the motion picture art humiliating institution and ask you to be released from the attention of the jury for the future.\"[33] The film won the Pasinetti Award at 1958 Venice Film Festival. It won the Bodil Award for Best European Film in 1959.[34]\n\nThe film is included on the Vatican's list of important films, recommended for its portrayal of a man's \"interior journey from pangs of regret and anxiety to a refreshing sense of peace and reconciliation\".[35]\n\n## Influence\n\nWild Strawberries influenced the Woody Allen films Stardust Memories (1980), Another Woman (1988), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), and Deconstructing Harry (1997). In Stardust Memories, the film's plot is similar in that the protagonist, filmmaker Sandy Bates (Woody Allen), is attending a viewing of his films, while reminiscing about and reflecting on his life and past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize his current ones, which are infused with flashbacks and dream sequences.  In Another Woman, the film's main character, Marion Post (Gena Rowlands), is also accused by friends and relatives of being cold and unfeeling, which forces her to reexamine her life.[36]  Allen also borrows several tropes from Bergman's film, such as having Lynn (Frances Conroy), Post's sister-in-law, tell her that her brother Paul (Harris Yulin) hates her and having a former student tell Post that her class changed her life. Allen has Post confront the demons of her past via several dream sequences and flashbacks that reveal important information to a viewer, as in Wild Strawberries.  In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen made reference to the scene in which Isak watches his family have dinner.[37]  In Deconstructing Harry, the plot (a writer going on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university, while reflecting upon his life's experiences, with dream sequences) essentially mirrors that of Wild Strawberries.[38]\n\nSatyajit Ray's 1966 film Nayak was to some extent inspired by Wild Strawberries.[39]\n\nYugoslav hard rock and heavy metal band Divlje Jagode (Serbo-Croatian for Wild Strawberries) chose their name after the film.[40] During their short-lived international career, the band adopted the name Wild Strawberries.[41]\n\n## Attempted American remake\n\nScreenwriter Bo Goldman sought to remake the film in 1995 as his directorial debut. Gregory Peck would have starred in the titular role of the elderly professor.[42] Despite the support of Martin Scorsese, who agreed to produce, the film was not green lit.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Wild Strawberries\".

The story bears some similarities to Widerberg's own background, although he claimed it to be entirely fictional.[1]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Anders dreams of becoming a writer. His friend Sixten dreams of becoming a football player so he can go to Paris and meet prostitutes in fur. Anders' ambitions are supported by his girlfriend, Elsie, and his parents. His mother supports the family by doing laundry, while his father, who is unemployed, struggles with alcohol and gambling.\n\nAnders sends a manuscript for a book he has written about the block they live in to a publisher in Stockholm. He is asked to come to Stockholm and discuss the book, which excites his father. However, the publisher declines to publish the book, and when Anders returns, they all become very disappointed.\n\nElsie becomes pregnant with Anders' child. Anders seeks advice from his father, but his father is drunk, and they end up fighting. The father blames his wife for all the misery they are suffering, attributing it to an affair she once had. The mother blames the father, believing his violent behavior led to her infidelity.\n\nAnders decides to leave his family, his pregnant girlfriend, and all the misery behind. He joins Sixten, and they both travel to Stockholm.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Thommy Berggren as Anders\n- Keve Hjelm as His Father\n- Emy Storm as His Mother\n- Christina Frambäck as Elsie\n- Ingvar Hirdwall as Sixten\n- Agneta Prytz as Neighbour\n- Fritiof Nilsson Piraten as himself\n- Nina Widerberg as Nina\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was shot on location in a run-down Malmö block that was soon to be demolished. Locals were used as extras to strengthen the feeling of authenticity.[2]\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\nAt the 1st Guldbagge Awards Keve Hjelm was awarded the Guldbagge for Best Actor.[3] The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.[4] It was also entered into the official selection at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival, competing for the Palme d'Or.[5]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of submissions to the 37th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n- List of Swedish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Häglund, Kjell (September 1995) \"Kjell möter Bo Widerberg.\" (in Swedish) Café Magazine.

It is a companion film to 1968's I Am Curious (Blue); the two were initially intended to be one 3+1⁄2 hour film.[1]\n\n## Plot\n\nDirector Vilgot Sjöman plans to make a social film starring his lover (played by Lena Nyman), a young theatre student who has a strong interest in social issues.\n\nNyman's character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in Stockholm and is driven by a burning passion for social justice and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as \"religion\" and \"men\", and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of concentration camps and a portrait of Francisco Franco, reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco's Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena's relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco as part of the International Brigades, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period.\n\nThrough her father Lena meets the slick Bill (Börje in the original Swedish), who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic life-style, meditating, studying nonviolence and practicing yoga. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shotgun, but they soon make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of soccer players – she notes that they number 23 – to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally Martin Luther King Jr. drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice nonviolence.\n\nLena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has scabies. They are treated at a clinic, and then go their separate ways. As the embedded story of Lena and Bill begins to resolve, the film crew and director Sjöman are featured more. The relationship between Lena the actress and Bill the actor has become intimate during the production of Vilgot's film, and Vilgot is jealous and clashes with Bill. The film concludes with Lena returning Vilgot's keys as he meets with another young female theatre student.\n\n### Nonfictional content\n\nThe film includes an interview with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., filmed in March 1966, when King was visiting Stockholm along with Harry Belafonte with a view to starting a new initiative for Swedish support of African Americans.[2] The film also includes an interview with the Minister of Transportation, Olof Palme (later Prime Minister of Sweden), who talks about the existence of class structure in Swedish society (he was told it was for a documentary film), and footage of the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko.\n\n## Cast\n\n## Release\n\nDirector Vilgot Sjöman together with actress Lena Nyman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Censorship\n\nThe film includes numerous and frank scenes of nudity and staged sexual intercourse. One particularly controversial scene features Lena kissing her lover's (Borje's) flaccid penis. Released in Sweden in October 1967, it was released in the U.S. in March 1969, immediately attracting a ban in Massachusetts for being pornographic, with the Boston Police Department seizing the film reels from the Symphony Cinemas I &amp; II on Huntington Avenue.[3][4] After proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Karalexis v. Byrne, 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969)), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States (Byrne v. Karalexis, 396 U.S. 976 (1969) and 401 U.S. 216 (1971)), the Second Circuit found the film not to be obscene.[5][4][6]\n\nThe Maryland film censorship board banned the film's exhibition in the state on 8 July 1969, in a decision backed by Francis B. Burch, who was the state's attorney general at the time; he described the film as hard-core pornography.[7] The ruling was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union,[8] and although an appeals court eventually declared that the film was not obscene,[9] the ban was ultimately upheld with a split 4-3 vote.[10] On 3 December 1969, in response to the ruling, the film's American importer, Grove Press, took the case for distributing the film in all states to the US Supreme Court,[11] sparking a legal battle that spanned three years, ultimately ending in 1972, when Grove Press agreed to remove a minute and a half from the film for its Maryland showing.[12]\n\nAn arsonist set a fire in the Heights Theatre in Houston during the film's run there.[13] In April 1970, sheriff's deputies in Pensacola, Florida, seized prints of I Am Curious (Yellow), as well as Dracula (The Dirty Old Man), from the Ritz Theatre on N Tarragona St; the theater's manager was charged with \"two counts of unlawful showing of an obscene film and maintaining a public nuisance\".[14]\n\nThe film opened at the Vogue Art Theater in Denver, Colorado on 8 August 1969; hours after it opened there, it was seized by District Attorney Mike McKevitt, who promptly banned the film from being shown in the city, due to it violating a then-new obscenity law that was passed in the state; McKevitt had complained to District Judge Edward J. Byrne that the film was \"obscene and pornographic\".[15] The film's ban was challenged by its US importers, who succeeded in getting attorney Edward H. Sherman to return the film on 13 August 1969.[16] On 21 August 1969, Byrne labelled the ban an act of censorship and a \"prior restraint on the defendants' right to freedom of speech\"; subsequent to this, he lifted the ban on the film.[17] The film reopened at the Vogue Art on 22 August 1969, with 400 customers being reported as being in attendance.[18]\n\nAmong other Scandinavian nations, it was allowed uncut in Denmark, but was banned from being played in Norway due to its heavy sexual content.[19][20]\n\nThe film was censored by as much as 49 seconds in Australia between 1970 and 1971.[21] In the United Kingdom, John Trevelyan, a secretary of the British Board of Film Censors trimmed the film by eight minutes, reducing its running time to 114 minutes.[22][23] The Irish Film Censor's Office made two cuts to the film before its premiere in Ireland in 1973.[24]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was popular at the box office and was the 12th most popular film in the United States and Canada in 1969[25] and the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the United States and Canada of all-time[26] with a gross of $20,238,100.[27] It was number one at the US box office for two weeks in November 1969.[28] One reason it did so well was that it became popular among film stars to be seen going to the film. News of Johnny Carson seeing the film legitimized going to see it despite any misgivings about possible pornographic content.[29] Jacqueline Onassis went to see the movie, judo-felling an awaiting news photographer, Mel Finkelstein, alerted by the theatre manager, while leaving the theatre during the showing.[30][31][32]\n\n### Critical reception\n\n#### Contemporary\n\nInitial reception to Curious Yellow was divided. Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to it as a \"Good, serious movie about a society in transition\",[33] and Norman Mailer said he felt \"like a better man\" after having seen it. Conversely, Rex Reed described the film as \"about as good for you as drinking furniture polish\" and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times lambasted it as \"a dog... a real dog\" and \"stupid and slow and uninteresting\".[34] Rex Reed said the movie was \"vile and disgusting\" and Sjöman was \"a very sick Swede with an overwhelming ego and a fondness for photographing pubic hair\",[35] but Norman Mailer described it as \"one of the most important pictures I have ever seen in my life\".[36]\n\nIn the UK, Patrick Gibbs of The Daily Telegraph wrote that \"there's not much for patrons in this cinema-verite material, presented in the Godard style as if it were holy writ.\"[37] Penelope Mortimer of The Observer wrote that \"it is publicised as being very sexy. I have no more to say about it, except that that is a lie.\"[38] Alexander Walker of the Evening Standard remarked that as a result of having been cut in the UK, it \"will now never satisfy the curiosity of people who know it as the first Swedish film to show the sex act. Every scene of that kind has been severely 'reduced' by our censor and we are left with a dull film of almost parochial impact about a girl public opinion-tester endlessly asking Swedes their views of class, colour, war and pacificism—oddly enough, not sex, unless you take a protest poster that reads 'COLOURED PEOPLE BE PREPARED—THE WHITES ARE STAGGERING' to fall into that category.\"[39]\n\n#### Retrospective\n\nIn 1974, when an uncut version of the film debuted in Australia, critic Colin Bennett of The Age remarked that \"almost the only fascination now lies in the revelation of what was considered far too notorious to be imported into [Australia] a few short years ago\", adding that \"sociologically, this satirical stuff may have had more point in 1967 Sweden, and I suppose it does reveal a modicum about Scandinavian social attitudes. It is also peculiarly dated. [...] One finds oneself no longer curious.\"[40]\n\nIn recent years, Yellow has received some reappraisal, thanks in part to Gary Giddins, who authored the 2003 essay accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, and a review by Nathan Southern on the All Movie Guide website. Southern assesses the picture as \"a droll and sophisticated comedy about the emotional, political, social, and sexual liberation of a young woman... a real original that has suffered from public incomprehension since its release and is crying out for reassessment and rediscovery\".[41]\n\nAs of August 2015, I Am Curious (Yellow) received a 52% rating based on 25 reviews, 13 \"fresh\" and 12 \"rotten\" on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nOlof Palme (who played himself in an uncredited role in the movie) and Lena Nyman, taken at the Guldbagge Award ceremony. Nyman won the 1967 award for Best Actress in a leading role.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Awards and honors\n\nNyman won the award for Best Actress at the 5th Guldbagge Awards for her role in this film and I Am Curious (Blue).[42]\n\n## In popular culture\n\nVarious television series have episodes with similar titles, such as Get Smart's series finale \"I Am Curiously Yellow\"; Moonlighting (\"I Am Curious, Maddie\"); The Simpsons (\"I Am Furious (Yellow)\"); That Girl (\"I Am Curious Lemon\"); Ed, Edd n Eddy (\"I Am Curious Ed\"); and The Partridge Family (\"I Am Curious...Partridge\").\n\nAdditionally, an issue of Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, named \"I Am Curious (Black)\", focuses on Lois Lane, who becomes a black woman for a day to experience racism.[43]\n\nIn the Mad Men seventh season episode \"The Strategy\", Don Draper references having just seen this movie in a theatre.[44]\n\nEpisode 285 of This American Life featured a story called \"I Am Curious, Jello,\" which followed up on the censorship trial between Los Angeles prosecutor Michael Guarino and Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra two decades after the case was thrown out of court.[45]\n\nAmerican car manufacturer Plymouth introduced a special order color for 1971. \"Curious Yellow\" is a vibrant greenish yellow, one of their \"High-Impact\" colors.[46]\n\nThe eleventh studio album by the English post-punk band The Fall makes reference to the film in its title, I Am Kurious Oranj.[47]\n\nIt made a question in Trivial Pursuit: \"What Swedish sex film caused a stir in 1967?\" Answer: I am Curious (Yellow).\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Vilgot Sjöman, I Was Curious: Diary of the Making of a Film (Grove Press, 1968).\n- ^ Sjöman, published scenario (New York: Grove Press, 1968, 264 p., 266 stills from the film; translated from the Swedish by Martin Minow and Jenny Bohman).\n- ^ \"Symphony Cinema I &amp;amp; II in Boston, MA\".

When the Supreme Court finally allowed the film to be released, it benefited considerably from the publicity. But cinema-goers seeking titillation were generally disappointed. The sex scenes were more surprising than erotic and were dominated by the rather vague narrative in which the actors (Lena Nyman, Borje Ahlstedt and Sjöman himself) all played characters with their own names.  But it marked a turning point for censorship, and by the 1970s a naked woman or a bare male bottom in a mainstream film barely raised an eyebrow.\n- ^ Gibbs, Patrick (7 March 1969). \"Legend without the spell\".

It and its 1972 sequel, The New Land (Nybyggarna), which were produced concurrently, are based on Vilhelm Moberg's The Emigrants, a series of novels about poor Swedes who emigrate from Småland, Sweden, in the mid-19th century and make their home in Minnesota. This film adapts the first two of the four novels (The Emigrants (1949) and Unto a Good Land (1952)), which depict the hardships the emigrants experience in Sweden and on their journey to America.\n\nThe Emigrants won international acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards. It was nominated for four more Oscars the following year, including for Best Picture, the same year that The New Land was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. The 1974 American television series The New Land is loosely based on both The Emigrants and its sequel.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1844, the Nilsson family lives on a small farm in Korpamoen in Ljuder Parish in the Swedish province of Småland. Eldest son, Karl Oskar, runs the farm after his father, Nils, is injured. Karl Oskar marries Kristina Johansdotter. In the following years, Karl Oskar and Kristina have four children, Anna, Johan, Märta and Harald. The family struggles with rock-filled fields, poor weather, and bad harvests, leaving them hungry and in debt. Kristina rebukes Karl Oskar for his irreligious attitude, partially blaming it for causing their problems.\n\nKarl Oskar's daydreaming and bookish younger brother, Robert, tired of being overworked and regularly beaten as an indentured farmhand at Aron's farm, reads about how wonderful America is and decides to emigrate. He asks Arvid, his fellow farmhand, to come with him. Arvid agrees, but their hopes are dashed upon realizing they are unable to afford passage. Robert wants to sell his share of the family farm to Karl Oskar, only to learn that Karl Oskar has also considered going to America. Despite the potential for a better life, Kristina is unenthusiastic, not wanting to leave her homeland and concerns about the arduous journey. However, when daughter Anna dies after gorging on uncooked porridge that ruptures her stomach, a devastated Kristina agrees to Karl Oskar's plan to leave Sweden.\n\nMeanwhile, Danjel Andreasson, Kristina's uncle, is being persecuted by Brusander, the local provost, for rejecting the official religion and holding fundamentalist religious services at his home. He and his wife, Inga-Lena, and their four young children are exiled, so they join Karl Oskar in his move to America. Ulrika of Västergöhl, a former prostitute who is one of Danjel's followers, and her illegitimate sixteen-year-old daughter, Elin, also join them, and Jonas Petter, a neighbor, is interested to escape his unhappy marriage. Robert is able to persuade Danjel to hire Arvid and pay his fare. Before their departure, Kristina tells Karl Oskar she is pregnant.\n\nThe emigrants travel to Karlshamn and board the wooden brig Charlotta, bound for New York City. On board, Karl Oskar and Kristina meet Måns and Fina-Kajsa Andersson, an elderly couple heading for the Minnesota Territory to settle on their son Anders' farm near a town called Taylor's Falls. After hearing how good the land is there, Karl Oskar and Kristina decide to follow them. During the voyage, Inga-Lena and Måns Andersson die of unrelated sudden illnesses, and Kristina nearly dies from a severe nosebleed.\n\nUpon arrival in New York, Karl Oskar and his party, along with Fina-Kajsa, travel westward to Minnesota, first by train, and then by riverboat. Throughout the whole journey from Sweden, the pious Kristina has been prejudiced against Ulrika for her past immorality, but they reconcile after Ulrika finds Kristina's missing child at a riverboat stop and was almost left behind. Soon after, while still on the riverboat, Danjel's infant daughter dies after a brief illness.\n\nAfter finally arriving at the town of Stillwater, the party, with help from Pastor Jackson, a friendly Baptist minister, finds their way to Anders' farm in what is now known as the Chisago Lakes area. He lives in a wooden shack, but the land is fertile, and Danjel and Jonas Petter choose fine farmland tracts nearby. Karl Oskar, however, heads deep into the woods to explore the lands along the shore of Lake Ki Chi Saga that he hears are even better. Upon arrival, he finds the topsoil is excellent and stakes a claim by carving his name into a tree overlooking the lake.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Max von Sydow as Karl Oskar Nilsson\n- Liv Ullmann as Kristina Nilsson\n- Eddie Axberg as Robert Nilsson\n- Sven-Olof Bern as Nils, Karl Oskar and Robert's father\n- Aina Alfredsson as Märta, Karl Oskar and Robert's mother\n- Allan Edwall as Danjel Andreasson, Kristina's uncle\n- Monica Zetterlund as Ulrika\n- Pierre Lindstedt as Arvid\n- Hans Alfredson as Jonas Petter\n- Ulla Smidje as Inga-Lena Andreasson, Danjel's wife\n- Eva-Lena Zetterlund as Elin, Ulrika's daughter\n- Gustaf Färingborg as Brusander, the provost\n- Åke Fridell as Aron\n- Agneta Prytz as Fina-Kajsa\n- Halvar Björk as Anders Månsson, Måns and Fina-Kajsa's son\n- Arnold Alfredsson as Verger\n- Bror Englund as Måns Jakob\n- Tom C.

Its author, Vilhelm Moberg, had seen Jan Troell's film Here Is Your Life before producer Bengt Forslund approached him about an Emigrants film. SF Studios wished to adapt all four novels, although it was uncertain how such a film structure would work.[1]\n\nMoberg requested Forslund and Troell meet him, and the three men mapped out a plot, with 98 scenes, finishing in March 1968. They also envisioned Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann and Eddie Axberg as the ideal stars.[1] Troell and Forslund went location scouting in the United States in September 1968, but found many of the lands were too developed or could not accommodate film equipment.[2]\n\n### Filming\n\nLake Krageholm was a filming location.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe scenes set in Chisago Lakes were actually filmed at Lake Krageholm in Scania, Sweden. Filming took place from June 1969 to January 1970, and then from May to August 1970.[2]\n\nUllmann said that for The Emigrants and The New Land, which were shot at the same time, the actors had to learn historic methods of laundry, and also that the brief scene in The Emigrants where she is on a swing took two days to film.[3]\n\nThe film employed 20 actors and 500 extras. The combined cost of the two films was kr 7 million, making them, at the time, the most expensive Swedish film yet produced.[2]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Emigrants was released to cinemas in Sweden on 8 March 1971.[4] It opened in New York City on 24 September 1972.[5] The version released in the U.S. was cut from 190 to 150 minutes by Warner Bros., who distributed the film in America.[6]\n\nIn the U.S., the film was not released on home video until February 2016, when The Criterion Collection released it, along with The New Land, on DVD and Blu-ray. The films had been frequently requested by customers.[7] In 2016, The Emigrants was also featured in the Gothenburg Film Festival.[8]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews.[9]\nThe Emigrants has an approval rating of 94% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10.[10]\nRoger Ebert gave it four stars, praising it as a \"masterpiece\", \"infinitely absorbing and moving\", and likely more accurate than traditional stories about immigration to the United States.[11] Richard Schickel wrote in Life that \"Jan Troell has made the masterpiece about the dream that shaped America - a dream, and an America, fast disappearing from our views\".[12] Vincent Canby of The New York Times hailed the acting performances, especially from von Sydow and Ullmann, which he found to hold \"a kind of spontaneous truth, in look and gesture, that does a lot to relieve the otherwise programed nobility, truth and beauty\". However, Canby criticized Troell for excessive views of \"sunlight-reflected-in-water that becomes just one too many, a thing of movie decoration\".[5] In New York, Judith Crist praised the film as \"exquisite\",[13] and wrote that the depiction of history \"throbs with flesh and blood\".[14] In 5001 Nights at the Movies, Pauline Kael declared the film is \"A bursting, resonant work\".[6]\n\nIn his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it \"Solid if rambling\".[15] Dave Kehr recalled it as overrated, calling it \"Uncommitted, tedious, and often dishonest\".[16] In 2016, the Swedish journal Sydsvenskan recalled The Emigrants as a classic.[8]\n\nImmigration historian Roger Daniels has called the film \"outstanding,\" as well as \"arguably the finest social history in a commercial movie.\"[17]\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe Emigrants was nominated for five Academy Awards, including for both Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture. However, the Academy's rules for eligibility for specific awards meant the nominations occurred in two separate years.[18] It was the third film not in English to be nominated for Best Picture in the history of the Academy.[19]\n\n| Award                        | Date of ceremony    | Category                                 | Recipient(s)                   | Result    | Ref(s)    |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards               | 10 April 1972       | Best Foreign Language Film               | Jan Troell                     | Nominated | [20]      |\n| Academy Awards               | 27 March 1973       | Best Picture                             | Bengt Forslund                 | Nominated | [21]      |\n| Academy Awards               | 27 March 1973       | Best Director                            | Jan Troell                     | Nominated | [21]      |\n| Academy Awards               | 27 March 1973       | Best Actress in a Leading Role           | Liv Ullmann                    | Nominated | [21]      |\n| Academy Awards               | 27 March 1973       | Best Adapted Screenplay                  | Jan Troell and Bengt Forslund  | Nominated | [21]      |\n| Golden Globe Awards          | 28 January 1973     | Best Foreign Language Film               | The Emigrants and The New Land | Won       | [22]      |\n| Golden Globe Awards          | 28 January 1973     | Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama | Liv Ullmann                    | Won       | [22]      |\n| Guldbagge Awards             | none                | Best Film                                | Utvandrarna                    | Won       | [23]      |\n| Guldbagge Awards             | 23 October 1972     | Best Actor                               | Eddie Axberg                   | Won       | [23]      |\n| National Board of Review     | 14 December 1972    | Top Foreign Films                        | The Emigrants                  | Won       | [24]      |\n| New York Film Critics Circle | 3 January 1973      | Best Actress                             | Liv Ullmann                    | Won       | [25]      |\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Emigrants helped make Jan Troell prominent internationally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe sequel, The New Land (Nybyggarna), was released in 1972. The 1974 U.S. television series The New Land is based loosely on both The Emigrants and its sequel.[26] The creation of the TV series can be attributed to the popularity of the films.[27] In Sweden, the musical Kristina från Duvemåla by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, formerly of ABBA fame, was designed partly in reaction to Troell's films, particularly in differences in the set.[28] Troell also gave his approval to Daniel Espinosa to make a new Emigrants film adaptation in 2015,[29] which was ultimately not produced. In 2021, an adaptation based on the book series was released, directed by Erik Poppe.[30]\n\nThe two films were considered to give Jan Troell his \"international breakthrough\".[31] They led to his receiving, and accepting, an offer from Warner Bros. to make Zandy's Bride, one of the first times a prominent Swedish director moved to Hollywood since the 1920s.[31]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of submissions to the 44th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n- List of Swedish submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n- List of foreign-language films nominated for Academy Awards\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b Wessell 1972, p. 15.\n- ^ a b c Wessell 1972, p. 16.\n- ^ Ullmann 2006, p. 6.\n- ^ \"Utvandrarna\" (in Swedish).

Eldest son, Karl Oskar, runs the farm after his father, Nils, is injured. Karl Oskar marries Kristina Johansdotter. In the following years, Karl Oskar and Kristina have four children, Anna, Johan, Märta and Harald. The family struggles with rock-filled fields, poor weather, and bad harvests, leaving them hungry and in debt. Kristina rebukes Karl Oskar for his irreligious attitude, partially blaming it for causing their problems. Karl Oskar's daydreaming and bookish younger brother, Robert, tired of being overworked and regularly beaten as an indentured farmhand at Aron's farm, reads about how wonderful America is and decides to emigrate. He asks Arvid, his fellow farmhand, to come with him. Arvid agrees, but their hopes are dashed upon realizing they are unable to afford passage. Robert wants to sell his share of the family farm to Karl Oskar, only to learn that Karl Oskar has also considered going to America. Despite the potential for a better life, Kristina is unenthusiastic, not wanting to leave her homeland and concerns about the arduous journey. However, when daughter Anna dies after gorging on uncooked porridge that ruptures her stomach, a devastated Kristina agrees to Karl Oskar's plan to leave Sweden. Meanwhile, Danjel Andreasson, Kristina's uncle, is being persecuted by Brusander, the local provost, for rejecting the official religion and holding fundamentalist religious services at his home. He and his wife, Inga-Lena, and their four young children are exiled, so they join Karl Oskar in his move to America. Ulrika of Västergöhl, a former prostitute who is one of Danjel's followers, and her illegitimate sixteen-year-old daughter, Elin, also join them, and Jonas Petter, a neighbor, is interested to escape his unhappy marriage. Robert is able to persuade Danjel to hire Arvid and pay his fare. Before their departure, Kristina tells Karl Oskar she is pregnant. The emigrants travel to Karlshamn and board the wooden brig Charlotta, bound for New York City. On board, Karl Oskar and Kristina meet Måns and Fina-Kajsa Andersson, an elderly couple heading for the Minnesota Territory to settle on their son Anders' farm near a town called Taylor's Falls. After hearing how good the land is there, Karl Oskar and Kristina decide to follow them. During the voyage, Inga-Lena and Måns Andersson die of unrelated sudden illnesses, and Kristina nearly dies from a severe nosebleed. Upon arrival in New York, Karl Oskar and his party, along with Fina-Kajsa, travel westward to Minnesota, first by train, and then by riverboat. Throughout the whole journey from Sweden, the pious Kristina has been prejudiced against Ulrika for her past immorality, but they reconcile after Ulrika finds Kristina's missing child at a riverboat stop and was almost left behind. Soon after, while still on the riverboat, Danjel's infant daughter dies after a brief illness. After finally arriving at the town of Stillwater, the party, with help from Pastor Jackson, a friendly Baptist minister, finds their way to Anders' farm in what is now known as the Chisago Lakes area. He lives in a wooden shack, but the land is fertile, and Danjel and Jonas Petter choose fine farmland tracts nearby. Karl Oskar, however, heads deep into the woods to explore the lands along the shore of Lake Ki Chi Saga that he hears are even better. Upon arrival, he finds the topsoil is excellent and stakes a claim by carving his name into a tree overlooking the lake.\",\n            \"Cast\": [\n                \"Max von Sydow as Karl Oskar Nilsson\",\n                \"Liv Ullmann as Kristina Nilsson\",\n                \"Eddie Axberg as Robert Nilsson\",\n                \"Sven-Olof Bern as Nils, Karl Oskar and Robert's father\",\n                \"Aina Alfredsson as Märta, Karl Oskar and Robert's mother\",\n                \"Allan Edwall as Danjel Andreasson, Kristina's uncle\",\n                \"Monica Zetterlund as Ulrika\",\n                \"Pierre Lindstedt as Arvid\",\n                \"Hans Alfredson as Jonas Petter\",\n                \"Ulla Smidje as Inga-Lena Andreasson, Danjel's wife\",\n                \"Eva-Lena Zetterlund as Elin, Ulrika's daughter\",\n                \"Gustaf Färingborg as Brusander, the provost\",\n                \"Åke Fridell as Aron\",\n                \"Agneta Prytz as Fina-Kajsa\",\n                \"Halvar Björk as Anders Månsson, Måns and Fina-Kajsa's son\",\n                \"Arnold Alfredsson as Verger\",\n                \"Bror Englund as Måns Jakob\",\n                \"Tom C.

Its author, Vilhelm Moberg, had seen Jan Troell's film Here Is Your Life before producer Bengt Forslund approached him about an Emigrants film. SF Studios wished to adapt all four novels, although it was uncertain how such a film structure would work. Moberg requested Forslund and Troell meet him, and the three men mapped out a plot, with 98 scenes, finishing in March 1968. They also envisioned Max von Sydow, Liv Ullmann and Eddie Axberg as the ideal stars. Troell and Forslund went location scouting in the United States in September 1968, but found many of the lands were too developed or could not accommodate film equipment.\",\n                \"Filming\": \"The scenes set in Chisago Lakes were actually filmed at Lake Krageholm in Scania, Sweden. Filming took place from June 1969 to January 1970, and then from May to August 1970. Ullmann said that for The Emigrants and The New Land, which were shot at the same time, the actors had to learn historic methods of laundry, and also that the brief scene in The Emigrants where she is on a swing took two days to film. The film employed 20 actors and 500 extras. The combined cost of the two films was kr 7 million, making them, at the time, the most expensive Swedish film yet produced.\"\n            },\n            \"Release\": {\n                \"Date\": \"The Emigrants was released to cinemas in Sweden on 8 March 1971.

In the U.S., the film was not released on home video until February 2016, when The Criterion Collection released it, along with The New Land, on DVD and Blu-ray. The films had been frequently requested by customers. In 2016, The Emigrants was also featured in the Gothenburg Film Festival.\"\n            },\n            \"Reception\": {\n                \"Critical\": \"The film received mostly positive reviews. The Emigrants has an approval rating of 94% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 17 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. Roger Ebert gave it four stars, praising it as a 'masterpiece', 'infinitely absorbing and moving', and likely more accurate than traditional stories about immigration to the United States. Richard Schickel wrote in Life that 'Jan Troell has made the masterpiece about the dream that shaped America - a dream, and an America, fast disappearing from our views'. Vincent Canby of The New York Times hailed the acting performances, especially from von Sydow and Ullmann, which he found to hold 'a kind of spontaneous truth, in look and gesture, that does a lot to relieve the otherwise programed nobility, truth and beauty'. However, Canby criticized Troell for excessive views of 'sunlight-reflected-in-water that becomes just one too many, a thing of movie decoration'. In New York, Judith Crist praised the film as 'exquisite', and wrote that the depiction of history 'throbs with flesh and blood'. In 5001 Nights at the Movies, Pauline Kael declared the film is 'A bursting, resonant work'. In his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it 'Solid if rambling'. Dave Kehr recalled it as overrated, calling it 'Uncommitted, tedious, and often dishonest'. In 2016, the Swedish journal Sydsvenskan recalled The Emigrants as a classic. Immigration historian Roger Daniels has called the film 'outstanding,' as well as 'arguably the finest social history in a commercial movie.'\",\n                \"Accolades\": [\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Academy Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"10 April 1972\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Foreign Language Film\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Jan Troell\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Nominated\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Academy Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"27 March 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Picture\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Bengt Forslund\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Nominated\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Academy Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"27 March 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Director\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Jan Troell\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Nominated\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Academy Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"27 March 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Liv Ullmann\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Nominated\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Academy Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"27 March 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Adapted Screenplay\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Jan Troell and Bengt Forslund\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Nominated\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Golden Globe Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"28 January 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Foreign Language Film\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"The Emigrants and The New Land\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Won\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Golden Globe Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"28 January 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Liv Ullmann\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Won\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Guldbagge Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"none\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Film\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Utvandrarna\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Won\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"Guldbagge Awards\",\n                        \"Date\": \"23 October 1972\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Actor\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Eddie Axberg\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Won\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"National Board of Review\",\n                        \"Date\": \"14 December 1972\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Top Foreign Films\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"The Emigrants\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Won\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Award\": \"New York Film Critics Circle\",\n                        \"Date\": \"3 January 1973\",\n                        \"Category\": \"Best Actress\",\n                        \"Recipient\": \"Liv Ullmann\",\n                        \"Result\": \"Won\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            \"Legacy\": \"The Emigrants helped make Jan Troell prominent internationally. The sequel, The New Land (Nybyggarna), was released in 1972. The 1974 U.S. television series The New Land is based loosely on both The Emigrants and its sequel. The creation of the TV series can be attributed to the popularity of the films. In Sweden, the musical Kristina från Duvemåla by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, formerly of ABBA fame, was designed partly in reaction to Troell's films, particularly in differences in the set. Troell also gave his approval to Daniel Espinosa to make a new Emigrants film adaptation in 2015, which was ultimately not produced. In 2021, an adaptation based on the book series was released, directed by Erik Poppe. The two films were considered to give Jan Troell his 'international breakthrough'. They led to his receiving, and accepting, an offer from Warner Bros. to make Zandy's Bride, one of the first times a prominent Swedish director moved to Hollywood since the 1920s.\"\n        }\n    </AdditionalInformation>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains coherent and informative while highlighting key details with XML tags.",

1998 Swedish romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson in his feature-length directorial debut. It stars Rebecka Liljeberg and Alexandra Dahlström as two seemingly disparate teenage girls who begin a tentative romantic relationship. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 23 October 1998,[2] and premiered internationally at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIt received an overwhelmingly positive reception[3] and won four Guldbagge Awards (Sweden's official film awards) at the 1999 ceremony. Its international awards include the Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival,[4] and the Special Jury Prize at the 34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 71st Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.\n\nThe Swedish title refers to the small town of Åmål in Västra Götaland County, western Sweden. However, only a few scenes were filmed in Åmål,[5] and they were not included in the final product. Primary filming took place in the nearby town of Trollhättan, the location of producing company Film i Väst's studios.[6][7]\n\n## Plot\n\nTwo girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of Åmål, Sweden. Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it.\n\nAgnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party.\n\nElin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes.\n\nAfter becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car.\n\nElin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school.\n\nThe film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying \"It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter\".\n\n## Cast\n\n- Alexandra Dahlström as Elin Olsson\n- Rebecka Liljeberg as Agnes Ahlberg\n- Erica Carlson as Jessica Olsson\n- Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth\n- Stefan Hörberg as Markus\n- Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria\n- Ralph Carlsson as Agnes's father, Olof\n- Maria Hedborg as Agnes's mother, Karin\n- Axel Widegren as Agnes's little brother, Oskar\n- Jill Ung as Elin's and Jessica's mother, Birgitta\n\n## Title\n\nThe original title of the film, Fucking Åmål, refers to the girls' feelings about their small town: In a key scene, Elin shouts in desperation \"varför måste vi bo i fucking jävla kuk-Åmål?\" (which roughly translates to \"why do we have to live in fucking bloody cock-Åmål?\").[8]\n\nAccording to Moodysson, the problem with the original title started when the film was Sweden's candidate for the Academy Awards, though eventually it was not chosen as a nominee.[9][10][11] The Hollywood industry magazine Variety refused to run an advertisement for Fucking Åmål. Thus, American distributor Strand Releasing asked for a new title. Moodysson took the new title from the song at the end of the film, by Robyn.[8] Distributors in other native English-speaking countries then followed suit.\n\n- German: Raus aus Åmål, lit. 'Out of Åmål [i.e. leaving the town]'\n- Spanish: Descubriendo el Amor (\"Discovering Love\")\n- Portuguese: Amigas de Colégio (\"School Friends\")\n- Czech: Láska je láska (\"Love is Love\") The Czech title is based on a Lucie Bílá song of the same name, which references homosexuality.[12][8]\n- Russian: Покажи мне любовь (Pokazhi mne lyubov, \"Show Me Love\")\n- Hebrew: F- Åmål[8]\n- English: Show Me Love[8][13]\n- French (Canada): Qui Aimes-Tu? (\"Who do you love/like?\")[14]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Political controversy\n\nEven before the film was completed, it created controversy in the town of Åmål. Local politicians campaigned to get the title changed because they argued that it would show the town in an unfair way and even undermine it as an economic centre.[10] Further pressure was brought on the makers of the film, the Film i Väst studio, who are partly financed by Swedish local authorities, including Åmål.\n\nHowever, the local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film. Since the release, the town of Åmål has tried to embrace the publicity generated, despite the fact that the town's name is missing from the English title. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music \"Fucking Åmål Festival.\"\n\n### Critical and commercial response\n\nFucking Åmål received the highest audience figures for a Swedish film in 1998–9, with a total audience of 867,576 and a total audience for the whole of Europe of 2.1 million.[1] It grossed $6.5 million in Sweden and $3 million in Norway.[15] Some international reports stated that the film had outgrossed the Hollywood film Titanic in Sweden.[16] In fact, Titanic had over twice as many viewers as Show Me Love in Sweden in 1998.[17]\n\nShow Me Love has an approval rating of 91% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews, and an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"A naturalistic depiction of teenage life, Show Me Love has a charming, authentic feel\".[3] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generaly favorable reviews\".[18] It is among the top ten of the British Film Institute list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.[19]\n\nThe film received consistently good reviews, including the realism and credibility of its portrayal of what it is like to be a teenager in a small town in the 1990s. In addition, the efforts of the young actors were praised. Jan-Olov Andersson at Aftonbladet felt that Dahlström's and Liljeberg's imaginative appearance and interaction was \"sensationally credible\", and Bo Ludvigsson at Svenska Dagbladet wrote that it was \"a warm, strong and confident film about the courage to be human\". Ludvigsson also believed that Fucking Åmål, with its storytelling drive, leave and authenticity, was well above most of the Swedish films of recent years. Anders Hansson at Göteborgs-Posten thought that director Moodysson with fairly ordinary elements created \"a film with unusual rise\".[2]\n\nAutostraddle placed it at number 20 on its \"Top 100 Best Lesbian Movies\" list.[20]\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nAccording to Russian singer Lena Katina, producer Ivan Shapovalov was inspired to create the pop duo t.A.T.u. after the release of this film.[21] The track \"Show Me Love\" is featured in their album 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane.\n\nThe creators of the 2018 Netflix series Everything Sucks! called the film the \"biggest influence\" on that show's creation.[22]\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\n|   Year  | Award                                                | Category                                     | Nominee(s)                             | Result    | Ref.    |\n|---------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|   1999  | Amanda Award                                         | Best Foreign Feature Film                    | Fucking Åmål, director Lukas Moodysson | Won       | [23]    |\n|   1999  | Amanda Award                                         | Best Nordic Feature Film                     | Lukas Moodysson                        | Nominated |         |\n|   1999  | Atlantic Film Festival                               | Best International Feature                   | Lukas Moodysson                        | Won       |         |\n|   1999  | Berlin International Film Festival                   | C.I.C.A.E.

Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it. Agnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party. Elin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes. After becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car. Elin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school. The film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying 'It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.'\",\n            \"Cast\": [\n                \"Alexandra Dahlström as Elin Olsson\",\n                \"Rebecka Liljeberg as Agnes Ahlberg\",\n                \"Erica Carlson as Jessica Olsson\",\n                \"Mathias Rust as Johan Hulth\",\n                \"Stefan Hörberg as Markus\",\n                \"Josefine Nyberg as Viktoria\",\n                \"Ralph Carlsson as Agnes's father, Olof\",\n                \"Maria Hedborg as Agnes's mother, Karin\",\n                \"Axel Widegren as Agnes's little brother, Oskar\",\n                \"Jill Ung as Elin's and Jessica's mother, Birgitta\"\n            ],\n            \"Awards\": [\n                \"Won four Guldbagge Awards at the 1999 ceremony\",\n                \"Teddy Award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival\",\n                \"Special Jury Prize at the 34th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival\",\n                \"Selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 71st Academy Awards\"\n            ],\n            \"BoxOffice\": {\n                \"Budget\": \"SEK 9 million\",\n                \"Admissions\": \"2.1 million\"\n            }\n        }\n    </AdditionalInformation>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information about the film \"Show Me Love\" according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains clear and informative while highlighting key details with XML tags.",

The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Ducournau's direction and screenplay, though was met with some controversy for its graphic content.\n\n## Plot\n\nLifelong vegetarian Justine begins her first semester at veterinary school, the same one her older sister Alexia is attending and where their parents met. On her first night, she meets her gay roommate Adrien, and they are forced to partake in a week-long hazing ritual, welcoming the new students. They are brought to a party, where Alexia shows Justine old class photos of students bathed in blood, including one with their parents. The next morning, the new class is splattered with blood and is forced to eat raw rabbit kidneys. Justine refuses because of her vegetarianism, but Alexia forces her to eat one. Justine leaves with Adrien and later discovers an itchy rash all over her body. She consults a doctor, who diagnoses her with food poisoning and gives her cream for the rash.\n\nThe next day, Justine begins having cravings for meat, which makes her feel ashamed. After a failed attempt to steal a burger from the cafeteria, she and Adrien take a late-night trip to a gas station so no one will see her eating meat. Unsatisfied, she eats raw chicken in the morning, and later throws up a long bundle of her own hair she had been chewing on. That night, Alexia attempts to give her a bikini wax, but when Alexia tries to cut the wax off with sharp scissors, Justine kicks her away and Alexia accidentally cuts off her own finger. Alexia faints, and Justine picks up the finger, tastes the blood, and starts eating it. Alexia wakes up to find Justine doing this but later tells their parents that her dog, Quicky, ate it.\n\nThe next morning, Alexia takes Justine to a deserted road, where Alexia jumps in front of a car, causing the two people in it to crash into a tree. Alexia starts eating one of the passengers so that her sister will \"learn\"; Justine is dismayed. Despite this, Justine's craving for human meat grows and she starts lusting after Adrien. That night, she arrives at a party, where paint is thrown at her as part of another hazing ritual and she is forced to make out with a boy. While kissing, Justine bites the middle of his bottom lip off, leaving the other party guests shocked and disgusted. Justine returns to her dorm and takes a shower, where she picks a chunk of his lip out of her teeth and eats it. Justine confides in Adrien and they end up having sex, during which Justine tries to bite Adrien but instead bites her own arm until it bleeds profusely, seeming to orgasm while doing so.\n\nAt another party, Justine becomes extremely intoxicated and Alexia takes her to the morgue. The next day, everyone in school stares at Justine, some avoiding her. Adrien shows her a video where Justine is crawling on all fours, attempting to take a bite out of the arm of a corpse as Alexia eggs her on, to boos and cheers from a crowd of watching party guests. Justine confronts Alexia and fights her, eventually biting each other until they are pulled apart by other students. Justine helps Alexia up, and they walk each other back to their dorms. The next morning, Justine wakes up in bed with Adrien and notices she is covered in blood. She pulls off the blankets, finding Adrien dead with most of his right leg eaten and a stab wound in his back. Justine then sees a bloody Alexia slumped on the floor. Justine is initially furious that Alexia killed Adrien but then cleans Alexia and herself up in the shower.\n\nAlexia is imprisoned for the murder of Adrien, and Justine is sent back home. There, Justine's father tells her that what happened is neither hers nor Alexia's fault. He explains that when he first met their mother, he could not understand why she did not want to be with him. Her father says he finally realized when they kissed the first time, indicating a scar on his lip. He then opens his shirt, revealing scars and missing chunks of his chest, and assures Justine that she will find a solution.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Garance Marillier as Justine\n- Ella Rumpf as Alexia\n- Rabah Naït Oufella[9] as Adrien\n- Laurent Lucas as father\n- Joana Preiss as mother\n- Bouli Lanners as the driver\n- Marion Vernoux as the nurse\n- Jean-Louis Sbille as the professor\n\n## Themes\n\nComing-of-age\n\nRaw follows Justine's coming-of-age throughout the film. The audience experiences Justine's journey into vet school and her assimilation (or lack thereof) into this new society. Ducournau throughout the film creates references to other classic coming-of-age cinema that came before her film, for example a reference to Carrie being assaulted with pig blood. The film uses cannibalism as an extended metaphor for the horror and uncertainty that can come with entering academia.[10]\n\nSisterhood\n\nRaw focuses on the central familial relationship between the two sisters, Alexia and Justine. The duality of the two sisters is established early on in the film as an idealized good girl[11] and the rebellious older sister. The film follows primarily Justine's journey into a world where Alexia is already well-adapted. Alexia begins to have a predatory relationship, manipulating Justine into becoming a traditionally more feminine[12] version of herself. The sister's relationship is strained later on in the movie, as the jealousy over each other's relationship with Adrien sets in. Though this strain leads to tragedy with the death of Adrien, the sisterhood remains intact.\n\n## Production\n\nJulia Ducournau answers several questions on the production of Raw in her 2017 interview with Nicolas Rapold in Film Comment. One such question she answered was in regards to her deciding on the actresses who play Justine and Alexia, Garance Marillier being a long time muse of Ducournau's, and Ella Rumpf being discovered from her previous role in the 2014 Swiss-German film, Chrieg.[13]\n\nThe film was shot on location at a school located in Liège, Belgium, a decision on Ducournau's part due to the \"American\" style campus that does not really exist in France, according to the director.[13]\n\nIt took two months of pre-production prep work in Liège, followed by two months of shooting to make Raw.[13]\n\nGarance Marillier was replaced by a body double in the waxing scene.[14]\n\n## Release\n\nRaw was screened in the Critics' Week section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI Prize.[1][15]\n\nDuring a screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, some viewers received emergency medical services after allegedly fainting from the film's graphic scenes.[16][17] Ducournau said she was \"shocked\" to hear this during a Q&amp;A after the screening. The film won several awards in European film festivals, including the top prizes at the Sitges Film Festival, Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer, and the Paris International Fantastic Film Festival.[18] It also won Best Feature Film at the 2016 Monster Fest in Melbourne, Australia.[19]\n\nThe film had a limited theatrical release in the United States by Focus World starting on 10 March 2017.[20]\n\n## Reception\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 93% approval score based on 200 reviews and an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's consensus states: \"Raw's lurid violence and sexuality live up to its title, but they're anchored with an immersive atmosphere and deep symbolism that linger long after the provocative visuals fade.\"[21] On Metacritic, it has an 81 out of 100 rating based on 33 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[22]\n\nCatherine Bray of Variety wrote, \"Suspiria meets Ginger Snaps in a muscular yet elegant campus cannibal horror from bright new talent Julia Ducournau.\"[23] Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film an A− grade, stating, \"The strongest of the female-led films I've screened so far at the festival is Raw, Julia Ducournau's beautifully realized, symbolically rich, and disturbingly erotic meditation on primal hungers of all kinds.\"[24]\n\nDavid Fear of Rolling Stone praised the film highly, giving it a rare perfect score of 4 out of 4 stars; going so far as calling it \"a contender for best horror movie of the decade\".[25]\n\nFor The Canadian Press, David Friend wrote from the Toronto International Film Festival that the film \"had audiences squirming in their seats and a few queasy patrons rushing for the exits,\" but he noted it was \"far more than a gory horror film. Director Julia Ducournau brings a sense of humanity to the story.\"[26]\n\nNick Pinkerton of Sight &amp; Sound gave a rather lukewarm review of the movie, labeling it \"another unwieldy metaphor bundled in showy cinematography\", citing the movie's \"curatorial preciousness\" as well as an overall insistence on contrived set pieces.[27]\n\nIn December 2017, film critic Mark Kermode named Raw the best film of 2017.[28]\n\nJustin Chang of The Los Angeles Times wrote that \"the fluidity and unpredictability of the human appetite is one of the movie's most playful and persistent themes.\"[29]\n\n## Awards\n\n- 2016: FIPRESCI prize in the \"parallel sections\" category, conferred by a jury of the International Federation of Film Critics for a film at either the Directors' Fortnight or Critics' Week running parallel to the Cannes Film Festival.[30]\n- 2016: Toronto International Film Festival, third place in the audience voting for the Grolsch People's Choice Midnight Madness Award.[31]\n- 2016: Sutherland Award, for most original and imaginative first feature at the London Film Festival.[32]\n- 2016: Méliès d'Or for Best European Fantastic Film\n- 2016: The film won two awards at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival :\n    - Golden Octopus of the best international fantastic movie\n    - Public Choice Award of the best international fantastic movie\n- 2016: Flanders International Film Festival Ghent :  Explore Award\n- 2017: Prix Louis-Delluc for best first film\n- It received four nominations at the 8th Magritte Awards, winning Best Foreign Film in Coproduction and Best Production Design.[33]\n- 2018: Australian Film Critics Association nominated for Best International Film (Foreign Language).[34]\n\n## See also\n\n- Cannibalism in popular culture\n- New French Extremity\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"Grave\".

Few films snowball from their ominous prologue like SUPER DARK TIMES, a quintessential angsty-teen melodrama that deftly cannonballs itself into the terrain of a horror-thriller. Debut director Kevin Phillips, who hails from a background of commercial cinematography, exceptionally breathes life into the monotony of ‘90s east coast Americana. And that’s perhaps the biggest takeaway here: SUPER DARK TIMES is a case study that no milieu is too bland. If you can make suburbia this compelling, then by God, anything is possible.\n\nAfter a traumatic accident causes a rift in allegiances between two best friends, Phillips lures his audience into a narrative of mental decay. It’s the darkest version of STAND BY ME you’ll ever see, and the comparisons to 2017’s IT remake are boundless. Frankly, it’s almost the same film, clown notwithstanding. Sure, that sounds like a huge cinematic difference, but thematically, both films deal with friendship and the need to overcome trauma. It’s fascinating how Phillips digests this in comparison to Stephen King’s classic novel, gearing itself a little further from straight horror and gunning for the psychological aftermath instead.\n\nI firmly believe Charlie Tahan could play Ansel Elgort’s brother\n\nOf all contemporary children-on-bicycle nostalgia flicks, SUPER DARK TIMES is ostensibly the least insufferable throwback. There’s a genuine focus on story and character that helps the film bypass any needless sentimentality. Although Phillips film is squarely set in the 1990s, its themes are broadly universal, and in turn, its setting becomes rather independent of everything. Avoiding overused nostalgia tropes of twangy synthesizer music and lazy pop-culture references, SUPER DARK TIMES actually manages to just let its characters inhabit their world.\n\nWhich begs to question why it’s actually set in the ‘90s. Well, the easy answer is that Phillips is drawing from his own childhood, a perfectly reasonable answer if you ask me. But SUPER DARK TIMES does make a compelling case for its era outside of this. Its narrative is set at a time where letting your child get on a bicycle and roam free was far less of a parental concern than it is today. It’s distinctly pre-Columbine in its socio-political backdrop, and it works rather effectively.\n\nWould bet money the ‘90s setting was reverse engineered to accommodate this shot\n\nUnfortunately, the only real holdback is the depth of the character writing. Phillips has a hard time justifying the behavior of one of his characters all the way through to the end of the film, and an absence of paternal figures—as well as completely forgettable maternal ones—negates any conclusion that I could draw about these kids’ upbringing. Because our two leads end up so different, I’d have appreciated seeing a more distinct contrast in their domestic lives. I was willing to play ball with Phillips’s narrative approach for most of his film, but when it takes a hard left into much more sinister territory, I can’t help but feel that SUPER DARK TIMES wasted a solid opportunity to make a film about paranoia rather than justified fear.\n\nHaving said all that, Phillips’s film profits greatly from its outstanding central performances. Lead actors Owen Campbell and Charlie Tahan perform with a level of natural vulnerability that astutely captures the existential malaise of postmodern youth. It’s a film where our demons lie dormant and can be awakened at the drop of a hat, one where the fallout of bullying and late-teen shenanigans can have drastic repercussions. It’s a powerfully captured film, one directed with care and attention, precisely framed and elegantly staged. Phillips’s film may leave something to be desired in characterization, but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t showcase the merits of coordinated filmmaking.\n\nVerdict: Recommend\n\n- Posted in\n- Film Reviews\n\n- Tagged with\n- film\n- film reviews\n- Kevin Phillips\n- Merry-Go-Round Magazine\n- merrygoroundmagazine.com\n- Super Dark Times\n- thriller\n\n- Share\n- Tweet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSergio is a film connoisseur from Romania.

These films are often ignored in theaters but quickly develop cult followings. Columnist Molly Henery, who named and defined the subgenre, tackles a new film each month and analyzes how it fits into this bloody new corner of horror.\n\nLast month I dissected the teenage hell that is Jennifer’s Body. For May, it’s time to look at a different kind of adolescent nightmare. The film is Blue My Mind, a 2017 Swiss production that combines elements of Thirteen, Ginger Snaps, and The Thirteenth Year to tell a story of physical and emotional transformation.\n\nDirector Lisa Brühlmann (Killing Eve, Castle Rock) co-wrote Blue My Mind with Dominik Locher (Tempo Girl, Goliath). Mia (Luna Wedler) appears to be a typical young teenage girl. Shortly after her family moves to a new town, Mia begins to experience many changes. For the most part these changes are typical of a girl going through puberty, such as experiencing her first period and becoming sexually active. Yet, all the while, a much more bizarre change is taking place. As odd as it may sound, Mia is transforming into a mermaid. While the majority of Blue My Mind is a fairly straightforward coming-of-age drama, its focus on the body pushes it into Uterus Horror territory.\n\nIt all begins when Mia’s family moves to a new apartment. On her first day of school, Mia notices a group of kids who appear to be the more mature, popular, rebellious kids in class. It’s immediately evident she wants to befriend these people. At first, the group rejects and mocks her because they believe Mia to be too immature. One of the boys in the group even asks if she’s ever had a period. Slowly but surely, Mia maneuvers her way into the clique. First by smoking, drinking, and stealing with the girls, then having sex for the first time with one of the boys. She goes from a sweet girl to a completely uncontrollable teenager in a short amount of time.\n\nMuch like the acclaimed film Thirteen, Blue My Mind gives a disturbing—yet all too accurate—portrayal of girlhood and the lengths we often go to in order to feel accepted. Much of Mia’s emotional journey is directly connected to the leader of the clique, Gianna (Zoë Pastelle Holthuizen). Mia’s desire to be accepted by Gianna blurs the lines between wanting to befriend someone, wanting to be someone, and wanting to date them. With all the hormones swirling around during puberty, it is often hard for young girls to differentiate between these feelings. As a result, Mia is willing to do just about anything to get close to Gianna, regardless of the consequences.\n\nThis aspect of the film is something that really hit home for me. I was someone who, in high school, wanted to simply be liked. Unfortunately, that meant doing a lot of truly stupid shit that I still regret to this day. While I was never one to really go to parties or drink, I was a depressed girl who had been taught by society that my worth was my body and that the only way to keep boys around, even just as friends, was to be a sexual object for them. When I think back on my high school days and the choices I made to feel accepted, I’m genuinely shocked I didn’t end up in a morgue. Sadly, far too many young girls go through this same experience, but very few filmmakers choose to make films about it because people would rather pretend it doesn’t happen.\n\nIn Blue My Mind, feeling like an outsider is just the status quo. Mia is an outcast at school because she is the new girl, arriving after friendships have already been formed. This is largely why she is so desperate to gain Gianna’s favor. Mia’s sense of being alone in the world only grows throughout the film, especially when she begins to gradually transform into a mermaid. She knows what’s happening to her isn’t what other girls go through, so she feels she has no one to relate to. Her changes even lead her to believe she was adopted since it is obvious her human-looking mother never went through the bizarre metamorphosis.\n\nMia acts out in two ways to combat this lonely feeling. The first is by trying to feel close to others. Whether befriending Gianna or having sexual encounters with strange men, Mia simply needs to feel connected to another human. The second way is by numbing herself. She drinks, she does drugs, and she even resorts to self-harm. Anything to distract her from her emotional anguish. This, unfortunately, is also something many women are familiar with.\n\nBrühlmann and Locker make the tough subject matter in Blue My Mind more digestible for the masses by incorporating the mermaid transformation. The same day Mia gets her first period, she takes a bath to shave her legs and notices her toes have become webbed. After seeing the doctor and getting no help, she takes matters into her own hands by cutting the webbing with small scissors and putting bandages over the cuts.\n\nThe changes only become more drastic from there. Bruising appears down by her ankles and gradually works its way up her legs as the skin starts to slough off. Eventually, her belly button vanishes. As the changes come more rapidly, Mia is shown peeling what appears to be large scales off of her legs. Then, her legs finally start to fuse together in the middle. In a panic, Mia cuts her arm and passes out. When she awakes, her legs are no more. Instead, they have been replaced by a large mermaid tail.\n\nWhile the word “mermaid” is never actually used in Blue My Mind, it seems to be a purposeful choice to have that be what Mia turns into. Historically, mermaids and the legends surrounding them convey these creatures as objects of sexual desire for men. They aren’t human, they are simply feminine things for sailors to gawk at and try to capture for their own purposes. This isn’t far from how young women are perceived by the men around them. Almost all the men Mia and Gianna encounter throughout the film only care about using the girls for sexual gain. While the film makes it obvious both girls are looked at by men in this way, the focus on Mia makes the parallel between girls and mermaid clear for the audience.\n\nBlue My Mind has a story that is all too real, despite the fact that it has a mermaid transformation. I hope more women discover it; perhaps from reading this article, or maybe by stumbling upon it on Tubi or another streaming service. So many girls and women have gone through the same quest for acceptance as Mia, and so many have had this take them down a dangerous or destructive path. Having the protagonist turn into a creature often seen as a sexual object further solidifies her feeling of loneliness while at the same time emphasizing society’s views on women. Blue My Mind is a cautionary tale more audiences should pay attention to for the sake of all young girls.\n\nVisit our Editorials page for more articles like this.

Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The film is set in a dystopian future Los Angeles of 2019, in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on space colonies. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.\n\nBlade Runner initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others critiqued its slow pacing and lack of action. The film's soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score. Blade Runner later became a cult film, and has since come to be regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films. Hailed for its production design depicting a high-tech but decaying future, the film is often regarded as both a leading example of neo-noir cinema and a foundational work of the cyberpunk[9] genre. It has influenced many science fiction films, video games, anime, and television series. It also brought the work of Dick to Hollywood's attention and led to several film adaptations of his works. In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nSeven different versions of Blade Runner exist as a result of controversial changes requested by studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the earliest movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros. released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version; this is the only version over which Scott retained artistic control.\n\nThe film is the first of the franchise of the same name. A sequel, titled Blade Runner 2049, was released in 2017 alongside a trilogy of short films covering the thirty-year span between the two films' settings. The anime series Blade Runner: Black Lotus was released in 2021.\n\n## Plot\n\nNote: Since there are several versions of , this summary excludes version-specific events. See the  article for discussion of version-specific plot elements.\n\nIn 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer Rick Deckard is detained by Officer Gaff, who likes to make origami figures, and is brought to his former supervisor, Bryant. Deckard, whose job as a \"blade runner\" was to track down bioengineered humanoids known as replicants and terminally \"retire\" them, is informed that four replicants are on Earth illegally. Deckard begins to leave, but Bryant makes veiled threats and Deckard stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named Holden administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses to questions. The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other Nexus-6 replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris.\n\nBryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, Eldon Tyrell, so he can administer the V-K test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant Rachael. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes privately to Tyrell that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an \"emotional cushion\", and that she has no knowledge of her true nature.\n\nIn searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a scale from the skin of an animal, which is later identified as a synthetic snake scale. Deckard returns to his apartment, where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, and she leaves in tears.\n\nReplicants Roy and Leon meanwhile investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of J. F. Sebastian, a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.\n\nA photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant also orders him to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, but he is ambushed by Leon, who knocks the gun out of Deckard's hand and beats him. As Leon is about to kill Deckard, Rachael saves him by using Deckard's gun to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment and, during a discussion, he promises not to track her down. As Rachael abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her and forces her to kiss him, and she ultimately relents. Deckard leaves Rachael at his apartment and departs to search for the remaining replicants.\n\nRoy arrives at Sebastian's apartment and tells Pris that the other replicants are dead. Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will be cut short, like the replicants that were built with a four-year lifespan. Roy uses Sebastian to gain entrance to Tyrell's penthouse. He demands more life from his maker, which Tyrell says is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\" but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell and then kills him by crushing his skull. Sebastian tries to flee and is later reported dead.[nb 1]\n\nAt Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building and onto the roof. Deckard tries to jump onto another roof but is left hanging from the edge. Roy makes the jump with ease and, as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof to save him. Before Roy dies, he laments that his memories \"will be lost in time, like tears in rain\". Gaff arrives to congratulate Deckard, also reminding him that Rachael will not live, but \"then again, who does?\" Deckard returns to his apartment to retrieve Rachael. While escorting her to the elevator, he notices a small origami unicorn on the floor. He recalls Gaff's words and departs with Rachael.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard\n- Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty\n- Sean Young as Rachael\n- Edward James Olmos as Gaff\n- M.

Studios lot (Burbank, California)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterest in adapting Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese was interested in filming the novel, but never optioned it.[11] Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert, saying, \"Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done ... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?'\"[12]\n\nThe screenplay by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977.[13] Producer Michael Deeley became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project but, after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.[14] He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13 million to $15 million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie).[nb 2] Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles.[15] Eventually, he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.[16]\n\nHaving invested more than $2.5 million in pre-production,[17] as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5 million in financing through a three-way deal between the Ladd Company (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer Sir Run Run Shaw and Tandem Productions.[18]\n\nDick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.[19] After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite.[20] Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.[21] He said, \"I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.\" He also approved of the film's script, saying: \"After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel.\"[22] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.[23] Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.[24]\n\nIn 1992, Ford revealed, \"Blade Runner is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley.\"[25] Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: \"When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king [sic] nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests.\"[26] \"I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it.\"[27] The narration monologs were written by an uncredited Roland Kibbee.[28]\n\nIn 2006, Scott was asked \"Who's the biggest pain in the arse you've ever worked with?\" He replied: \"It's got to be Harrison ... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie.\"[29] Ford said of Scott in 2000: \"I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it.\"[30] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: \"What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover ... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another.\"[31] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. \"Harrison's fully on board\", said Scott.[32]\n\nThe Bradbury Building in Los Angeles was used as one of the filming locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles served as a filming location, and a Warner Bros. backlot housed the 2019 Los Angeles street sets. Other locations included the Ennis-Brown House and the 2nd Street Tunnel. Test screenings resulted in several changes, including adding a voice-over, a happy ending, and the removal of a Holden hospital scene. The relationship between the filmmakers and the investors was difficult, which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film.[33] Crew members created T-shirts during filming saying, \"Yes Guv'nor, My Ass\" that mocked Scott's unfavorable comparison of U.S. and British crews; Scott responded with a T-shirt of his own, \"Xenophobia Sucks\", making the incident known as the T-shirt war.[34][35]\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind.[36] According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Falk, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds.[36][37] Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision.[36] Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford's interest in the Blade Runner story, and discussions with Steven Spielberg, who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film.[36] Following his success in those two films, Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth.[26]\n\nRutger Hauer was cast as Roy Batty,[38] the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants.[39] Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based on his performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies that Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange, and Turkish Delight).[36] Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as \"the perfect Batty – cold, Aryan, flawless\".[21] Of the many films Hauer made, Blade Runner was his favorite. In a live chat in 2001, he said \"Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just [is]. All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome.\"[40] Hauer rewrote his character's \"tears in rain\" speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.\n\nBlade Runner used a number of then-lesser-known actors: Sean Young portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human;[41] Nina Axelrod auditioned for the role.[36] Fancher originally wrote the role for his then girlfriend Barbara Hershey.[42] Daryl Hannah portrays Pris, a \"basic pleasure model\" replicant; Stacey Nelkin auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.[36] Debbie Harry turned down the role of Pris.[43][44] Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests with Morgan Paull playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.[36] Brion James portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat and laborer replicant, and Joanna Cassidy portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant.\n\nEdward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos drew on diverse ethnic sources to help create the fictional \"Cityspeak\" language his character uses in the film.[45] His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, \"Horse dick [bullshit]! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner.\"[45] M. Emmet Walsh portrays Captain Bryant, a rumpled, hard-drinking and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J. F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions,[46] and he shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease.[47] Joe Pantoliano had earlier been considered for the role.[48] James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrayed the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis – in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott, whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.[49]\n\n### Design\n\nScott credits Edward Hopper's painting Nighthawks and the French science fiction comics magazine Métal Hurlant, to which the artist Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud contributed, as stylistic mood sources.[50] He also drew on the landscape of \"Hong Kong on a very bad day\"[51] and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in northeast England.[52] The visual style of the movie is influenced by the work of futurist Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia.[53] Scott hired Syd Mead as his concept artist; like Scott, he was influenced by Métal Hurlant.[54] Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of Blade Runner, but he declined so that he could work on René Laloux's animated film Les Maîtres du temps – a decision that he later regretted.[55] Production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film, and Mark Stetson served as chief model maker.[56]\n\nBlade Runner has numerous similarities to Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building – the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runner's miniature building shots.[57]\n\nThe extended end scene in the original theatrical release shows Rachael and Deckard traveling into daylight with pastoral aerial shots filmed by director Stanley Kubrick. Ridley Scott contacted Kubrick about using some of his surplus helicopter aerial photography from The Shining.[58][59][60]\n\n#### Spinner\n\nA \"spinner\" (police variant) on display at Disney-MGM Studios in the 1990s\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\"Spinner\" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise much like vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police as patrol cars, and wealthy people can also acquire spinner licenses.[61] The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an aerodyne – a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: \"conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity\".[62][63] A spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington.[64] Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield; at least two were working ground vehicles, while others were light-weight mockups for crane shots and set decoration for street shots.[65] Two of them ended up at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, but were later destroyed, and a few others remain in private collections.[65]\n\n#### Voight-Kampff machine\n\nA very advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body. The bellows were designed for the latter function and give the machine the menacing air of a sinister insect. The VK is used primarily by Blade Runners to determine if a suspect is truly human by measuring the degree of his empathic response through carefully worded questions and statements.\n\nThe Voight-Kampff machine is a fictional interrogation tool, originating from the novel (where it is spelled \"Voigt-Kampff\"). The Voight-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by blade runners to determine whether an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement in response to questions dealing with empathy.[66] In real life an approximation of the test using questions was created and used in jest by a newspaper in 2003 on the Mayoral candidates for the city of San Francisco, United States, apparently proving that at least half of them would be classified as replicants.[67][68]\n\n### Music\n\nThe Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film noir retro-future envisioned by Scott.[69] Vangelis, fresh from his Academy Award-winning score for Chariots of Fire,[70] composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.[71] He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator Demis Roussos.[72] Another memorable sound is the tenor sax solo \"Love Theme\" by British saxophonist Dick Morrissey, who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used \"Memories of Green\" from the Vangelis album See You Later, an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone to Watch Over Me.[73]\n\nAlong with Vangelis's compositions and ambient textures, the film's soundscape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia – \"Ogi no Mato\" or \"The Folding Fan as a Target\" from the Nonesuch Records release Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music – and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from \"Harps of the Ancient Temples\" on Laurel Records.[74]\n\nDespite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.[72]\n\nThese delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many bootleg recordings over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 \"Off World Music, Ltd\" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.[72] A set with three CDs of Blade Runner-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled Blade Runner Trilogy, the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the film, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the film.[75]\n\n### Special effects\n\nThe film's special effects are generally recognized to be among the best in the genre,[76][77] using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest. Special effects engineers who worked on the film are often praised for the innovative technology they used to produce and design certain aspects of those visuals.[78] In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers.[76] Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.[79]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical run\n\nBlade Runner was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer Alan Ladd Jr. because his previous highest-grossing films (Star Wars and Alien) had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the 25th of the month his \"lucky day\".[80] Blade Runner grossed reasonably good ticket sales in its opening weekend; earning $6.1 million during its first weekend in theaters.[81] The film was released close to other major science-fiction and fantasy releases such as The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Conan the Barbarian and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which affected its commercial success.[82]\n\n### Versions\n\nSeveral versions of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.[83][84] The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre.[85] Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.[86] A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.[87]\n\nTwo versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (117 minutes),[1] known as the original version or Domestic Cut (released on Betamax, CED Videodisc and VHS in 1983, and on LaserDisc in 1987), and the International Cut (117 minutes), also known as the \"Criterion Edition\" or \"uncut version\", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S. and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video releases, the International Cut was later released on VHS and The Criterion Collection Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a \"10th Anniversary Edition\".[88]\n\nRidley Scott's Director's Cut (1992, 116 minutes)[89] had significant changes from the theatrical version including the removal of Deckard's voice-over, the re-insertion of a sequence in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn, and the removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the Director's Cut.[90]\n\nIt is often falsely claimed that the unicorn sequence was an outtake from Ridley Scott's follow-up film Legend which also features unicorns, but it was in fact shot for Blade Runner as \"additional photography\" by second unit cinematographer Brian Tufano.[91]\n\nScott's definitive The Final Cut (2007, 117 minutes)[92] was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in December 2007.[93] This is the only version over which Scott had complete artistic and editorial control.[90]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 89% approval rating based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.\"[94] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[95]\n\nInitial reactions among film critics were mixed. Some wrote that the plot took a back seat to the film's special effects and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action and adventure film. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.[96] Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace.[97] Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it \"Blade Crawler\", and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as \"science fiction pornography\".[98] Pauline Kael praised Blade Runner as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in \"human terms\".[99] Ares magazine said, \"Misunderstood by audiences and critics alike, it is by far the best science fiction film of the year.\"[100]\n\n### Cultural analysis\n\nAcademics began analyzing the film almost as soon as it was released. One of the first books on the film was Paul M. Sammon's Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner (1996),[101] which dissects all the details concerning the film making. He was followed by Scott Bukatman's Blade Runner[102] and other books and academic articles.[103] In Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image, Décio Torres Cruz analyzes the philosophical and psychological issues and the literary influences in Blade Runner. He examines the film's cyberpunk and dystopic elements by establishing a link between the Biblical, classical and modern traditions and the postmodern aspects in the film's collage of several literary texts.[9]\n\nThe boom in home video formats helped establish a growing cult around the film,[78] which scholars have dissected for its dystopic aspects, questions regarding \"authentic\" humanity, ecofeminist aspects[104] and use of conventions from multiple genres.[105] Popular culture began to reassess its impact as a classic several years after it was released.[106][107][108] Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original and the Director's Cut and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin.[39] He later added The Final Cut to his \"Great Movies\" list.[109] Critic Chris Rodley and Janet Maslin theorized that Blade Runner changed cinematic and cultural discourse through its image repertoire and subsequent influence on films.[110] In 2012, Time film critic Richard Corliss surgically analyzed the durability, complexity, screenplay, sets and production dynamics from a personal, three-decade perspective.[111] Denis Villeneuve, who directed the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, cites the film as a huge influence for him and many others.[108]\n\nIt has also been noted for its postmodernist approach and that it contributes to the historical development of modern dystopia in film.[112] Furthermore, the futuristic version of Los Angeles has been widely discussed by academics with some comparing it to Milton's descriptions of hell in Paradise Lost.[113] A 2019 retrospective in the BBC argued that elements of the film's socio-political themes remained prescient in the real year of the film's setting, such as its depiction of climate change.[114] From a more philosophical perspective, Alison Landsberg described Scott's direction of the film as a \"prosthetic memory\"—an action that has never happened and appears to be divorced from lived experience, yet it defines personhood and identity within the wider Blade Runner universe.[115]\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nBlade Runner won or received nominations for the following awards:[116]\n\n|   Year | Award                                | Category                         | Nominee                                                            | Result              |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n|  1982  | British Society of Cinematographers  | Best Cinematography              | Jordan Cronenweth                                                  | Nominated           |\n|  1982  | Los Angeles Film Critics Association | Best Cinematography              | Jordan Cronenweth                                                  | Won                 |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Cinematography              | Jordan Cronenweth                                                  | Won                 |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Costume Design              | Charles Knode and Michael Kaplan                                   | Won                 |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Editing                     | Terry Rawlings                                                     | Nominated           |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Film Music                  | Vangelis                                                           | Nominated           |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Makeup and Hair             | Marvin Westmore                                                    | Nominated           |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Production Design           | Lawrence G.

It employs some of the conventions of film noir, among them the character of a femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook – extending to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.[120][121] It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris.[122] It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood,[123] and literary sources, such as Frankenstein[124] and William Blake.[125] Although Scott said any similarity was merely coincidental,[126] fans claimed that the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell was based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851.[127]\n\nBlade Runner delves into the effects of technology on the environment and society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is represented in the \"retrofitted\" future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as \"extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel\". He also said that he \"liked the idea of exploring pain\" in the wake of his brother's death: \"When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.\"[128]\n\nA sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades the world of the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored –\nespecially regarding replicants' implanted memories. The film depicts a world post ecocide, where warfare and capitalism have led to destruction of 'normal' ecological systems.[129][130] Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand in hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors.[131] This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to \"off-world\" (extraterrestrial) colonies. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question the nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.[132][133] The film also consists of themes of Japan as a power, coming amid a time of anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States.[134]\n\nThese thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner's central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals – seemingly an essential indicator of one's \"humanity\". Replicants will not respond the same way humans would, showing a lack of concern. The film goes so far as to question if Deckard might be a replicant, in the process asking the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.[135]\n\nThe question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release.[136][137] Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human, while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity.[138] Ridley Scott has stated that he envisaged Deckard as a replicant.[139][140] Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, inserted into Scott's Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant – because Gaff could have retrieved Deckard's implanted memories.[124][141][142] The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity,[143] or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme.[144] The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted multiple interpretations.[145]\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nA police spinner flying beside enormous skyscrapers, some with electronic billboards on them. Special effects such as these were benchmarks and have been highly influential on the esthetics of subsequent sci-fi films.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTesla's Cybertruck was heavily inspired by Blade Runner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile not initially a success with North American audiences, Blade Runner was popular internationally and garnered a cult following.[146] The film's dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television programs.[120] Its influence has also extended beyond the science fiction genre, especially in the creation of cinematic worlds. For example, Denis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo del Toro, Gareth Edwards,[147] Rian Johnson,[148] Ronald D. Moore and David Eick[149] have all cited it as an influence.[42][150][151] Nolan notes that he has seen Blade Runner \"literally hundreds of times\",[147] while del Toro describes it as \"one of those cinematic drugs, that when I first saw it, I never saw the world the same way again.\"[152]\n\nThe film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1993 and is frequently taught in university courses.[153][154][155] In 2007, it was named the second-most visually influential film of all time by the Visual Effects Society.[156] The film has also been the subject of parody, such as the comics Blade Bummer by Crazy comics,[157] Bad Rubber by Steve Gallacci,[158] and the Red Dwarf 2009 three-part miniseries \"Back to Earth\".[159][160] The anime series Psycho-Pass by Production I.G was also highly influenced by the film.[161]\n\nBlade Runner continues to reflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.[162] It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists.[163] Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell franchise, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre.[164][165] Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement.[166][167][168][169] It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.[170][171] The film is also considered to be one of the early examples of the tech noir[172] subgenre.\n\nThe dialogue and music in Blade Runner has been sampled in music more than any other film of the 20th century.[173] The 2009 album I, Human by Singaporean band Deus Ex Machina makes numerous references to the genetic engineering and cloning themes from the film, and even features a track titled \"Replicant\".[174]\n\nBlade Runner is cited as a major influence on Warren Spector,[175] designer of the video game Deus Ex, which displays evidence of the film's influence in both its visual rendering and plot. Indeed, the film's look – and in particular its overall darkness, preponderance of neon lights and opaque visuals – are easier to render than complicated backdrops, making it a popular reference point for video game designers.[176][177] It has influenced adventure games such as the 2012 graphical text adventure Cypher,[178] Rise of the Dragon,[179][180] Snatcher,[180][181] the Tex Murphy series,[182] Beneath a Steel Sky,[183] Flashback: The Quest for Identity,[180] Bubblegum Crisis video games (and their original anime),[184][185] the role-playing game Shadowrun,[180] the first-person shooter Perfect Dark,[186] the shooter game Skyhammer,[187][188] and the Syndicate series of video games.[189][190]\n\nThe logos of Atari, Bell, Coca-Cola, Cuisinart, Pan Am, and RCA, all market leaders at the time, were prominently displayed as product placement in the film, and all experienced setbacks after the film's release,[191][192] leading to suggestions of a Blade Runner curse.[193] Coca-Cola and Cuisinart recovered, and Tsingtao beer was also featured in the film and was more successful after the film than before.[191]\n\nThe design of Tesla's Cybertruck was inspired by the film.[194] Prior to its release Elon Musk promised that it would \"look like something out of Blade Runner\".[195] Besides referring to the truck as the \"Blade Runner Truck\", Musk chose to debut the truck in order to coincide with the film's setting of November 2019.[196] The film's art designer Syd Mead praised the truck and said he was \"flattered\" by the homage to Blade Runner.[195]\n\n### Media recognition\n\n|   Year  | Presenter                               | Title                                                                             | Rank    | Refs            |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|\n|   2001  | The Village Voice                       | 100 Best Films of the 20th Century                                                | 94      | [197]           |\n|   2002  | Online Film Critics Society (OFCS)      | Top 100 Sci-fi Films of the Past 100 Years                                        | 2       | [198]           |\n|   2002  | Sight &amp;

Sammon to write a special issue about Blade Runner's production which became the book Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner.[220] The book chronicles Blade Runner's evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer Alan Ladd, Jr. has said, \"Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it.\"[221] Future Noir has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences as well as photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of Future Noir was published in 2007, and additional materials not in either print edition have been published online.[222]\n\nPhilip K. Dick refused a $400,000 offer to write a Blade Runner novelization, saying: \"⁠[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience\" and it \"would have probably been disastrous to me artistically\". He added, \"That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization – they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles.\"[22][223] Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was eventually reprinted as a tie-in, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title.[224] Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled Blade Runner: A Story of the Future by Les Martin was released in 1982.[225] Archie Goodwin scripted the comic book adaptation, A Marvel Comics Super Special: Blade Runner, published in September 1982, which was illustrated by Al Williamson, Carlos Garzon, Dan Green, and Ralph Reese, and lettered by Ed King.[226]\n\nBlue Dolphin Enterprises published the film's screenplay combined with selected production storyboards as The Illustrated Blade Runner (June 1982);[227] a book of original production artwork by Syd Mead, Mentor Huebner, Charles Knode, Michael Kaplan, and Ridley Scott as Blade Runner Sketchbook (1982);[228] and The Blade Runner Portfolio (1982), a collection of twelve photographic prints, similar to the artist portfolios released by their Schanes &amp; Schanes imprint.[229]\n\nThere are two video games based on the film, both titled Blade Runner: one from 1985, a side-scrolling video game for Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC by CRL Group PLC, which is marked as \"a video game interpretation of the film score by Vangelis\" rather than of the film itself (due to licensing issues); and another from 1997, a point-and-click adventure for PC by Westwood Studios. The 1997 game has a non-linear plot based in the Blade Runner world, non-player characters that each ran in their own independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game.[230] Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, J. F. Sebastian and Howie Lee appear, and their voice files are recorded by the original actors, with the exception of Gaff, who is replaced by Javier Grajeda (as Victor Gardell) and Howie Lee, who is replaced by Toru Nagai.[231] The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard.[176][177]\n\nThe television film (and later series) Total Recall 2070 was initially planned as a spin-off of the film Total Recall (based on Philip K. Dick's short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\"), but was produced as a hybrid of Total Recall and Blade Runner.[232] Many similarities between Total Recall 2070 and Blade Runner were noted, as well as apparent influences on the show from Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel and the TV series Holmes &amp; Yoyo.[233]\n\n### Documentaries\n\nThe film has been the subject of several documentaries.\n\n## Sequel and related media\n\nScreen capture of DVD bonus feature from Prometheus (2012), a dictated letter by Peter Weyland about Eldon Tyrell, chief executive officer of the Tyrell Corporation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA sequel was released in 2017, titled Blade Runner 2049, with Ryan Gosling alongside Ford in the starring roles.[238][239] It entered production in mid-2016 and is set decades after the first film.[240] Harrison Ford reprised his role as Rick Deckard. The film won two Academy Awards, for cinematography and visual effects.[241]\n\nThe world of Blade Runner has also come to be explored in animation. Blade Runner 2049 was preceded by the release of three short films that served as prequels, where the chronological first, Blade Runner Black Out 2022, was anime (the other two, 2036: Nexus Dawn and 2048: Nowhere to Run, were live action, not animated).[242]\n\nIn November 2021, a Japanese-American anime television series called Blade Runner: Black Lotus was released. The series tells the story of a female replicant protagonist, rather than that of a male Blade Runner one.[243][244]\n\nDick's friend K. W. Jeter wrote three authorized Blade Runner novels that continue Rick Deckard's story, attempting to resolve the differences between the film and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?[245] These are Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995), Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night (1996), and Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon (2000).\n\nBlade Runner co-writer David Peoples wrote the 1998 action film Soldier, which he referred to as a \"sidequel\" or spiritual successor to the original film; the two are set in a shared universe.[246] A bonus feature on the Blu-ray for Prometheus, the 2012 film by Scott set in the Alien universe, states that Eldon Tyrell, CEO of the Blade Runner Tyrell Corporation, was the mentor of Guy Pearce's character Peter Weyland.[247]\n\nIn late 2022, Amazon announced a Blade Runner 2049 sequel series would be produced.[248] On October 12, 2022, an apparent official approval to actually make a Blade Runner 2099 TV series was reported.[249]\n\n## See also\n\n- Arcology\n- Biorobotics\n- List of adaptations of works by Philip K.

Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos, it is an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The film is set in a <Themes>dystopian future</Themes> Los Angeles of 2019, in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on space colonies. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.\n\nBlade Runner initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others critiqued its slow pacing and lack of action. The film's soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score. Blade Runner later became a cult film, and has since come to be regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films. Hailed for its production design depicting a high-tech but decaying future, the film is often regarded as both a leading example of neo-noir cinema and a foundational work of the <Themes>cyberpunk</Themes> genre. It has influenced many science fiction films, video games, anime, and television series. It also brought the work of Dick to Hollywood's attention and led to several film adaptations of his works. In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nSeven different versions of Blade Runner exist as a result of controversial changes requested by studio executives. A director's cut was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the earliest movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros. released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version; this is the only version over which Scott retained artistic control.\n\nThe film is the first of the franchise of the same name. A sequel, titled Blade Runner 2049, was released in 2017 alongside a trilogy of short films covering the thirty-year span between the two films' settings.\n\n## Plot\n\nNote: Since there are several versions of Blade Runner, this summary excludes version-specific events. \n\nIn 2019 Los Angeles, former police officer Rick Deckard is detained by Officer Gaff, who likes to make origami figures, and is brought to his former supervisor, Bryant. Deckard, whose job as a \"blade runner\" was to track down bioengineered humanoids known as replicants and terminally \"retire\" them, is informed that four replicants are on Earth illegally. Deckard begins to leave, but Bryant makes veiled threats and Deckard stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named Holden administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional responses to questions. The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and three other Nexus-6 replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris.\n\nBryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, Eldon Tyrell, so he can administer the V-K test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant Rachael. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes privately to Tyrell that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an \"emotional cushion\", and that she has no knowledge of her true nature.\n\nIn searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a scale from the skin of an animal, which is later identified as a synthetic snake scale. Deckard returns to his apartment, where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, and she leaves in tears.\n\nReplicants Roy and Leon meanwhile investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of J. F. Sebastian, a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.\n\nA photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant also orders him to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, but he is ambushed by Leon, who knocks the gun out of Deckard's hand and beats him. As Leon is about to kill Deckard, Rachael saves him by using Deckard's gun to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment and, during a discussion, he promises not to track her down. As Rachael abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her and forces her to kiss him, and she ultimately relents. Deckard leaves Rachael at his apartment and departs to search for the remaining replicants.\n\nRoy arrives at Sebastian's apartment and tells Pris that the other replicants are dead. Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic premature aging disorder, his life will be cut short, like the replicants that were built with a four-year lifespan. Roy uses Sebastian to gain entrance to Tyrell's penthouse. He demands more life from his maker, which Tyrell says is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done \"questionable things\" but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell and then kills him by crushing his skull. Sebastian tries to flee and is later reported dead.\n\nAt Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building and onto the roof. Deckard tries to jump onto another roof but is left hanging from the edge. Roy makes the jump with ease and, as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof to save him. Before Roy dies, he laments that his memories \"will be lost in time, like tears in rain\". Gaff arrives to congratulate Deckard, also reminding him that Rachael will not live, but \"then again, who does?\" Deckard returns to his apartment to retrieve Rachael. While escorting her to the elevator, he notices a small origami unicorn on the floor. He recalls Gaff's words and departs with Rachael.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard\n- Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty\n- Sean Young as Rachael\n- Edward James Olmos as Gaff\n- M.

Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese was interested in filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert. \n\nThe screenplay by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977. Producer Michael Deeley became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project but, after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13 million to $15 million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. \n\nHaving invested more than $2.5 million in pre-production, as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5 million in financing through a three-way deal between the Ladd Company (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer Sir Run Run Shaw and Tandem Productions.\n\nDick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it. He said, \"I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.\" He also approved of the film's script, saying: \"After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel.\" The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.\n\nIn 1992, Ford revealed, \"Blade Runner is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley.\" Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: \"When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests.\" \"I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it.\" The narration monologs were written by an uncredited Roland Kibbee.\n\nIn 2006, Scott was asked \"Who's the biggest pain in the arse you've ever worked with?\" He replied: \"It's got to be Harrison ... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie.\" Ford said of Scott in 2000: \"I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it.\" In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: \"What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover ... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another.\" Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. \"Harrison's fully on board\", said Scott.\n\nThe Bradbury Building in Los Angeles was used as one of the filming locations. \n\nThe Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles served as a filming location, and a Warner Bros. backlot housed the 2019 Los Angeles street sets. Other locations included the Ennis-Brown House and the 2nd Street Tunnel. Test screenings resulted in several changes, including adding a voice-over, a happy ending, and the removal of a Holden hospital scene. The relationship between the filmmakers and the investors was difficult, which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film. Crew members created T-shirts during filming saying, \"Yes Guv'nor, My Ass\" that mocked Scott's unfavorable comparison of U.S. and British crews; Scott responded with a T-shirt of his own, \"Xenophobia Sucks\", making the incident known as the T-shirt war.\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind. According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Falk, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds. Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision. Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford's interest in the Blade Runner story, and discussions with Steven Spielberg, who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film. Following his success in those two films, Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth.\n\nRutger Hauer was cast as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants. Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based on his performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies that Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange, and Turkish Delight). Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as \"the perfect Batty – cold, Aryan, flawless\". Of the many films Hauer made, Blade Runner was his favorite. In a live chat in 2001, he said \"Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just [is]. All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome.\" Hauer rewrote his character's \"tears in rain\" speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.\n\nBlade Runner used a number of then-lesser-known actors: Sean Young portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human; Nina Axelrod auditioned for the role. Fancher originally wrote the role for his then girlfriend Barbara Hershey. Daryl Hannah portrays Pris, a \"basic pleasure model\" replicant; Stacey Nelkin auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming. Debbie Harry turned down the role of Pris. Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests with Morgan Paull playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests. Brion James portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat and laborer replicant, and Joanna Cassidy portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant.\n\nEdward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos drew on diverse ethnic sources to help create the fictional \"Cityspeak\" language his character uses in the film. His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, \"Horse dick [bullshit]! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner.\" M. Emmet Walsh portrays Captain Bryant, a rumpled, hard-drinking and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J. F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and he shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease. Joe Pantoliano had earlier been considered for the role. James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrayed the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis – in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott, whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.\n\n### Design\n\nScott credits Edward Hopper's painting Nighthawks and the French science fiction comics magazine Métal Hurlant, to which the artist Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud contributed, as stylistic mood sources. He also drew on the landscape of \"Hong Kong on a very bad day\" and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in northeast England. The visual style of the movie is influenced by the work of futurist Italian architect Antonio Sant'Elia. Scott hired Syd Mead as his concept artist; like Scott, he was influenced by Métal Hurlant. Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of Blade Runner, but he declined so that he could work on René Laloux's animated film Les Maîtres du temps – a decision that he later regretted. Production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film, and Mark Stetson served as chief model maker.\n\nBlade Runner has numerous similarities to Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building – the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runner's miniature building shots.\n\nThe extended end scene in the original theatrical release shows Rachael and Deckard traveling into daylight with pastoral aerial shots filmed by director Stanley Kubrick. Ridley Scott contacted Kubrick about using some of his surplus helicopter aerial photography from The Shining.\n\n#### Spinner\n\n\"Spinner\" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise much like vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. They are used extensively by the police as patrol cars, and wealthy people can also acquire spinner licenses. The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an aerodyne – a vehicle which directs air downward to create lift, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: \"conventional internal combustion, jet, and anti-gravity.\" A spinner is on permanent exhibit at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in Seattle, Washington. Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 vehicles by automobile customizer Gene Winfield; at least two were working ground vehicles, while others were light-weight mockups for crane shots and set decoration for street shots. Two of them ended up at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, but were later destroyed, and a few others remain in private collections.\n\n#### Voight-Kampff machine\n\nA very advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body. The bellows were designed for the latter function and give the machine the menacing air of a sinister insect. The VK is used primarily by Blade Runners to determine if a suspect is truly human by measuring the degree of his empathic response through carefully worded questions and statements.\n\nThe Voight-Kampff machine is a fictional interrogation tool, originating from the novel (where it is spelled \"Voigt-Kampff\"). The Voight-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by blade runners to determine whether an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement in response to questions dealing with empathy. \n\n### Music\n\nThe Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film noir retro-future envisioned by Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his Academy Award-winning score for Chariots of Fire, composed and performed the music on his synthesizers. He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator Demis Roussos. Another memorable sound is the tenor sax solo \"Love Theme\" by British saxophonist Dick Morrissey, who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used \"Memories of Green\" from the Vangelis album See You Later, an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film Someone to Watch Over Me.\n\nDespite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.\n\nThese delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many bootleg recordings over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 \"Off World Music, Ltd\" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994. A set with three CDs of Blade Runner-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled Blade Runner Trilogy, the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the film, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the film.\n\n### Special effects\n\nThe film's special effects are generally recognized to be among the best in the genre, using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest. Special effects engineers who worked on the film are often praised for the innovative technology they used to produce and design certain aspects of those visuals. In addition to matte paintings and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently motion controlled using computers. Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical run\n\nBlade Runner was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer Alan Ladd Jr. because his previous highest-grossing films (Star Wars and Alien) had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the 25th of the month his \"lucky day\". Blade Runner grossed reasonably good ticket sales in its opening weekend; earning $6.1 million during its first weekend in theaters. The film was released close to other major science-fiction and fantasy releases such as The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Conan the Barbarian and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which affected its commercial success.\n\n### Versions\n\nSeveral versions of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.\n\nTwo versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (117 minutes), known as the original version or Domestic Cut (released on Betamax, CED Videodisc and VHS in 1983, and on LaserDisc in 1987), and the International Cut (117 minutes), also known as the \"Criterion Edition\" or \"uncut version\", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S. and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video releases, the International Cut was later released on VHS and The Criterion Collection Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a \"10th Anniversary Edition\".\n\nRidley Scott's Director's Cut (1992, 116 minutes) had significant changes from the theatrical version including the removal of Deckard's voice-over, the re-insertion of a sequence in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn, and the removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the Director's Cut.\n\nIt is often falsely claimed that the unicorn sequence was an outtake from Ridley Scott's follow-up film Legend which also features unicorns, but it was in fact shot for Blade Runner as \"additional photography\" by second unit cinematographer Brian Tufano.\n\nScott's definitive The Final Cut (2007, 117 minutes) was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in December 2007. This is the only version over which Scott had complete artistic and editorial control.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 89% approval rating based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nInitial reactions among film critics were mixed. Some wrote that the plot took a back seat to the film's special effects and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action and adventure film. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time. Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace. Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it \"Blade Crawler\", and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as \"science fiction pornography\". Pauline Kael praised Blade Runner as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in \"human terms\". Ares magazine said, \"Misunderstood by audiences and critics alike, it is by far the best science fiction film of the year.\"\n\n### Cultural analysis\n\nAcademics began analyzing the film almost as soon as it was released. One of the first books on the film was Paul M. Sammon's Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner (1996), which dissects all the details concerning the film making. He was followed by Scott Bukatman's Blade Runner and other books and academic articles. In Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image, Décio Torres Cruz analyzes the philosophical and psychological issues and the literary influences in Blade Runner. He examines the film's cyberpunk and dystopic elements by establishing a link between the Biblical, classical and modern traditions and the postmodern aspects in the film's collage of several literary texts.\n\nThe boom in home video formats helped establish a growing cult around the film, which scholars have dissected for its dystopic aspects, questions regarding \"authentic\" humanity, ecofeminist aspects and use of conventions from multiple genres. Popular culture began to reassess its impact as a classic several years after it was released. Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original and the Director's Cut and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin. He later added The Final Cut to his \"Great Movies\" list. Critic Chris Rodley and Janet Maslin theorized that Blade Runner changed cinematic and cultural discourse through its image repertoire and subsequent influence on films. In 2012, Time film critic Richard Corliss surgically analyzed the durability, complexity, screenplay, sets and production dynamics from a personal, three-decade perspective. Denis Villeneuve, who directed the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, cites the film as a huge influence for him and many others.\n\nIt has also been noted for its postmodernist approach and that it contributes to the historical development of modern dystopia in film. Furthermore, the futuristic version of Los Angeles has been widely discussed by academics with some comparing it to Milton's descriptions of hell in Paradise Lost. A 2019 retrospective in the BBC argued that elements of the film's socio-political themes remained prescient in the real year of the film's setting, such as its depiction of climate change. From a more philosophical perspective, Alison Landsberg described Scott's direction of the film as a \"prosthetic memory\"—an action that has never happened and appears to be divorced from lived experience, yet it defines personhood and identity within the wider Blade Runner universe.\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nBlade Runner won or received nominations for the following awards:\n\n|   Year | Award                                | Category                         | Nominee                                                            | Result              |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n|  1982  | British Society of Cinematographers  | Best Cinematography              | Jordan Cronenweth                                                  | Nominated           |\n|  1982  | Los Angeles Film Critics Association | Best Cinematography              | Jordan Cronenweth                                                  | Won                 |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Cinematography              | Jordan Cronenweth                                                  | Won                 |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Costume Design              | Charles Knode and Michael Kaplan                                   | Won                 |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Editing                     | Terry Rawlings                                                     | Nominated           |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Film Music                  | Vangelis                                                           | Nominated           |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Makeup and Hair             | Marvin Westmore                                                    | Nominated           |\n|  1983  | British Academy Film Awards          | Best Production Design           | Lawrence G.

It employs some of the conventions of film noir, among them the character of a femme fatale; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); chiaroscuro cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook – extending to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of genetic engineering in the context of classical Greek drama and hubris. It also draws on Biblical images, such as Noah's flood, and literary sources, such as Frankenstein and William Blake. Although Scott said any similarity was merely coincidental, fans claimed that the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell was based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851.\n\nBlade Runner delves into the effects of technology on the environment and society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is represented in the \"retrofitted\" future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as \"extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel\". He also said that he \"liked the idea of exploring pain\" in the wake of his brother's death: \"When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.\"\n\nA sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades the world of the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored – especially regarding replicants' implanted memories. The film depicts a world post ecocide, where warfare and capitalism have led to destruction of 'normal' ecological systems. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand in hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to \"off-world\" (extraterrestrial) colonies. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question the nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it. The film also consists of themes of Japan as a power, coming amid a time of anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States.\n\nThese thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner's central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals – seemingly an essential indicator of one's \"humanity\". Replicants will not respond the same way humans would, showing a lack of concern. The film goes so far as to question if Deckard might be a replicant, in the process asking the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.\n\nThe question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release. Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human, while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity. Ridley Scott has stated that he envisaged Deckard as a replicant. Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, inserted into Scott's Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant – because Gaff could have retrieved Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted multiple interpretations.\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nWhile not initially a success with North American audiences, Blade Runner was popular internationally and garnered a cult following. The film's dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television programs. Its influence has also extended beyond the science fiction genre, especially in the creation of cinematic worlds. For example, Denis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo del Toro, Gareth Edwards, Rian Johnson, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick have all cited it as an influence. Nolan notes that he has seen Blade Runner \"literally hundreds of times\", while del Toro describes it as \"one of those cinematic drugs, that when I first saw it, I never saw the world the same way again.\"\n\nThe film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1993 and is frequently taught in university courses. In 2007, it was named the second-most visually influential film of all time by the Visual Effects Society. The film has also been the subject of parody, such as the comics Blade Bummer by Crazy comics, Bad Rubber by Steve Gallacci, and the Red Dwarf 2009 three-part miniseries \"Back to Earth\".\n\nBlade Runner continues to reflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell franchise, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering. The film is also considered to be one of the early examples of the tech noir subgenre.\n\nThe dialogue and music in Blade Runner has been sampled in music more than any other film of the 20th century. The 2009 album I, Human by Singaporean band Deus Ex Machina makes numerous references to the genetic engineering and cloning themes from the film, and even features a track titled \"Replicant\".\n\nBlade Runner is cited as a major influence on Warren Spector, designer of the video game Deus Ex, which displays evidence of the film's influence in both its visual rendering and plot. Indeed, the film's look – and in particular its overall darkness, preponderance of neon lights and opaque visuals – are easier to render than complicated backdrops, making it a popular reference point for video game designers. It has influenced adventure games such as the 2012 graphical text adventure Cypher, Rise of the Dragon, Snatcher, the Tex Murphy series, Beneath a Steel Sky, Flashback: The Quest for Identity, Bubblegum Crisis video games (and their original anime), the role-playing game Shadowrun, the first-person shooter Perfect Dark, the shooter game Skyhammer, and the Syndicate series of video games.\n\nThe logos of Atari, Bell, Coca-Cola, Cuisinart, Pan Am, and RCA, all market leaders at the time, were prominently displayed as product placement in the film, and all experienced setbacks after the film's release, leading to suggestions of a Blade Runner curse. Coca-Cola and Cuisinart recovered, and Tsingtao beer was also featured in the film and was more successful after the film than before.\n\nThe design of Tesla's Cybertruck was inspired by the film. Prior to its release Elon Musk promised that it would \"look like something out of Blade Runner\". Besides referring to the truck as the \"Blade Runner Truck\", Musk chose to debut the truck in order to coincide with the film's setting of November 2019. The film's art designer Syd Mead praised the truck and said he was \"flattered\" by the homage to Blade Runner.\n\n### Media recognition\n\n|   Year  | Presenter                               | Title                                                                             | Rank    | Refs            |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|\n|   2001  | The Village Voice                       | 100 Best Films of the 20th Century                                                | 94      | [197]           |\n|   2002  | Online Film Critics Society (OFCS)      | Top 100 Sci-fi Films of the Past 100 Years                                        | 2       | [198]           |\n|   2002  | Sight &amp; Sound                           | Sight &amp; Sound Top Ten Poll 2002                                                   | 45      | [199]           |\n|   2002  | 50 Klassiker, Film                      | 50 Klassiker, Film                                                                | —       | [200]           |\n|   2003  | 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die | 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die                                           | —       | [201]           |\n|   2003  | Entertainment Weekly                    | The Top 50 Cult Movies                                                            | 9       | [202]           |\n|   2004  | The Guardian, scientists                | Top 10 Sci-fi Films of All Time                                                   | 1       | [203][204][205] |\n|   2005  | Total Film's editors                    | 100 Greatest Movies of All Time                                                   | 47      | [206]           |\n|   2005  | Time magazine's critics                 | \"All-Time 100\" Movies                                                             | —       | [207][208][209] |\n|   2008  | New Scientist                           | All-time favorite science fiction film (readers and staff)                        | 1       | [210][211]      |\n|   2008  | Empire                                  | The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time                                               | 20      | [212]           |\n|   2010  | Total Film                              | 100 Greatest Movies of All Time                                                   | —       | [213]           |\n|   2012  | Sight &amp; Sound                           | Sight &amp; Sound 2012 critics top 250 films                                          | 69      | [214]           |\n|   2012  | Sight &amp; Sound                           | Sight &amp; Sound 2012 directors top 100 films                                        | 67      | [215]           |\n|   2017  | Empire                                  | The 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time                                               | 13      | [216]           |\n|   2022  | IGN                                     | Top 25 Sci-Fi Movies of All Time                                                  | 2       | [217]           |\n|   2022  | Sight &amp; Sound                           | Sight &amp; Sound 2022 critics top 100 films                                          | 54      | [218]           |\n|   2024  | Far Out Magazine                        | 10 most accurate movie psychopaths according to the FBI (replicant Leon Kowalski) | 8       | [219]           |\n\n#### American Film Institute recognition\n\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills – No. 74\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – No. 97\n- AFI's 10 Top 10 – No. 6 Science Fiction Film\n\n### In other media\n\nBefore filming began, Cinefantastique magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write a special issue about Blade Runner's production which became the book Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner. The book chronicles Blade Runner's evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer Alan Ladd, Jr. has said, \"Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it.\" Future Noir has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences as well as photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of Future Noir was published in 2007, and additional materials not in either print edition have been published online.\n\nPhilip K. Dick refused a $400,000 offer to write a Blade Runner novelization, saying: \"⁠[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience\" and it \"would have probably been disastrous to me artistically\". He added, \"That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization – they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles.\" Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was eventually reprinted as a tie-in, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title. Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled Blade Runner: A Story of the Future by Les Martin was released in 1982. Archie Goodwin scripted the comic book adaptation, A Marvel Comics Super Special: Blade Runner, published in September 1982, which was illustrated by Al Williamson, Carlos Garzon, Dan Green, and Ralph Reese, and lettered by Ed King.\n\nBlue Dolphin Enterprises published the film's screenplay combined with selected production storyboards as The Illustrated Blade Runner (June 1982); a book of original production artwork by Syd Mead, Mentor Huebner, Charles Knode, Michael Kaplan, and Ridley Scott as Blade Runner Sketchbook (1982); and The Blade Runner Portfolio (1982), a collection of twelve photographic prints, similar to the artist portfolios released by their Schanes & Schanes imprint.\n\nThere are two video games based on the film, both titled Blade Runner: one from 1985, a side-scrolling video game for Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC by CRL Group PLC, which is marked as \"a video game interpretation of the film score by Vangelis\" rather than of the film itself (due to licensing issues); and another from 1997, a point-and-click adventure for PC by Westwood Studios. The 1997 game has a non-linear plot based in the Blade Runner world, non-player characters that each ran in their own independent AI, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of voxel elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, J. F. Sebastian and Howie Lee appear, and their voice files are recorded by the original actors, with the exception of Gaff, who is replaced by Javier Grajeda (as Victor Gardell) and Howie Lee, who is replaced by Toru Nagai.\n\nThe television film (and later series) Total Recall 2070 was initially planned as a spin-off of the film Total Recall (based on Philip K. Dick's short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\"), but was produced as a hybrid of Total Recall and Blade Runner. Many similarities between Total Recall 2070 and Blade Runner were noted, as well as apparent influences on the show from Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel and the TV series Holmes & Yoyo.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nThe film has been the subject of several documentaries.\n\n## Sequel and related media\n\nA sequel was released in 2017, titled Blade Runner 2049, with Ryan Gosling alongside Ford in the starring roles. It entered production in mid-2016 and is set decades after the first film. Harrison Ford reprised his role as Rick Deckard. The film won two Academy Awards, for cinematography and visual effects.\n\nThe world of Blade Runner has also come to be explored in animation. Blade Runner 2049 was preceded by the release of three short films that served as prequels, where the chronological first, Blade Runner Black Out 2022, was anime (the other two, 2036: Nexus Dawn and 2048: Nowhere to Run, were live action, not animated).\n\nIn November 2021, a Japanese-American anime television series called Blade Runner: Black Lotus was released. The series tells the story of a female replicant protagonist, rather than that of a male Blade Runner one.\n\nDick's friend K. W. Jeter wrote three authorized Blade Runner novels that continue Rick Deckard's story, attempting to resolve the differences between the film and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. These are Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995), Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night (1996), and Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon (2000).\n\nBlade Runner co-writer David Peoples wrote the 1998 action film Soldier, which he referred to as a \"sidequel\" or spiritual successor to the original film; the two are set in a shared universe. A bonus feature on the Blu-ray for Prometheus, the 2012 film by Scott set in the Alien universe, states that Eldon Tyrell, CEO of the Blade Runner Tyrell Corporation, was the mentor of Guy Pearce's character Peter Weyland.\n\nIn late 2022, Amazon announced a Blade Runner 2049 sequel series would be produced. On October 12, 2022, an apparent official approval to actually make a Blade Runner 2099 TV series was reported.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while incorporating the specified XML tags to highlight the relevant attributes of the movie recommendation.",

It revolves around \"present-day\" contract killers called \"loopers\" whose targets are sent back through time by criminal syndicates from the future.\n\nLooper was selected as the opening film of the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on September 28, 2012, by TriStar Pictures.[5][6] The film  received critical acclaim and was a box office success, grossing $176 million worldwide on a $30 million budget.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2044, 25-year-old Joe works for a Kansas City crime syndicate as an assassin or \"looper\". Since tracking systems in the future of 2074 have made it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies undetected, the syndicate sends its enemies back in time to be executed. Managed by a man from the future named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of victims whose faces are concealed, recovering silver bars attached to their targets as payment. To hide connections to the syndicate, any loopers who survive until 2074 are sent back and killed by their own younger selves, referred to as \"closing the loop\". These targets are identified by gold bars instead of silver, marking the end of the looper's contract.\n\nJoe's friend Seth comes to see him after Seth fails to kill his future self. Old Seth escaped after warning Seth that a person called \"The Rainmaker\" would overthrow the five, major bosses and close all loops. Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment's floor safe, but later reveals Seth's location after Abe threatens to confiscate half of Joe's saved silver. Abe's elite \"Gat Men\" capture Seth, carve an address into his arm, and begin severing his body parts. These effects appear on Old Seth's body. He then goes to the address on his arm and is killed by Kid Blue, one of the Gat Men.\n\nWhen Joe's next target arrives, it is his older self, but with his face uncovered and hands unbound. Old Joe knocks him out and escapes. Returning to his apartment and finding it ransacked by the Gat Men, Joe fights with Kid Blue, falls off a fire escape, and blacks out.\n\nIn another timeline, Joe does kill his older self. He moves to Shanghai, but burns through his funds in six years, due to his drug addiction and wild party life. Broke, he becomes a hitman. Seventeen years later, he marries and breaks the addiction with his wife's help. Seven years after that, his wife is killed when Joe is taken to close the loop. Overpowering his captors, Old Joe sends himself back to 2044, altering his history by evading Joe and escaping.\n\nOld Joe experiences vague memories of Joe's actions in the present and meets his younger self at a diner. He wants to save his wife by killing The Rainmaker as a child. He acquires a map from a local library using numbers written on his hand that supposedly pertain to the Rainmaker's identity. Kid Blue and the Gat Men appear, and a gunfight ensues. Both Joes escape with pieces of the map.\n\nJoe follows the map to a farm where a woman named Sara lives with her young son Cid. Sara recognizes the numbers on the map as Cid's birthday and the location of the hospital where he was born. Joe deduces that Old Joe plans to kill all three children who were born at that hospital on the same day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker.\n\nJesse, a Gat Man, comes to the farm, but Cid helps Joe hide. Later that night, Sara and Joe have sex, and Sara reveals that while she has above-average telekinetic powers, Cid's abilities are far stronger. In the morning, Joe wakes to find Jesse holding Sara at gunpoint. Cid kills Jesse using telekinesis. Joe realizes that Cid will become The Rainmaker and that Old Joe will now know this.\n\nKid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe. Old Joe breaks free, killing Abe and his henchmen, and goes to Sara's farm, followed by Kid Blue. While Joe kills Kid Blue, Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid. When Cid's face is grazed by a bullet, Sara calms him before he can react and kill anyone. She sends Cid into a sugarcane field and positions herself to block Old Joe's line of fire. Joe realizes that if Old Joe kills Sara, an orphaned, traumatized Cid with lethal powers will grow up to become The Rainmaker. So, Joe kills himself, erasing Old Joe's existence, saving Sara and potentially preventing Cid from becoming The Rainmaker.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe\n    - Bruce Willis as Old Joe\n- Emily Blunt as Sara\n- Paul Dano as Seth\n    - Frank Brennan as Old Seth\n- Noah Segan as Kid Blue\n- Piper Perabo as Suzie\n- Jeff Daniels as Abe\n- Pierce Gagnon as Cid\n- Summer Qing as Joe's Wife\n- Tracie Thoms as Beatrix\n- Garret Dillahunt as Jesse\n- Nick Gomez as Dale\n\n## Production\n\n### Development and casting\n\nFilm set diner constructed for the film in Assumption Parish, Louisiana\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRian Johnson and Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaking at WonderCon 2012 in promotion of Looper\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLooper was written and directed by Rian Johnson, originally conceived as a short film starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, shortly after making Brick, Johnson's first feature.[7] After Johnson released The Brothers Bloom in 2008, he re-teamed with producer Ram Bergman, who produced Johnson's previous two films, with the goal of starting production of Looper in 2009.[8] In May 2010, Gordon-Levitt was cast in one of the lead roles, which he would play after completing Premium Rush.[9] Later in the month, Bruce Willis was also cast.[10] In the following October, Emily Blunt joined Gordon-Levitt and Willis.[11] Noah Segan, Jeff Daniels and Piper Perabo were cast in January 2011.[12]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming began in Louisiana on January 24, 2011.[13][verification needed]\n\nMakeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji created the prosthetics that Gordon-Levitt wore in the film so that he would physically resemble Willis.[14]\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nathan Johnson, Rian Johnson's cousin.[15]\n\n### Post-production\n\nTalking about Looper and time travel in film, Rian Johnson said:\n\nEven though it's a time-travel movie, the pleasure of it doesn't come from the mass of time travel. It's not a film like Primer, for instance, where the big part of the enjoyment is kind of working out all the intricacies of it. For Looper, I very much wanted it to be a more character-based movie that is more about how these characters dealt with the situation time travel has brought about. So the biggest challenge was figuring out how to not spend the whole movie explaining the rules and figure out how to put it out there in a way that made sense on some intuitive level for the audience; then get past it and deal with the real meat of the story.[15]\n\nOther influences cited by Rian Johnson include The Terminator, Witness, Akira,[16] Domu: A Child's Dream,[17] 12 Monkeys, Timecrimes, and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World.[18]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nLooper premiered on September 6, 2012, at the opening night of the Toronto International Film Festival.[19] The film was then released theatrically in the United States on September 28, 2012,[20] by FilmDistrict, who obtained the domestic rights from production company Endgame Entertainment at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In turn, FilmDistrict chose to release the film with Sony Pictures, over their genre label TriStar Pictures.[21]\n\nThe Chinese release of the film reintegrates a substantial number of scenes set in Shanghai. The move was requested by Chinese production company DMG Entertainment in order to further appeal to Chinese audiences. Several of these scenes were shortened or cut for the American release.[22]\n\nJohnson released a free audio commentary on SoundCloud (which was heavily requested after making one for The Brothers Bloom) to be downloaded and listened to during the film, with the warning: \"Needless to say, this is NOT to be listened to on a first viewing, or before you've seen the film.\"[citation needed]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray and DVD[23] in North America on December 31, 2012.[24] The film was also released on January 28, 2013, in online UK stores, with a general release on February 4, 2013. The film made $20,583,583 in domestic DVD sales and $11,468,974 from domestic Blu-ray sales for a total of $32,052,557.[25][26] The film was remastered for an Ultra HD Blu-ray release in 2021.[27]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nLooper opened on September 28, 2012, in 2,992 theaters in North America and grossed $20,801,522 in its opening weekend averaging $6,952 per theater and ranking #2 at the box office. The widest release of the film in the U.S was 2,993 theaters and it ended up earning $66.5 million domestically and $110 million internationally for a total of $176.5 million, against its $30 million production budget.[28]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 275 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"As thought-provoking as it is thrilling, Looper delivers an uncommonly smart, bravely original blend of futuristic sci-fi and good old-fashioned action.\"[29] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[30] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[31]\n\nJames Mottram of Total Film gave Looper 5 stars out of 5, concluding that it was \"the best sci-fi movie since Moon. The best time-travel yarn since 12 Monkeys. And one of the best films of 2012.\"[32]\n\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it \"an engaging, neatly worked-out time-travel sci-fi thriller\", but also criticizing the effects involved in making Gordon-Levitt resemble Willis: \"At first, the effect is a bit odd, and you can't quite put your finger on what's off; then it feels downright weird to be looking at a version of Gordon-Levitt who is no longer the actor you've known for a few years now.\"[33]\n\nPeter Debruge of Variety also gave the film a positive review, writing that writer-director Johnson's \"grandly conceived, impressively mounted third feature shows a giddy, geeky interest in science-fiction, then forces it into the back seat and lets the multidimensional characters drive. In a genre infamous for loose ends, this thinking man's thriller marshals action, romance and a dose of very dark comedy toward a stunning payoff.\"[34]\n\nKim Newman of Empire magazine gave Looper 5 stars out of 5, writing, \"Intelligent science-fiction sometimes seems an endangered species—too much physics and there's a risk of creating something cold and remote, too many explosions and get lost in the multiplex. Looper isn't perfect, but it pulls off the full Wizard Of Oz: it has a brain, courage and a heart.\"[35] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the film an A− grade, writing, \"Looper is a remarkable feat of imagination and execution, entertaining from start to finish, even as it asks the audience to contemplate how and why humanity keeps making the same rotten mistakes.\"[36] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, writing, \"Looper is way inventive but it wears its creativity lightly, like it's no big deal. This is a highflying, super-stylish science-fiction thriller that brings a fresh approach to mind-bending genre material. We're not always sure where this time-travel film is going, but we wouldn't dream of abandoning the ride.\"[37]\n\nClaudia Puig of USA Today gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing, \"Looper's heady blend of time travel, gritty action and a jot of romance is such a thrilling and cerebral mind-bender that it will likely have moviegoers gathering outside the theater afterward to hash out details of its intricately constructed universe. Not that that's a bad thing.\"[38] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising the performances of Willis and Gordon-Levitt and concluding, \"Lacing tremendously exciting action with touching gravity, Looper hits you like a shot in the heart.\"[39] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising its screenplay, stating \"Looper, a smart and tricky sci-fi story, sidesteps the paradoxes of time travel by embracing them. Most time travel movies run into trouble in the final scenes, when impossibilities pile up one upon another. This film leads to a startling conclusion that wipes out the story's paradoxes so neatly it's as if it never happened.\"[40]\n\nLisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ grade, writing, \"The time swivels in Looper evoke some of Inception's fancy temporal tricks (some of which, of course, also involved Gordon-Levitt straddling multiple time zones at once). But it's the glimpses of Children of Men-like societal dystopia that give the movie its real weight\".[41] Keith Staskiewicz, also writing for Entertainment Weekly (reviewing the DVD) and also giving a \"B+\", said, \"The film's premise is markedly inventive, and [writer-director Rian] Johnson spends a lot of time making his universe seem lived-in and believable, but he's not just concerned with whiz-bang what-ifs. The showdown of selves illuminates just how little Gordon-Levitt's character has changed over the intervening years, stuck as he is in a feedback loop of drug use and violence despite his pipe dream of moving to Europe. The retro trench coats and firearms also suggest a sort of eternal recurrence, and as Looper's plot gets more complex, its central question simplifies: If we can't fix our mistakes, can we at least make sure we don't repeat the same ones over and over again?\"[42]\n\nRichard Corliss of Time magazine gave the film a positive review, calling Looper a \"hybrid, mashing Quentin Tarantino and Philip K. Dick into a species of pulp science fiction\" and also writing, \"A fanciful film with the patina of hyper-realism, Looper is well served by actors who behave not as if they were dropped carelessly into the future but spent their whole desperate lives there.\"[43] Dana Stevens of Slate gave the film a mixed review, writing, \"Looper felt to me like a maddening near-miss: It posits an impossible but fascinating-to-imagine relationship – a face-to-face encounter between one's present and future self, in which each self must account for its betrayal of the other – and then throws away nearly all the dramatic potential that relationship offers.\"[44]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                                                                                | Nominees      | Result    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|\n| National Board of Review Award for Best Original Screenplay[45]                                      | Rian Johnson  | Won       |\n| Washington D.C.

There are three things that impressed me the most about this movie: 1. The cute face and hairstyle of little girl Yingzi, and her eyes are full of innocence. 2. The theme music that always appears at the right time, revealing a touch of parting emotion. 3. The slow-paced way of life in old Beijing. For example, camels and donkeys are used as means of transportation, to dig well water, etc. Everything is the real memory of little girl Yingzi, through her innocent eyes observation, it is really full of emotion, as if it is an unreal past. But I know that those people and things did exist. The good thing is that the little girl doesn't distinguish between good and bad, so she can get close to many people. Now we are all good at value judgment and moral judgment, and it is difficult to be a quiet observer like her. 'Let the past thing pass'. This is one of lines. With the lyrics of the theme music, life seems to be constantly saying goodbye to people and things in the past. Both unpleasant and beautiful things will gradually leave us. What a sadness feeling at last.",

Cooke’s supernatural family novel The Lighthouse Witches is set to be adapted into a television series after Studiocanal and The Picture Company landed the rights to the book.\n\nThe two companies closed the rights to the book and are currently packaging the series.\n\nPublished last year by Penguin Random House, the book follows young mother Liv and her three daughters who arrive on a mysterious Scottish island to run a decrepit lighthouse.\n\nWhen single mother Liv is commissioned to paint a mural in a 100-year-old lighthouse on a remote Scottish island, it’s an opportunity to start over with her three daughters–Luna, Sapphire, and Clover. When two of her daughters go missing, she’s frantic. She learns that the cave beneath the lighthouse was once a prison for women accused of witchcraft. The locals warn her about wildlings, supernatural beings who mimic human children, created by witches for revenge. Liv is told wildlings are dangerous and must be killed.\n\nRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNews\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStudiocanal Boards Thomas Vinterberg's 'Families Like Ours'\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tFestivals\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBusan Film Festival Puts Programmer Jung Han-seok In Pole Position For Director Role\n\nTwenty-two years later, Luna has been searching for her missing sisters and mother. When she receives a call about her youngest sister, Clover, she’s initially ecstatic. Clover is the sister she remembers–except she’s still seven years old, the age she was when she vanished. Luna is worried Clover is a wildling. Luna has few memories of her time on the island, but she’ll have to return to find the truth of what happened to her family. But she doesn’t realize just how much the truth will change her.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe series will blend genre elements with a supernatural family drama spanning multiple generations.\n\nThe Picture Company co-founders Andrew Rona and Alex Heineman will executive produce the series with Studiocanal’s Ron Halpern and Shana Eddy overseeing the production for the studio. It was brought in by Studiocanal’s Leena Lancashire Iglesias.\n\nThe move comes after The Picture Company and Studiocanal reupped their multi-year deal to make a number of films per year. Part of the deal sees the two companies move into TV – they are already working on a series adaptation of the Johnnie To action thriller Drug War, with Jett’s Sebastian Gutierrez attached.\n\nCooke said, “From the minute I met both Alex and Andrew and the team at Studiocanal I felt I had found the absolute dream team for the small-screen adaptation of The Lighthouse Witches. Andrew and Alex have an exciting vision for the series, and StudioCanal is the gold standard for me when it comes to TV and film production. I’m confident that this adaptation will be everything that readers of the book are eager for, and I am hugely excited for it.”\n\nThe deal was brokered by Luke Speed on behalf of Alice Lutyens of the Curtis Brown Group.\n\n## Must Read Stories\n\n- ‘Novocaine’ At $8M+ Leads Year’s Lowest-Grossing Frame To Date\n- ‘Bachelor’ Showrunners Exiting Franchise Amid “Toxic” Workplace Allegations\n- Season 4 A Go With Jason Sudeikis &amp;amp; Women’s Team; Series Heads To Kansas\n- ‘Wicked’, ‘Emilia Pérez’ &amp;amp; ‘Wild Robot’ Among ACE Eddie Winners\n\n## Read More About:\n\n- Breaking News\n- Development\n- StudioCanal\n- The Picture Company\n\n## Subscribe to Deadline\n\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n\n## No Comments\n\nLoading comments...\n\n## Sidebar\n\n### Trending on Deadline\n\n- 1\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Snow White' Red Carpet Photos: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, Marc Platt, Bob Iger &amp;amp; More\n- 2\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tZZ Top Drummer Frank Beard Leaves Tour To Focus On \"Health Issue\"\n- 3\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUtah's Hopes Of Keeping Sundance Threatened By Anti-Pride Flag Bill On Governor's Desk\n- 4\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChildren's &amp;amp; Family Emmy Winners List: Meryl Streep, 'Percy Jackson' Among Awardees\n- 5\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBeth Behrs \"Grateful\" To CBS \"For Chance To Say Goodbye\" To 'The Neighborhood': \"Kat Dennings &amp;amp; I Never Got An End To Our '2 Broke Girls' Story\"\n- 6\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Novocaine' With $8M+ Leads Lowest-Grossing Weekend Of 2025 To Date - Box Office\n- 7\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScarlett Johansson On Getting Pressured To Join Social Media To Promote Projects: \"I Think The Film Will Do Fine\"\n- 8\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Voice Of America Is Being Silenced\": Director Speaks Out After Trump Starts Dismantling U.S.-Funded Broadcast Entities\n- 9\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJenna Ortega Reflects On Early Acting Role In 'Iron Man 3' Where Her Lines Were Cut: \"I Count That, Then I Move On\"\n- 10\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWill Smith's First Album In 20 Years Gets Release Date\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts &amp; Newsletters\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

The \"plot twist\" in the third act MIGHT otherwise be clever if it were not for all the illogical (and impossible) convolutions and contrivances throughout the movie. Then when that plot twist smacks you in the face ... and you look back and put it in context with one ludicrous scene after another that you already watched -- you want to grab the screenwriter by the scruff of the neck and demand that he/she never, ever, EVER write anything ever again!\n\nI really WANTED to like this movie. From what I've heard about Jason Momoa offscreen, he's supposed to be a pretty good guy. Plus, I'm a Pittsburgh kid, born &amp; raised. The glamour shots of my city were nice to watch -- until it was all sodomized by this inane script!\n\n- knuckles-10\n- Sep 19, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ14\n\n- How long is Sweet Girl?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 20, 2021 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Official Netflix\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Cô Gái Ngọt Ngào\n- Filming locations\n    - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA\n- Production companies\n    - ASAP Entertainment\n    - On The Roam\n    - Pride of Gypsies\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 50 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Granted, it's no masterpiece. The plot isn't particularly innovative, and the dialog is clunky at times. Perhaps most disturbing of all, since director Clive Donner had been a top editor during the preceding decade, the pacing is too slow. (This kind of movie shouldn't run longer than 85 or 90 minutes.) But it's thoughtful and entertaining. And most importantly, it's an excellent example of the transition that the British film industry was undergoing in the late-1950s. On one hand, its characters are working-class types who feel entrapped by their environment, much like the \"Kitchen Sink\" dramas that began appearing the following year. Likewise, Donner's interest in youth culture and on-location photography mirrors that of the Free Cinema directors. On the other hand, the moral compass of \"The Secret Place\" is aligned with the moderate views of Ealing, and poor Belinda Lee is saddled with outdated lines like \"you really *must* stop\" and \"I'd be ever so grateful.\" (By the way, the gorgeous Lee acquits herself nicely in this rare dramatic role. She was used rather poorly by the Rank Organization.)\n\nWhat I especially like about \"The Secret Place\" is its blending of genres. At its most basic level, it's a heist picture. The plot centers around a daring diamond robbery. The second half of the film, however, runs more along the lines of a boys' adventure tale, with young Freddie trying to foil the gang's plans -- not unlike Ealing's \"Hue and Cry\" (though with far less comedy). Yet the movie also presents us with a vivid and dramatic portrayal of a bombed-out London neighborhood and the interconnected lives of its inhabitants -- much like \"It Always Rains on Sunday\" and \"London Belongs to Me.\" At heart, this film wants to say something about the bleakness of war-scarred London and the need its younger inhabitants have of escape to a better life. A brief interlude that occurs when Molly and Gerry visit a modern flat they hope to buy with their share of the loot provides subtle but beautiful motivation for their actions.\n\nAs the other reviewer points out, most viewers will be interested to see a very young David McCallum in one of his earliest roles, and as I've already mentioned, this movie offers a rare glimpse of Belinda Lee tackling a role that wasn't beneath her. But the real eye-opener is Michael Brooke's superb performance as the adolescent Freddie, whose crush on Molly is exploited cruelly by the gang. Donner's skill with young actors is on full display here: Brooke's depiction of pubescent infatuation with a (slightly) older woman and the heartbreak and loss of innocence that that sort of infatuation can result in is spot-on. Freddie is both precocious and naive -- a combination that's extraordinarily difficult to recreate. It really is one of the best and most overlooked child performances of the decade. It's a shame that Brooke didn't have much of a career afterward. (By the way, IMDb's entry for Brooke apparently confuses him with a much older actor with the same name. Surely, he wasn't born in 1904! However, I know that I've glimpsed him in a couple of other British films from the same period -- \"The Mudlark\" and \"The Long Arm,\" most notably.)\n\nSo if you get a chance to watch this on TV, it's worth your while. (It seems to come on TCM once every year or so.)\n\n- Tryavna\n- Aug 1, 2007\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 27, 1957 (Denmark)\n- Country of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Am Rande der Unterwelt\n- Filming locations\n    - Tom Thumb's Arch underline railway bridge, Mostyn Grove, Bow East, London, England, UK(The place where Molly meets Gerry to tell him she has failed to recover the stolen diamonds from Freddie Haywood.

I'm hooked! Suspenseful, thrilling, funny, and sooooo many twists. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I kept saying ok, just one more episode and then I'm going to bed. But of course I ended up watching the entire season in one sitting. It was so freaking good! Last episode was such a cliffhanger so now I know there will definitely be a season 2 and I cannot freaking wait. Y'all, Seriously this is the best show I've watched in years. Please go watch it now. I promise you won't regret it.

This music quickly signals that this will be a story that tips toward the horror genre, told through a Black lens.",

The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Ruth Wilson, Will Poulter and Charlotte Rampling. Set in 1948, the plot follows a doctor who visits an old house where his mother used to work, only to discover it may hold a dark secret. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2018 and in the United States on 31 August 2018 by Focus Features, receiving positive reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1940s Warwickshire, Dr. Faraday is called to visit a sick maid at the dilapidated Hundreds Hall. The maid confesses to faking and hopes the doctor will send her home. The Hall now belongs to Roderick Ayres, a scarred Royal Air Force veteran severely burned in the Second World War, who is being nursed by his sister, Caroline. Dr. Faraday recalls during his childhood in 1919 visiting the house, where his beloved mother had once been a maid to the grand Ayres family. He once broke an acorn from an elaborate plaster carving, to his mother's anger, in view of young Susan, the Ayres' first daughter, known as Suki.\n\nThere are intermittent noises occurring in the house, alarming Caroline, Mrs. Ayres and the maid. The servants' bells sound without anyone ringing them. A 19th century tube communication device linking the empty nursery to the kitchen also begins to sound inexplicably. When Mrs. Ayres goes upstairs to investigate, she is suddenly locked in the nursery. Experiencing shadowy figures and strange banging noises, Mrs. Ayres, in a frantic attempt to escape, breaks the windows, cutting both arms. After the others in the household rescue her from the room, she comes to believe that Suki's ghost is always nearby.\n\nNot long afterwards, Mrs. Ayres kills herself by slashing her wrists with the glass from a broken picture frame. Roderick attends the funeral, admonishing Caroline to leave the house lest she might be the next to die. On the night of the funeral, Faraday and a reluctant Caroline make plans to marry in six weeks' time. Later, Faraday considers that the strange occurrences in the house may well be due to poltergeist activity. It is suggested that supernatural phenomena might be the product of random, unintended telekinesis, which may well be poltergeist-like activity caused by a living person (as opposed to a dead one).\n\nCaroline eventually breaks off her engagement to Dr.\nFaraday, insisting that she would not be happy married to him, and expressing her intention to sell Hundreds Hall. Faraday insists that she is merely exhausted and not thinking clearly.\n\nOne night, Faraday has a house call that keeps him off-premises. When he finally arrives home, he learns that Caroline has fallen from the second floor to her death.\n\nAt the inquest into Caroline's death, the maid reports that she awoke to hear Caroline going upstairs to investigate a strange noise in the hall. She also reports hearing Caroline cry out \"You!,\" immediately before falling to her death. After Dr. Faraday testifies that Caroline's mind was undoubtedly \"clouded,\" the coroner declares the death to be a suicide. The court concurs.\n\nMonths later, Faraday visits the Ayres home while it is up for sale, having kept the keys which Caroline gave him. As he leaves the premises, the lifelike spectre of a young Faraday standing at the top of the staircase (where Caroline fell) solemnly watches him before backing away into the darkness.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Domhnall Gleeson as Dr. Faraday\n- Ruth Wilson as Caroline Ayres\n- Will Poulter as Roderick Ayres\n- Liv Hill as Betty\n- Charlotte Rampling as Mrs Ayres\n- Harry Hadden-Paton as Dr David Granger\n- Anna Madeley as Anne Granger\n- Richard McCabe as Dr Seeley\n\nOther notable actors who appear in the film in minor roles include Sarah Crowden, Elizabeth Counsell, Clive Francis, Kate Phillips, Oliver Chris, Nicholas Burns, Charlie Anson, Josh Dylan, Lloyd Hutchinson, Lorne MacFadyen, Maggie McCarthy, Ann Firbank and Camilla Arfwedson, with child actors Oliver Zetterstrom and Tipper Seifert-Cleveland also appearing in the film as young Dr. Faraday and Susan \"Sukie\" Ayres, respectively.\n\n## Production\n\nIn September 2015, it was announced that Lenny Abrahamson would direct an adaptation of Sarah Waters' supernatural drama novel The Little Stranger, scripted by Lucinda Coxon, in which Domhnall Gleeson would play the lead role of Dr Faraday.[4] On 5 May 2017, Ruth Wilson was reportedly cast as the female lead.[5] On 23 May 2017, Focus Features acquired the worldwide distribution rights to the film, excluding four territories: France and Switzerland, where Pathé would be distributing, and the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom where 20th Century Fox would be distributing for Pathé. Will Poulter and Charlotte Rampling were also cast in the film, which was produced by Egan, Andrea Calderwood and Ed Guiney. The film was developed by Potboiler Productions, Film4 Productions, Element and Dark Trick.[6]\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on 6 July 2017 in the UK and took place in different locations outside London, including Winslow in Buckinghamshire and Yorkshire, for about ten weeks.[7]\n\n## Theatrical run\n\nThe film was released in the United States on 31 August 2018[8] and in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2018.[9]\n\nIn its opening weekend in the United States, the film made $417,000 from 474 cinemas, an average of $880 per venue.[10] In its opening weekend in the UK and Ireland, it grossed £294,900 from 296 sites, an average of under £1,000 per cinema.[11]\n\n## Reception\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Little Stranger's reliance on atmosphere may satisfy audiences in the mood for sophisticated horror fare — while frustrating those seeking more visceral thrills.\"[12] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[13]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Lodderhose, Diana (23 May 2017). \"Focus Features Acquires Lenny Abrahamson's 'The Little Stranger' – Cannes\".

[1][2][3]\n\n## Plot\n\nAt the start of the book, a man awakes in a forest, suffering from memory loss, and calling for someone named Anna. He can't remember his own name and has no memories of anything before waking. He finds his way to a manor, where associates tell him that he is a doctor called Sebastian Bell who is attending a party thrown by the Hardcastles, the family of Blackheath Manor. After he falls asleep that night, he awakes to find himself in the body of the butler, and it is the morning of the previous day.\n\nHe learns that his real name is Aiden Bishop and that he has eight days inhabiting eight different party guests, or “hosts,” to solve the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle, which will take place at 11pm at the party that evening. He is only allowed to leave Blackheath once he finds the killer. If he is unable to solve the mystery in the eight allocated days, the process will restart and he will awake again in the body of Sebastian Bell with his memory wiped. He also learns that there are two other people competing to discover the identity of the murderer, and that only one person will be permitted to leave Blackheath.\n\n## Title\n\nAccording to Turton, the novel's title was changed in America since it was similar to the previously published The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.[4]\n\n## Reception\n\nThe Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle reached number one on The Saturday Times Bestseller list and number five on The Sunday Times Bestseller list, earning critical acclaim.[5]\n\nThe Guardian's review said \"With time loops, body swaps and a psychopathic footman, this is a dazzling take on the murder mystery\",[2] while The Times said \"The plot of this complex, fascinating and bewildering murder-mystery is impossible to summarise\" and called it \"an astonishingly polished debut\".[3]\n\n### Awards\n\nThe Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle won the Best First Novel prize in the 2018 Costa Book Awards[6] and Best Novel in the 2018 Books Are My Bag Readers' Awards,[7] as voted for by booksellers. In the same year, it was shortlisted for a New Writers' Award at the Specsavers National Book Awards,[8] Debut of the Year at The British Book Awards,[9]  and longlisted for a New Blood Dagger and Gold Dagger at the CWA Awards.[10] Val McDermid selected Stuart Turton, author of The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, to appear on her prestigious New Blood panel at the Theakstons Old Peculiar Crime Writing Festival.[11] In 2019, it was shortlisted for Best Debut Novel at the Strand Magazine Critics Awards[12] and longlisted for The Glass Bell Award.[13] In 2021, the Japanese edition of the novel, translated by Kazuyo Misumi and published in 2019, was shortlisted for the Best Translated Honkaku Mystery of the Decade (2010-2019).[14]\n\n## Adaptation\n\nIn December 2020 it was announced that Netflix had bought the rights to a seven-part series adaptation of the novel produced by House Productions, who had acquired the television rights in 2018, to be written by Sophie Petzal.[15] On January 17, 2023, it was reported that after two years of development, Netflix had cancelled the planned series.[16]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Costa Book Awards\".

I will say it keeps you guessing, and there are a few twists.\n\nHowever, at the very end, there is one twist too many.\n\nAlso, I think people were misled and upended by what it was they were watching.

I won't rehash the plot. I will say it keeps you guessing, and there are a few twists. However, at the very end, there is one twist too many. Also, I think people were misled and upended by what it was they were watching. They were expecting one genre, and it started that way - then it turned into another genre, and the people watching weren't necessarily fans of the second genre. Behind Her Eyes has very nice production values and good-looking people. The story could have been much stronger, and as far as the \"twists,\" they should have quit while they were ahead.\n            </Content>\n        </Review>\n    </UserReviews>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information clearly while applying the appropriate XML tags to highlight the relevant attributes.

Two weeks earlier, Owen, an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his divorcing parents, sees a barefoot little girl named Abby and an older man moving in next door. At school, a teenage bully named Kenny and two of his friends constantly terrorize Owen, who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth. Abby encourages him to retaliate, and pledges to protect him. Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by Morse code through the walls of their apartments.",

I get that the movie's themes and how it delivers them is quite...shocking, but it still felt quite accessible to me. The surrealism, the action, the cinematography was all top notch, and was visually compelling enough that I thought it would also attract more 'mainstream' audiences. I get that it's a movie that demands a fair amount of engagement to land its themes, but still, it was so engaging that that level of attention felt effortless to me.",

Even the movie itself goes through a sort of genre-bending transformation, with its head deep in psychological horror, and its second half deeper in contemplation and drama. Overall, this movie felt exceptionally unique, fresh, and special - both for its bold ambitions and its masterful execution.",

                "Plot": "Jen and Richard take a chartered helicopter to his secluded luxury vacation home in the desert. The pilot gives Richard a small bag of peyote. Jen is a young, beautiful American who wants to move to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams and believes Richard can help her. She seduces him, and afterwards, he calls his wife to check in. The next morning, Richard's friends Stan and Dimitri arrive early to take part in a hunting trip. Richard is forced to introduce Jen to them as he planned for her to leave before they arrived. That night, the four of them party. Jen asks to take the peyote but Richard declines, citing an anecdote he heard about a man who took peyote and sawed off his own leg without feeling it. Inebriated, Jen dances a sexy routine. When an exhausted Richard declines to join her, she dances seductively with Stan instead. Jen awakes to Richard being away for the morning. Stan becomes aggressive when she rebuffs his advances, and eventually rapes her. Dimitri sees the rape but ignores it. Richard returns and berates Stan, but when Jen asks to go home, he insists that she move to Canada on his dime. When Jen threatens to reveal their relationship to Richard's wife, Richard slaps her, and she runs off into the desert, pursued by the three men. Richard then shoves her off a cliff and she is impaled by a tree branch. Believing Jen to be dead, Richard assures his friends that they can finish their trip before anyone finds the body. Jen regains consciousness, and while bleeding, is able to painfully free herself, but with a piece of the tree branch still stuck through her torso. When the men return, she hides. With night approaching, they split up to cover more ground. Jen catches Dimitri alone, but he grabs her face and holds her underwater. She grabs his hunting knife and stabs him in the eye. With Dimitri dead, Jen takes his shotgun and hides in a cave. She remembers she has Richard's peyote and takes it, before entering a heightened state of mind when she removes the branch and heats a beer can in the fire to cauterize the wound. The artwork on the can leaves a perfect brand/scar of a phoenix on her belly. After a series of nightmares of the men hunting her, Jen leaves the cave to deal with them. Richard and Stan find Dimitri's body in the water. Stan takes the SUV to continue the hunt, but while filling the gas tank, Jen ambushes him. A bloody gunfight follows, and Stan is shot and killed by Jen while trying to run her over. After not being able to contact Stan on the radio, Richard speeds back home and calls a helicopter to pick him up. While showering, he hears a noise. Jen surprises him and manages to shoot him in the stomach. The two chase each other around the house with shotguns as Richard's blood covers every floor and wall. Despite his blood loss, Richard is able to catch Jen and begins strangling her, but Jen forces her hand into his exposed stomach, allowing her to retake the gun and ultimately shoot Richard dead. A bloodied but triumphant Jen walks out of the house as she hears the helicopter approach.",

I wanted her to go somewhere else and transform into a cool and badass character.'",

Principal photography on the film began on 6 February and wrapped on 21 March 2017."

Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 81 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating 'universal acclaim'."

                "Plot": "Ove Lindahl, a 59-year-old widower, lives in a townhouse neighborhood where he once chaired the association until his friend Rune replaced him. Rune, now paralyzed from a stroke, is cared for by his wife, Anita. Since his wife Sonja, a schoolteacher, died from cancer six months ago, Ove has been depressed. Forced into retirement from the railroad company where he worked for 43 years, Ove's routine involves enforcing neighborhood rules and visiting Sonja's grave to talk to her. After sorting out his affairs, Ove tries to hang himself, triggering a flashback to his childhood. His mother's death left him with his silent father, a mechanic at the train company. His father's excitement about Ove's academic success leads to a fatal accident when he's hit by a train while spreading the news. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Iranian immigrant Parvaneh, her Swedish husband Patrick, and their children moving in across the street. Her persistence breaks through Ove's tough exterior, causing him to abandon the noose for carbon monoxide poisoning. As Ove drifts into unconsciousness, memories flood back of 'the Whiteshirts' trying to demolish his childhood home, which he defiantly repairs. A fire started by a neighbor leads to Ove also losing his home, forcing him to sleep on a train where he meets Sonja. Smitten, he starts dating her, and she inspires him to pursue an engineering degree. In the present, Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted again by Parvaneh needing a ride to the hospital for her husband's accident. After reluctantly helping, Ove ends up supervising Parvaneh and Patrick's daughters in the lobby, causing a scene and being asked to leave. Later, at the train station, he plans to end his life but instead saves a man who faints onto the tracks. His heroic act catches the attention of Lena, a local reporter, whom he evades with Parvaneh's help. Parvaneh persuades Ove to teach her how to drive, leading to conversations about his past friendship with Rune and their falling out over car preferences. At Parvaneh's insistence, Ove reluctantly takes in a stray cat, and starts to bond with it. He also repairs a confiscated bike for a local teen named Adrian, who works at a kebab shop with Mirsad. Ove notices Mirsad's eye makeup but doesn't judge him. Despite improving relations with his neighbors, Ove clashes with two Whiteshirts. He then tries to end his life with a shotgun but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad seeking refuge after Mirsad's family disowns him for coming out as gay. Reluctantly, Ove offers him shelter. Ove learns that the Whiteshirts plan to move Rune to a nursing home, information Anita kept from him and Sonja. Ove realizes his grudge against Rune was foolish and declares war on the Whiteshirts. However, his confrontations yield little results. Frustrated, Ove shares with Parvaneh about a tragic vacation in Spain with a pregnant Sonja that ended in a bus crash. Despite Ove's efforts, Sonja lost the baby and was left paraplegic, leading Ove to build a wheelchair ramp at her school when authorities failed to do so. In the present day, journalist Lena confronts the Whiteshirts with evidence of their financial misconduct, leading to their retreat in the face of public scrutiny. Backed by supportive neighbors, Anita prevents Rune's forced relocation, allowing Ove to reconcile with him. Later, Ove collapses and is hospitalized with an enlarged heart. Parvaneh gives birth to a son while teasing Ove about his failed attempts at dying. Ove gifts his unborn child's crib to Parvaneh and forms a close bond with her daughters, who affectionately call him grandpa. Months pass, and during a winter storm, Ove is found peacefully dead in his bed, with his cat by his side. His modest funeral is attended by numerous neighbors, symbolizing the impact he had on their lives. Finally at peace, Ove awakens on a train to find Sonja sitting across from him once more.",

                "Plot": "Two girls, Agnes and Elin, attend school in the small town of Åmål, Sweden. Elin is outgoing and popular but finds her life unsatisfying and dull. Agnes, by contrast, has no real friends and is constantly depressed. Agnes is in love with Elin but cannot find any way to express it. Agnes's parents worry about their daughter's reclusive life and try to be reassuring. Her mother decides, against Agnes's will, to throw a 16th birthday party for her. Agnes is afraid no one will come. Viktoria, a girl in a wheelchair, shows up and Agnes shouts at her in front of her parents, telling her they are friends only because no one else will talk to them. Agnes, overcome with anger and depression, goes to her room and cries into her pillow shouting that she wishes she were dead, while her father tries to soothe her. Viktoria leaves and Agnes's family eats the food made for the party. Elin arrives at Agnes's house, mainly as an excuse to avoid going to another party, where there will be a boy (Johan, played by Mathias Rust) she wants to avoid. Elin's older sister, Jessica, who comes with her, dares her to kiss Agnes, who is rumoured to be a lesbian. Elin fulfills the dare and then runs out with Jessica, only to soon feel guilty for having humiliated Agnes. After becoming drunk at the other party, Elin gets sick and throws up. Johan tries to help her and ends up professing his love to her. Elin leaves Johan and the party, only to return to Agnes's house to apologize for how she acted earlier. In doing so, Elin stops Agnes from cutting herself. She even manages to persuade Agnes to return with her to the other party. On the way, Elin shares her real feelings about being trapped in Åmål. She asks Agnes about being a lesbian and believes that their problems could be solved by leaving Åmål and going to Stockholm. On impulse, Elin persuades Agnes to hitchhike to Stockholm, which is a five-hour journey by car. They find a driver who agrees to take them, believing them to be sisters who are visiting their grandmother. While sitting in the back seat, they have their first real kiss. The driver sees them and, shocked at the behaviour of the two 'sisters', orders them to leave the car. Elin discovers that she is attracted to Agnes but is afraid to admit it. She proceeds to ignore Agnes and refuses to talk to her. Elin's sister Jessica sees that she is in love and pushes her to figure out who it is. To cover the fact that she is in love with Agnes, Elin lies, pretending to be in love with Johan, and loses her virginity during a short-lived relationship with him. Elin eventually admits her feelings, when, after a climactic scene in a school bathroom, they are forced to 'out' their relationship to the school. The film ends with Elin and Agnes sitting in Elin's bedroom drinking chocolate milk. Elin explains that she often adds too much chocolate until her milk is nearly black. She must fill another glass with milk and mix it and that her sister Jessica often gets mad that she finishes the chocolate. Elin has the last word saying 'It makes a lot of chocolate milk. But that doesn't matter.'",

There are three things that impressed me the most about this movie: 1. The cute face and hairstyle of little girl Yingzi, and her eyes are full of innocence. 2. The theme music that always appears at the right time, revealing a touch of parting emotion. 3. The slow-paced way of life in old Beijing. For example, camels and donkeys are used as means of transportation, to dig well water, etc. Everything is the real memory of little girl Yingzi, through her innocent eyes observation, it is really full of emotion, as if it is an unreal past. But I know that those people and things did exist. The good thing is that the little girl doesn't distinguish between good and bad, so she can get close to many people. Now we are all good at value judgment and moral judgment, and it is difficult to be a quiet observer like her. 'Let the past thing pass'. This is one of lines. With the lyrics of the theme music, life seems to be constantly saying goodbye to people and things in the past. Both unpleasant and beautiful things will gradually leave us.
