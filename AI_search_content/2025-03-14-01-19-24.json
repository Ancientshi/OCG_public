                    "content": "- Home\n- Film Lists\n- People Lists\n- Other Lists\n- Reviews\n- About\n- Write For Us and Get Paid\n\n&gt;  &gt;  &gt;\n\n# The 10 Most Mind-Bending Psychological Thrillers Of The 21st Century\n\nby\n\nPsychological Thrillers are not a new genre of movies and have been around for decades, however, the 21st century has seen the refinement of this category with movies which are beyond praiseworthy. What sets this genre apart is its unique ability to engage the audience in such a way that they feel the emotional turmoil of the characters to an exceedingly empathetic level and see how they cope and navigate challenges they are faced with.\n\nNot only can movies of this genre be unsettling, but they also excel at leaving the audience full of questions, and second guessing themselves, and allow them to expand the parameters of what they think is going on with the plot. With adept use of misdirection, unreliable narrators, vivid, and often non-linear storylines, these movies challenge the audience’s scope for understanding the convoluted plots. The 20th century served as a catalyst for Psychological thrillers, with movies like, ‘Shadow of Doubt’, ‘Strangers on a Train’, ‘The Sixth Sense’ and ‘Fight Club’, showcasing the different ways the usually paranoid or frenzied characters psychologically battle their demons, be they real or imagined.\n\n1. Nocturnal Animals (2016)\n\nFrom what was only Tom Ford’s second movie, came one of the most disturbing features of the 2010s. With its immaculate attention to detail, heavy use of symbolism and glamorous costuming, it’s easy to see why Nocturnal Animals is such a cult classic. With compelling performances by the star studded cast including Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon (his role earning him an Academy award nomination), Isla Fisher and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the movie plays out all its tricks on the minds of the audience.\n\nThe movie follows a narrative within a narrative approach by playing out the events of Tony’s (Jake Gyllenhaal) book as his ex-wife Susan (Amy Adams) reads the bone chilling manuscript, and deals with fighting her guilt and resurfacing feelings for her ex-husband. The book details a family trip that the fictionalized versions of Tony, Susan and their daughter go on with the contents of the manuscript seemingly getting worse and gory, with themes of regret, betrayal, isolation and most prominently revenge showing up. Couple the distressing subject matter of the manuscript with Ford’s impressive attention to detail, breathtaking cinematography of the Mojave Desert and the use of vivid maroons peppered throughout the movie and you get a hauntingly beautiful tale of revenge and love lost.\n\nThe movie itself is chockful of symbolism, with even its name alluding to so much more than what the viewers initially assume. Susan’s career as an art curator further serves as the perfect backdrop for macabre art pieces and dark colors pallets making the scenes in the current time line seem just as ominous, tying in the book’s story to her actual life and implying at the similarity of them both.\n\nFord makes this movie, though hard to watch again, extremely unforgettable, and does a great job crafting a panic inducing, claustrophobic environment where the audience feels unsafe and caged in, just as the characters do, especially with its fast editing and unpredictable shifts from the manuscript to the real life timeline of the movie.\n\n2. The Machinist (2004)\n\nStarring Christian Bale as what is probably the most grueling character he has ever played and is directed by Brad Anderson, who you may know from movies like, ‘Fractured’ and ‘Session 9’, The Machinist remains his best work to date.\n\nChristian Bale lost 62 pounds and went on a strict diet of apples, water and coffee daily for the movie, playing the insomniac factory worker, Trevor Reznik. Given him being severely underweight and his unkempt appearance, Trevor is treated like an outcast, which only gets worse when he is distracted by Ivan (John Sharian), a coworker he doesn’t recognize, and accidently injures another coworker Miller (Michael Ironside), making him lose his arm. To Trevor’s confusion, no one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him working there at all.\n\nTrevor begins to see mysterious post-its appear on his refrigerator and becomes plagued by hallucinations and becomes obsessed with finding Ivan, leading him to become increasingly paranoid in a quest for answers. As the story progresses, the viewers uncover more about Trevor’s dark past and the guilt he carries. The film expertly displays the role guilt and punishment have on a person’s physical and mental health and shows how a declining psyche can lead to such a life-threatening level.\n\n3. Enemy (2013)\n\nThe second of Jake Gyllenhaal movies to make this list, Enemy, directed by Denis Villeneuve who you might know from Dune (2021), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Arrival (2016), is perhaps his most peculiar and hard to understand on a first watch.\n\nAdam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history professor who lives a quiet life with his partner Mary (Mélanie Laurent). While watching a movie, he discovers an actor, Anthony Claire, who looks strikingly like him, and tracks him down and begins to stalk him out of curiosity. This meeting of the look-alikes sends both their lives into a spiral, with Adam becoming obsessed with Anthony’s pregnant wife (Sarah Gadon) and Anthony wanting to impersonate Adam and sleep with his girlfriend.\n\nThe movie explores the subconscious and plays on the duality of man in terms of duty, fidelity, and most prominently, desire. With each of the look-alikes portraying different stages or versions of inherently the same person/entity. The movie does a great job at withholding information from the audience and dropping subtle clues on what exactly is happening and whose narrative to believe, leaving you with so many questions that you want to immediately re-watch and pick it apart to see what you might have overlooked your first time.\n\n4. Shutter Island (2010)\n\nAdapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane and directed by Martin Scorcese, Shutter Island is regarded as one of the most critically acclaimed acting projects of Leonardo DiCaprio’s career. Being an instant success and granting Scorcese his biggest box office opening at $41 million, Shutter Island is time and time again considered one of the movies most synonymous with the Psychological thriller genre. With a stellar cast besides DiCaprio including big names such as Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson, the performances delivered by the actors in this movie are engaging and explore each of their acting capabilities to the fullest.\n\nThe movie is set in the 1950s and begins with Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), a U.S Marshall and his partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) who are tasked with investigating the disappearance of a patient (Emily Mortimer) from an asylum for the criminally insane at the deserted Shutter Island. Teddy begins to suffer from migraines, hallucinations and flashbacks from his past about his time in service and of his wife’s death, and discloses to Aule that he took this case in an effort to find his wife’s killer whom he believes may be on the Island.\n\nOne unfortunate incidence begins to follow another with the escaped inmate claiming she is Teddy’s wife to alleged lobotomies, and an inmate telling him to not to trust Aule. With a series of perplexing events, Teddy’s paranoia gets considerably worse and after a particularly bad hurricane leaves the pair stranded at the Island and the inmates manage to escape, all of this adds to the already chaotic situation.\n\nAt the heart of it, Shutter Island delves into trauma and guilt and the lasting impact that can have on a person, with Teddy displaying various symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and an inability to accept his past.\n\n5. Black Swan (2010)\n\nWinning Natalie Portman her second Oscar nod and first win, Black Swan truly showcases Portman’s acting prowess and serves as a testament to an actor’s dedication to her character. With extensive ballet training daily for months and an adherence to a strict almond and carrot diet, she lost around 20 pounds for the movie.\n\nPortman plays the role of the determined ballerina Nina Sayers whom above all else wants to be cast as the lead role of White/Black swan in the upcoming performance of Swan Lake. Her devotion to get this role, along with her overbearing mother’s pressure, soon turns into a sick obsession, with her pushing her body and mind over the limit in an effort to be ‘perfect’. When a competitor arises in the form of Mila Kunis’ character, Lily, Nina’s jealously and need to prove and push herself escalate to a point that she starts to hallucinate and is no longer sure of what is really happening around her.\n\nThe movie does a great job at depicting Nina’s declining mental grasp on reality with surrealist shots mimicking her internal struggles of wanting to be perfect, more independent and desired. Not only is her mental health being affected, but the viewers get to see the strain on her body from her over extensive training sessions in an effort to be the best.\n\n0\n\n# Post navigation\n\n### Advertisement\n\n### Subscription Options:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Horror Movie Lists Roundup\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 30 Best Movies of 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Advertisement\n\n### The 30 Best Movies of 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 10 Most Surprisingly Good Movies of 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 10 Most Overrated Actors Working Today\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 20 Most Complex Movies of All Time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 18 Best Philosophical Movies of All Time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 20 Great Films About Loneliness That Are Worth Your Time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 25 Most Visually Stunning Films of The Past 5 Years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 20 Best Japanese Animated Movies of the 21st Century\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 25 Great Psychedelic Movies That Are Worth Your Time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 20 Great Dystopian Films That Are Worth Your Time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 25 Great Psychological Thrillers That Are Worth Your Time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 30 Greatest Westerns In Cinema History\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The 20 Worst Movies Ever Made\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 17 Disturbing Horror Movies You Will Never Watch Again\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Write For Us\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaste of Cinema 2019.

No? Just me? OK, WELL. Whether you want to or not, I figured it’s high-time to celebrate some of the books that left me the most mentally scarred. Because after surviving the pandemic, what ELSE would I want to dwell on, y’know?\n\nEver since the rampant success of novels like Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl, thrillers have been in a never-ending twist-off competition, constantly trying to out-do each other with jaw-dropping, out-of-nowhere plot explosions that don’t even necessarily make sense, most of the time. So this list is reserved solely for the novels that seamlessly slipped in twists that felt satisfying, earned, and of course, truly f*cking shocking. (And no, Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl are not included — they’re great and we all know it by now.)\n\n# Check out my latest thriller reviews!\n\n# 〰️\n\n# Check out my latest thriller reviews!\n〰️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check out my latest thriller reviews! 〰️\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Stay Awake' by Megan Goldin\n\nI've gotta be honest: at first I thought Stay Awake by Megan Goldin might be a watered-down rip-off of S. J. Watson's 2011 thriller Before I Go to Sleep. And, to be fair, there are some striking similarities: the heroine loses all memories of the previous day if she goes to sleep; she's surrounded by men who she can't fully trust; someone (who likely caused her memory loss in the first place) appears to want her dead. However, I have to give Goldin props — she takes a plot I could've sworn I'd seen before and creates a chilling, compulsively readable thriller with plenty of new things to fall in love with (and get freaked out by).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'My Murder' by Katie Williams\n\nIf you want to get technical, everything in My Murder by Katie Williams really boils down to one simple question: “What if you had to solve your own murder?” (Hah, just kidding — it’s anything but simple.) For me, the book more than lives up to its inventive premise — the victim of a local serial killer is brought back from the dead by a government project, and begins to suspect not all is at it seems — delivering a twist that’s as bittersweet as it is surprising.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Quiet Girl' by S.F. Kosa\n\nS.F. Kosa's The Quiet Girl follows a husband’s efforts to track down his missing wife, and is a bit of a psychological mind-f*ck, to say the least. It kept me guessing quite literally until the last chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Night Shift' by Alex Finlay\n\nThis fast-paced novel about a pair of Final Girls trying to figure out the person behind a new, vicious massacre is good as hellllll. It’s a thriller designed to shock and awe, so of course there are some occasionally eye-roll-worthy moments. But it’s excellently plotted with pulse-pounding twists that don’t feel forced or out of the left field’s left field (for the most part).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Hidden Pictures' by Jason Rekulak\n\nI truly think that the eerie Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulakis one of those twisty novels that is best read with as little beforehand knowledge about the ins and outs of the story as possible. It’s entertaining and engaging, with Rekulak deftly moving the story along at a fast clip, leading to a jaw-dropping, polarizing twist.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'When No One Is Watching' by Alyssa Cole\n\nWhen No One Is Watching gives Brooklyn’s growing gentrification problem an even more horrifying spin in this thriller, which has shades of Rear Window and Get Out. It’s not my favorite book in the world, but there’s no denying it packs a twisty punch.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Good Girl' by Mary Kubica\n\nMary Kubica's The Good Girl is a fast-paced, taut thriller revolving around a high-profile kidnapping case in Chicago: Mia Dennett, the 20-something daughter of a prominent judge, is abducted by a strange man and held for ransom. Rather than telling the story from Mia’s perspective in captivity, the novel sees things through the eyes of Mia's anxiety-ridden mom, the world-weary detective assigned to her case, and, most importantly, the desperate man holding her hostage. It moves at a breakneck pace, and the last, “oh DAMN” twist has always stayed with me.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Long Weekend' by Gilly MacMillan\n\nRegardless of my ultimate feelings about The Long Weekend, I have to hand it to author Gilly Macmillan: she clearly set out to do the absolute f*cking most when it came to this twisty, unpredictable thriller, and she succeeded. Really, really, really succeeded. Did she sit down before writing this story — about a girl’s trip gone awry when a mysterious note threatening the lives of their husbands is delivered to their isolated retreat — and say to herself, “how many truly unhinged characters I can conceivably squeeze into one novel?” It certainly seems so. (And I’m grateful for the choice, oop.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Child' by Fiona Barton\n\nSuper intense mystery alert! When the decades-old bones of an infant are discovered at a construction site in London in Fiona Barton’s The Child, journalist Kate Waters sets out to uncover the identity of the baby — could it be the same child who was stolen from a maternity ward in a local hospital decades earlier, but never found?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'In a Dark, Dark Wood' by Ruth Ware\n\nBad bachelorette parties usually involve Vegas, too much vodka, and a crying bride-to-be wearing a penis headband. Well, that’s not quite what the heroine of Ruth Ware's A Dark, Dark Wood experiences, but after reading it, I’d take a rough Vegas trip any day. In this twisty thriller, Leonora, a reclusive writer, agrees to attend the ‘hen do’ for a high school pal she hasn't spoken to in years, and soon finds old resentments and bitter feuds bubbling back up to the surface, ending in a shocking act of violence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Silent Patient' by Alex Michaelides\n\nI don’t even want to say too much about The Silent Patient, a truly shocking psychological thriller, for fear of spoiling even a teensy, tiny bit of it, but the gist is this: a woman's gruesome act of violence against her husband comes to the attention of a therapist, who falls deep into an obsession to uncover her motive. I know this book has been hyped to hell and back, at this point, but I really do think it lives up to its acclaim.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'His &amp; Hers' by Alice Feeney\n\nI wasn’t necessarily a huge fan of His &amp; Hers by Alice Feeny, but there’s no denying that this story is layered with twist after wild twist. It begins with a murder in a small, quintessentially British village, which leads a detective and a reporter assigned to cover the case down a dangerous path.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Wife Between Us' by Greer Hendricks &amp; Sarah Pekkanen\n\nThis book is jaw-dropping and disorienting in the best possible way — The Wife Between Us is a cat and mouse game, of sorts, between a jealous ex-wife and the pretty young woman who’s replaced her. But what if all is not as it seems? Dun, dun, DUNNNN.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'It's Always the Husband' by Michele Campbell\n\nI really wish I could erase this book from my mind completely just so I can have the pleasure of reading it with fresh, innocent eyes one more time. It’s Always the Husband is an ode to the kinds of friendships that burn bright and fast before flaming out in disastrous ways. Like, for example, ending with a murder on a bridge. Yikes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Seven Visitations of Sydney Burgess' by Andy Marino\n\nPrepare yourself, because reading The Seven Visitations of Sydney Burgess by Andy Marino feels like falling into a particularly grim fever dream. And I don’t necessarily mean that in a bad way! But this book is trippy, and leans harder and harder into stomach-turning body horror with each passing chapter as it sets up a twisty, devastating resolution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'We Were Liars' by E. Lockhart\n\nI brought this book on a vacation, and spent a few very intense hours ignoring my friends, the beach, the sun, and even the extremely loud people under the umbrella next to me as I ripped through this bleak, hypnotic, and incredibly suspenseful novel about a group of four young friends’ whose bond turns destructive. Go get We Were Liars and then settle in — you won’t be moving anytime soon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Last Word' by Taylor Adams\n\nThis eerie, claustrophobic thriller from the author of No Exit (another book with top-tier twists, btw) introduces us to a woman in a remote beach house who begins to wonder if an author is retaliating because of her one-star review of his book. It’s a fun read, and does a solid job of creating a tense atmosphere while ramping up the psychological suspense. To be fair, I did have some issues with it overall, but similar to No Exit, Adams’ method of blending gut-churning fear with jaw-dropping twists is undeniably effective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Darling Rose Gold' by Stephanie Wrobel\n\nFor a while there I was really burned out on the Munchausen syndrome by proxy obsession in pop culture (looking at you, Ryan Murphy), but then Darling Rose Gold came along and changed my mind. The story: After serving five years in prison, Patty Watts (who spent years convincing her daughter, Rose Gold, that she was ill even though she was perfectly healthy) gets out with nowhere to go and begs her daughter to take her in. The entire community is shocked when Rose Gold says yes, and then…..well, I’ll leave that for YOU to find out.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Shutter Island' by Dennis LeHane\n\nIf you haven’t already seen the movie adaption of Shutter Island, then go pick up this thrilling, atmospheric mystery about a US Marshal who’s sent to investigate the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in the 1950s. When the truth is finally revealed, you'll be rereading the final passages over and over again to make sure you aren't going crazy, too.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Hand That Feeds You' by A.J. Rich\n\nThis book is WILD, starting with a woman coming home to her apartment to find her fiancé mauled to death, and her normally docile dog covered in blood. But the real story in The Hand That Feeds You is, somehow, a whole lot deeper (and crazier) than that.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Sharp Objects' by Gillian Flynn\n\nAll hail Gillian Flynn, queen of batshit-crazy plot twists that somehow feel smart and well-earned, as well as jaw-dropping, all at once. You can’t really have a list of thrillers featuring shocking moments without her, you know? Sharp Objects is a personal fave (I really love Dark Places, too, fwiw) and packs one of the biggest literary gut-punches I’ve stumbled across in quite a while. Here’s the rundown, if you haven’t read it yet or seen the (equally excellent) TV adaptation: as journalist Camille Preaker reports on the unsolved murder of a preteen girl and the disappearance of another in her tiny hometown, she unearths disturbing memories as well as gruesome revelations regarding the killings.\n\n# The Most Disturbing Horror Novels I’ve Ever Read\n\n# 〰️\n\n# The Most Disturbing Horror Novels I’ve Ever Read\n〰️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Most Disturbing Horror Novels I’ve Ever Read 〰️\n\nNot done reading? You can shop my full list of thrillers with the best twists on Bookshop.org:\n\n© 2020 - 2025 What Is Quinn Reading? — Unauthorized use and/or duplication of this material without express and written permission from this site’s author and/or owner is strictly prohibited.

But what all thrillers have in common is their love for plot twists. To find a thriller without a twist is rare, but to find one with a truly shocking twist is even rarer. By definition, a plot twist is something truly unexpected, and unfortunately, more often than not, the audience can see it coming from a mile away.\n\nThrillers with a twist aren't going out of style, as proven by several recent flicks. Nothing beats the classics, though, which should be considered essential viewing for daring fans. A truly successful thriller movie has a plot twist that is so out-of-pocket that it has the audience's minds scrambled by the credits. From Memento to Flight Club, these best movies with a twist are a must-see.\n\n## 17 \n\n                            'Primal Fear' (1996)\n\n### Directed by Gregory Hoblit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHot-shot attorney Martin Vail (Richard Gere) takes up the defense of a young man named Aaron (Edward Norton), who is accused of the horrible murder of Archbishop Rushman. Before being taken in by the Archbishop, Aaron was a homeless child living on the streets with a stutter and shyness. Vail is certain that Aaron is innocent, but he starts to have second thoughts after watching a video that suggests Aaron might have had a legitimate reason for wanting the Archbishop killed.\n\nThroughout the film, Martin exposes more and more secrets that point to his client as the murderer, but with a determination to win does all that he can to prove his innocence. Primal Fear truly belongs to Norton, who is simultaneously innocent and disturbed. Edward Norton's incredible performance delivers twists like gut punches, and audiences are in for a treat.\n\n##### Primal Fear\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Laura Linney\n- Richard Gere\n- Edward Norton\n- John Mahoney\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 16 \n\n                            'Knives Out' (2019)\n\n### Directed by Rian Johnson\n\nImage via Lionsgate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen celebrated crime writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is discovered dead at his house just after turning 85, Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously hired to investigate. Blanc sorts through a labyrinth of red herrings and self-serving lies, from Harlan's dysfunctional and vulturous family to his devoted staff, to discover the truth about his sudden demise.\n\nDirector Rian Johnson sparked renewed interest in the whodunit genre with the award-winning 2019 film. This comedic thriller will have viewers suspecting every member of the family as they are all thoroughly unlikeable. But nothing is as it seems, which Blanc painfully realizes. When it comes to the moment of truth, Knives Out plays the scene out in one of the most satisfying reveals ever.\n\n##### Knives Out\n\nPG-13\n\n### Cast\n\n- Chris Evans\n- LaKeith Stanfield\n- Katherine Langford\n- Daniel Craig\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 15 \n\n                            'Arrival' (2016)\n\n### Directed by Denis Villenueve\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen enormous spacecraft touch down at 12 different locations worldwide, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is in charge of an elite team of investigators. Banks and her crew are racing against time to figure out how to communicate with the extraterrestrial visitors as the world teeters on the brink of war. She risks her life and maybe the survival of all humanity to solve the mystery.\n\nThis movie has no murder mystery, no revenge plot, and no punchy action scenes. Instead, Arrival is a beautifully nuanced story about the realities of what communicating with aliens looks like. The entire cerebral sci-fi thriller film has a tense and serious tone so that when the twist comes, it isn't something you see coming. And instead of being overly shocking, it mostly makes the audience think long and hard about what they just watched.\n\n##### Arrival\n\nPG-13\n\n### Cast\n\n- Michael Stuhlbarg\n- Forest Whitaker\n- Tzi Ma\n- Amy Adams\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 14 \n\n                            'Get Out' (2017)\n\n### Directed by Jordan Peele\n\nImage via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the most twisted thriller movies of the past few years, Get Out proved that Jordan Peele (formerly known for his comedic work) was a talent to look out for in the realm of modern horror filmmaking. It's by far one of the best directorial debuts of the 2010s, telling the tale of a young African American man named Chris, who's visiting his white girlfriend's parents for the weekend. There, his uneasiness about their reception of him reaches a terrifying boiling point.\n\nWith Get Out, Jordan Peele proved that psychological thriller movies with a twist are often the best kind. Get Out has plenty, none less shocking or mind-bending than the others. But it's the unexpected reveal of what the eerie family of Chris's girlfriend is really up to that recontextualizes the narrative and really ties the horror aspect of the movie together, proving that you don't need monsters to make a horror thriller terrifying. —Diego Pineda Pacheco\n\n##### Get Out\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Lyle Brocato\n- LaKeith Stanfield\n- Caleb Landry Jones\n- Betty Gabriel\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 13 \n\n                            'Mulholland Drive' (2001)\n\n### Directed by David Lynch\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA naive young actress (Noami Watts) moves to Hollywood only to become involved in a sinister plot involving a woman (Laura Harring) who was nearly murdered but now has amnesia due to a car accident. Eventually, both women are pulled into a nightmare involving a dangerous blue box, a director named Adam Kesher, and the mysterious nightclub Silencio.\n\nMany find Mulholland Drive a confusing and deeply psychological film that makes them question reality, and it is indeed one of director David Lynch's infamously perplexing works. While it is sometimes confusing, a patient mind will get the best from this film. With a beautiful love story and plenty of twists throughout, the ending is something no one can see coming.\n\n##### Mulholland Drive\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Laura Elena Harring\n- Mark Pellegrino\n- Justin Theroux\n- Naomi Watts\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 12 \n\n                            'The Departed' (2006)\n\n### Directed by Martin Scorsese\n\nImage via Warner Bros.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt's not like he ever needed to win any awards in order to go down in history as one of the best filmmakers of all time; nevertheless, it was The Departed that finally earned Martin Scorsese his Best Director Oscar (as well as winning Best Picture). This double-crossing police procedural is about an undercover cop in an Irish gang and a mole in the police, both of whom keep trying to identify each other.\n\nThe Departed is one of the best thrillers with a twist, and what a twist that is. Plenty of them, in fact. Like a good police procedural, The Departed is full of unexpected turns that keep the narrative engaging. But it's the twist in the third act of the movie, where Mark Wahlberg's Sean Dignam is left as one of only three main characters still alive, that really puts a golden seal on the whole narrative. — Diego Pineda Pacheco\n\n##### The Departed\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Martin Sheen\n- Matt Damon\n- Jack Nicholson\n- Mark Wahlberg\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 11 \n\n                            'Memento' (2000)\n\n### Directed by Christopher Nolan\n\nImage via Newmarket Films\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter a man breaks into his home and his wife is murdered, Leonard (Guy Pierce) is left with brain injuries. As he attempts to find the murderer of his wife, Leonard's head injury prevents him from remembering anything past several minutes. One storyline moves forward in time while the other tells the story backward, revealing more each time.\n\nMemento is told solely from the perspective of someone who can't remember anything. So how does the renowned Christopher Nolan film make sense? By being told backward, from the end to the beginning. Constantly full of surprises, Memento is one film that keeps audiences enthralled the whole time, especially as it leads to its iconic and terrifying twist that reveals the truth about the protagonist's wife.\n\n##### Memento\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Joe Pantoliano\n- Guy Pearce\n- Carrie-Anne Moss\n- Stephen Tobolowsky\n\n######\n\n## 10 \n\n                            'Gone Girl' (2014)\n\n### Directed by David Fincher\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) files a missing persons report on his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike). With the police and the media breathing down his neck, Nick's tale of a happy marriage begins to crumble. With his strange behavior and mountains of lies, people begin to wonder, did Nick Dunne kill his wife?\n\nA thriller about a broken marriage: one is missing, and the other is distraught. Or is he? With two main characters who live within lies and deceit, Gone Girl presents the audience with a cast of thoroughly unlikeable characters. Directed David Fincher's trademarks work wonderfully with the thriller, which takes audiences to some unexpected places. Though some may see the twist coming, Gone Girl has done wonders at convincing people to root for the evil within the movie.\n\n##### Gone Girl\n\n9.50\n\n### Cast\n\n- Ben Affleck\n- Rosamund Pike\n- Neil Patrick Harris\n- Tyler Perry\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 9 \n\n                            'The Sixth Sense' (1999)\n\n### Directed by M. Night Shyamalan\n\nImage via Buena Vista Pictures Distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChild psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is confronted one night by his former patient, who he failed to help. After his ex-patient shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it. A few months later, he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who has many of the same problems Vincent had including seeing ghosts who don't know they're dead.\n\nThis thriller is as heartbreaking as it is shocking, although most audiences today are likely already familiar with the film's infamous plot twist, which has been referenced and parodied countless times in pop culture. Viewed as M. Night Shyamalan's crowning achievement, The Sixth Sense has retained its notoriety as one of the best plot twist movie reveals in thriller history.\n\n##### The Sixth Sense\n\nPG-13\n\n### Cast\n\n- Bruce Willis\n- Toni Collette\n- Haley Joel Osment\n- Olivia Williams\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 8 \n\n                            'The Prestige' (2006)\n\n### Directed by Christopher Nolan\n\nImage via Buena Vista Pictures Distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn London at the end of the nineteenth century, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his loving wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and the magician's assistants. The two men become envious of one another after Robert accuses Alfred of triggering Julia's unexpected death during a performance. Both develop into highly popular, aggressive magicians who try to outperform one another on stage.\n\nWith two strong men at the forefront of the film, the male bravado is strong in The Prestige. Constantly butting heads, the two magicians go to enormous lengths to be on top. The film escalates to absurd levels, with The Prestige featuring numerous surprises leading up to its jaw-dropping twist ending. And when the twist is revealed, it begs the question; Was it worth it?\n\n##### The Prestige\n\nPG-13\n\n### Cast\n\n- Michael Caine\n- Christian Bale\n- Hugh Jackman\n- Scarlett Johansson\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 7 \n\n                            'Chinatown' (1974)\n\n### Directed by Roman Polanski\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChinatown, one of the best movies that turned 50 in 2024, is a storytelling masterclass and an icon among twist-filled thrillers. Praised as one of the best and darkest neo-noir films ever made, it stars Jack Nicholson as J.J. Gittes, a private detective hired to expose an adulterer in 1930s Los Angeles. Before he realizes it, he finds himself caught up in a web of deceit, corruption, and murder.\n\nWritten by the late Robert Towne, the screenplay of Chinatown is easily one of the most masterful ever written. Every character is rich and nuanced, every small detail adds something crucial to the airtight narrative — and, of course, every jaw-dropping twist changes up the whole game. It's the deadly twist at the end of the movie, though, that's remembered as one of the most shocking and devastating in the history of cinema. It's Chinatown, after all. — Diego Pineda Pacheco\n\n##### Chinatown\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Jack Nicholson\n- Faye Dunaway\n- John Huston\n- Perry Lopez\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 6 \n\n                            'Oldboy' (2003)\n\n### Directed by Park Chan-wook\n\nImage via Show East\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Oldboy, Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik), a man with alcoholism kidnapped on a rainy night in 1988, awakens in an odd hotel room with no windows. Oh Dae-Su is then freed after spending a torturous fifteen years in captivity. Oh Dae-Su is now encouraged by his merciless kidnapper to find the one responsible for his bizarre abduction and imprisonment and exact his savage, long-awaited retribution on the tormentor.\n\nWith one of the most heart-wrenching and inherently gross twists in thriller history, Oldboy has anyone who watches it clutching their pearls and shielding their eyes towards the end. The less said about this film the better, as its twist really does change the meaning and purpose of the protagonist's grueling journey.\n\n##### Oldboy\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Choi Min-sik\n- Yoo Ji-tae\n- Kang Hye-jeong\n- Kim Byeong-Ok\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 5 \n\n                            'Parasite' (2019)\n\n### Directed by Bong Joon-ho\n\nImage via NEON\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nParasite rightly took the world by storm when it first premiered in 2019, and it would later go on to make history at the 92nd Academy Awards. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, the black comedy thriller has a deceptively simple premise – it follows a poor family's maneuvers as they infiltrate a wealthy family's home by posing as skilled workers.\n\nSomething wild happens midway through the film that essentially changes its flow, narrative, and even genre. The powerful shift cements Parasite as one of the best thriller movies with a twist, and overall an unforgettably brilliant commentary on class structure and inequality. For anyone who hasn't seen the film yet and has been lucky enough to avoid spoilers, it's one that should be experienced as soon as possible.\n\n##### Parasite\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Yeo-Jeong Jo\n- Myeong-hoon Park\n- Jeong-eun Lee\n- Sun-kyun Lee\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 4 \n\n                            'The Usual Suspects' (1995)\n\n### Directed by Bryan Singer\n\nImage via Gramercy Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPraised as one of the '90s' best thrillers, The Usual Suspects is one of the most shocking mystery movies of a decade full of them. It's a whodunnit thriller where the sole survivor of a shoot-out tells the story of how a notorious criminal influenced the events that began with five criminals meeting in a police lineup. It's a movie that has no shortage of surprises up its sleeve, and none of them are less fun than the last.\n\nThe movie's final twist is brilliantly executed, recontextualizing the entire story and making it impossible to not want to watch the whole thing again. This is probably why it's remembered as one of the best plot twist movies ever devised, proving that a story can build its foundations on a twist as long as it's good and smartly constructed. — Diego Pineda Pacheco\n\n##### The Usual Suspects\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Kevin Spacey\n- Kevin Pollak\n- Benicio Del Toro\n- Gabriel Byrne\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 3 \n\n                            'Se7en' (1995)\n\n### Directed by David Fincher\n\nImage via New Line Cinema\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector David Fincher's Se7en is a classic crime thriller that needs no introduction. The acclaimed film follows disillusioned and experienced Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and his new partner, the much younger David Mills (Brad Pitt), as they pursue a serial killer whose elaborate crime scenes draw inspiration from the seven deadly sins.\n\nMost people already know the infamous twist in the 1995 movie, which has become ingrained in pop culture. The familiar \"what's in the box\" meme represents a chilling turning point toward the end of the film, which was an incredible gut-punch of an ending that ensured its place in the annals of cinematic history. Fans will be glad to know they can relive some of that excitement in the highly anticipated 4k remaster of Fincher's Se7en.\n\n##### Se7en\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Brad Pitt\n- Gwyneth Paltrow\n- John C.

His life seems to get a bit easier when he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another participant in support groups. However, he becomes involved in an illegal fight club and a soap-making plan when he befriends Tyler (Brad Pitt). Together, the two men go off the rails and enter into a power struggle for love.\n\nAmong the most iconic movies with plot twists, Fight Club has been celebrated since its release as one of the best thrillers ever made, with audiences still debating over the film's overall message. With fans often missing the point of the film, it is a necessary two-time watch. With plenty of Easter eggs and clues to the big twist, Fight Club holds its own.\n\n##### Fight Club\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Brad Pitt\n- Meat Loaf\n- Edward Norton\n- Jared Leto\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\n## 1 \n\n                            'Psycho' (1960)\n\n### Directed by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlfred Hitchcock is known as the master of suspense for a reason. The English filmmaker revolutionized the genre with his unique style, subversive narrative voice, and willingness to show stories, themes, and characters that were considered taboo at the time. The epitome of his career was arguably Psycho, his take on the horror-thriller genre, where a secretary on the run for embezzlement takes refuge in an eerie California motel owned by a mysterious man.\n\nPsycho has the thriller plot twist, the granddaddy of all thriller plot twists, the plot twist that forever changed the genre and the way directors approached it. The fact that such a groundbreaking twist was placed right in the middle of the film, entirely changing the way the second half plays out, was something completely unprecedented in 1960. To this day, it still works just as effectively. — Diego Pineda Pacheco\n\n##### Psycho\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Janet Leigh\n- Martin Balsam\n- Anthony Perkins\n- John Gavin\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\nNEXT: The Best Thrillers of All Time, Ranked\n\n- Movie\n- Thriller\n- Fight Club\n\nThread\n\nSign in to your  account\n\nWe want to hear from you!

But what all thrillers have in common is their love for plot twists. To find a thriller without a twist is rare, but to find one with a truly shocking twist is even rarer.

Detour19451h 6mApproved7.3 (21K)RateThe life of Al Roberts, a pianist in a New York nightclub, turns into a nightmare when he decides to hitchhike to Los Angeles to visit his girlfriend.DirectorEdgar G. UlmerStarsTom NealAnn SavageClaudia DrakeThe 1945 film noir Detour is told from the perspective of an unreliable protagonist who may be trying to justify his actions.\n\nThis movie is the best case of use of an Unreliable Narrator, which upon repeated viewings increases the charm of the movie.\n- 2. The Usual Suspects19951h 46mMA8.5 (1.2M)Rate76MetascoreThe sole survivor of a pier shoot-out tells the story of how a notorious criminal influenced the events that began with five criminals meeting in a seemingly random police lineup.DirectorBryan SingerStarsKevin SpaceyGabriel ByrneChazz PalminteriThe 1995 film The Usual Suspects reveals that the narrator had been deceiving the characters in the movie, and hence the audience, by the story he is telling. The character Keyser Soze has something to do with the unreliable narrative.\n- 3. Memento20001h 53mMA8.4 (1.4M)Rate83MetascoreLeonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, suffers from anterograde amnesia and uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife, which is the last thing he remembers.DirectorChristopher NolanStarsGuy PearceCarrie-Anne MossJoe PantolianoThe Narrator himself is not in the know of things happening around him. A Great example of unreliable narrator.\n- 4. Fight Club19992h 19mR18+8.8 (2.4M)Rate67MetascoreAn insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into much more.DirectorDavid FincherStarsBrad PittEdward NortonMeat LoafIn the 1999 film Fight Club, it is revealed that the narrator suffers from dissociative identity disorder and that some events were fabricated. The Character Tyler Durden has something to do with the unreliable narrative.\n- 5. Rashomon19501h 28mM8.2 (188K)Rate98MetascoreThe rape of a bride and the murder of her samurai husband are recalled from the perspectives of a bandit, the bride, the samurai's ghost and a woodcutter.DirectorAkira KurosawaStarsToshirô MifuneMachiko KyôMasayuki MoriIn Rashômon (1950), a Japanese crime drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, adapted from \"In a Grove\" (1921), uses multiple narrators to tell the story of the death of a samurai. Each of the witnesses describe the same basic events but differ wildly in the details, alternately claiming that the samurai died by accident, suicide, or murder. The term \"Rashômon effect\" is used to describe how different witnesses are able to produce contradictory accounts of the same event, though each version is presented with equal sincerity and each is plausible when considered independently of the others. The film does not select the \"authentic\" narrator from the differing accounts: at its conclusion, all versions remain equally plausible and equally suspect.\n- 6. Shutter Island20102h 18mMA15+8.2 (1.5M)Rate63MetascoreTwo US marshals are sent to a mental institution on an inhospitable island in order to investigate the disappearance of a patient.DirectorMartin ScorseseStarsLeonardo DiCaprioEmily MortimerMark RuffaloThe Narrator is lying to himself and to the audience. Great Ending btw.\n- 7. The Sixth Sense19991h 47mM8.2 (1.1M)Rate64MetascoreAfter being shot by a resentful former patient whom he failed to help, a Philadelphia child psychologist seeks redemption by treating a young boy with a disturbing secret.DirectorM. Night ShyamalanStarsBruce WillisHaley Joel OsmentToni ColletteThe Narrator himself doesn't know what is happening around him or even to him!!! Classic Unreliable Narrator.\n- 8. Stage Fright19501h 51mG7.0 (17K)Rate62MetascoreA struggling actress tries to help a friend prove his innocence after he's accused of murdering the husband of a high-society entertainer.DirectorAlfred HitchcockStarsMarlene DietrichJane WymanRichard ToddThe 1950 Alfred Hitchcock film Stage Fright (1950) uses the device of unreliable narration by presenting the aftermath of a murder in a flashback, as told by the murderer. The details of the flashback provide an explanation which helps convince the innocent main protagonist of the film to help the murderer, believing him innocent.\n- 9. Gone Girl20142h 29mMA15+8.1 (1.1M)Rate79MetascoreThe husband of a missing woman becomes the chief suspect in her disappearance.DirectorDavid FincherStarsBen AffleckRosamund PikeNeil Patrick HarrisAmy and Nick both are unreliable narrators, they are lying to the audience in the full first half of the movie.\n- 10. Possessed19471h 48mPG7.1 (6.1K)RateAfter being found wandering the streets of Los Angeles, a severely catatonic woman tells a doctor the complex story of how she wound up there.DirectorCurtis BernhardtStarsJoan CrawfordVan HeflinRaymond MasseyIn Possessed (1947), Joan Crawford plays a woman who is taken to a psychiatric hospital in a state of shock. She gradually tells the story of how she came to be there to her doctors, which is related to the audience in flashbacks, some of which are later revealed to be hallucinations or distorted by paranoia\n- 11. Forrest Gump19942h 22mM8.8 (2.4M)Rate82MetascoreThe history of the United States from the 1950s to the '70s unfolds from the perspective of an Alabama man with an IQ of 75, who yearns to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart.DirectorRobert ZemeckisStarsTom HanksRobin WrightGary SiniseIn the movie version of Forrest Gump (1994), the title character narrates his life story, and in the process naïvely refers to Apple Computer as a \"fruit company\" while also assuming that sustaining a \"million dollar wound\" meant that one would get paid for it. He also states that Jenny's dad treated her well because \"he was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.\"\n- 12. A Beautiful Mind20012h 15mM8.2 (1M)Rate72MetascoreA mathematical genius, John Nash made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a harrowing journey of self-discovery.DirectorRon HowardStarsRussell CroweEd HarrisJennifer ConnellyIn the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, it is eventually revealed that the narrator is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and many of the events he witnessed occurred only in his own mind.\n- 13. Hero20021h 47mM7.9 (190K)Rate85MetascoreA defense officer, Nameless, was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.DirectorYimou ZhangStarsJet LiTony Leung Chiu-waiMaggie CheungIn the 2002 film Hero, the protagonist is identified as an unreliable narrator by the antagonist, who responds by constructing his own alternate version of the false story. In the last part of the film, the protagonist tells the real story, which explains his presence in the current situation.\n- 14. American Psycho20001h 42mR7.6 (770K)Rate64MetascoreA wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.DirectorMary HarronStarsChristian BaleJustin TherouxJosh LucasPatrick Bateman makes \"Money's\" John Self look even more out of shape, when it comes to commenting on the big brands and applying his murderous hands to the unsuspecting and the vulnerable. Yet Ellis's great comment on consumerism and the death of high culture could just be a mirror to our own deluded thoughts, and Bateman nothing more than a sickly funny fantasist.\n- 15. Primal Fear19962h 9mMA7.7 (257K)Rate47MetascoreA high-profile murder intrigues a publicity hungry lawyer.DirectorGregory HoblitStarsRichard GereLaura LinneyEdward NortonOne Character is lying to other characters and to the audience too, and everyone fell for his con.\n- 16. The Lone Ranger20132h 30mM6.4 (248K)Rate37MetascoreNative American warrior Tonto recounts the untold tales that transformed John Reid, a man of the law, into a legend of justice.DirectorGore VerbinskiStarsJohnny DeppArmie HammerWilliam FichtnerIn the 2013 film The Lone Ranger the narrator, Tonto (Johnny Depp), is identified quickly as potentially unreliable by a child attending a 1930s carnival sideshow during extensive questioning about the events leading to the origin of the Wild West character the child emulates. The child is wearing the costume identified with the fictional Western hero of radio, comics, films, and television. The events related by the narrator vaguely follow an alternative version of character development that occurred during its radio dramas and the beginning of its television series, but with novel disclosures of graphic details that occur as a series of flashbacks portraying the elderly Tonto's memories of the events. Along with the child, the audience is left to make their own judgments about the memories of Tonto.\n- 17. Amarcord19732h 3mM7.8 (49K)RateA series of comedic and nostalgic vignettes set in a 1930s Italian coastal town.DirectorFederico FelliniStarsMagali NoëlBruno ZaninPupella MaggioThe title Amarcord apparently translates in Roman dialect as \"I Remember\", yet this chaotic film is in no way a straightforward recollection of childhood experiences. As Fellini himself once commented: \"My films from my past, recount memories that are completely invented.\" The scatological jokes about belching, and farting coexist with an air of melancholy that's maintained by Nino Rota's evocative music. Fellini constantly draws our attention to the fact that we're watching a piece of fiction: the residents' stories are far from reliable, actors deliver their lines to camera, and the elderly narrator (Luigi Rossi) is interrupted by off-screen disruptions.\n- 18. Big Fish20032h 5mPG8.0 (468K)Rate58MetascoreA frustrated son tries to determine the fact from fiction in his dying father's life.DirectorTim BurtonStarsEwan McGregorAlbert FinneyBilly CrudupAs William retraces his father's steps, revisiting his old stomping grounds and seeking out witnesses to what may or may not have happened, the truth is revealed to be anything but the simple black-and-white affair that any of us expected. What William discovers is that even his father's most over-arching conceits and purely fantastic fictions contain an essence of truth, an essence more valuable than what might be gleaned from a more literal version. Dad, of course, was right: reality is overrated. And all of those impossibly tall tales told over the course of the movie eventually come to resemble some enormous, sweet onion, with endless layers of story to be peeled away before getting to a core of meaning.\n- 19. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari19201h 16mPG8.0 (73K)RateHypnotist Dr. Caligari uses a somnambulist, Cesare, to commit murders.DirectorRobert WieneStarsWerner KraussConrad VeidtFriedrich FeherThe deranged mind in Caligari was revealed through flashback.  Cinema moving backwards and forward in time, a quantum leap that thrust the oneiric engagement of the viewer within the frame of flickering images from passive observer to a participant who must engage actively in constructing a narrative.  The revealed unreliability of the narrative throwing the viewer into an abyss of incomprehension and confusion in movies like Un Chien Andolou.  A fractured kaleidoscope where meaning is continually undone and rewoven before the audience’s eyes.\n- 20. High Tension20031h 31mR18+6.7 (80K)Rate42MetascoreBest friends Marie and Alexia decide to spend a quiet weekend at Alexia's parents' secluded farmhouse. But on the night of their arrival, the girls' idyllic getaway turns into an endless night of horror.DirectorAlexandre AjaStarsCécile de FranceMaïwennPhilippe NahonWe watch this story through the eyes of Marie (Cécile de France), who goes to stay with Alex (Maïwenn) and her family in a remote French house. \n\nWhich is when a serial killer turns up. \n\nSpoiler :- In the film's shocking final twist, Marie is revealed as the serial killer – she merely created a separate persona in her mind to carry out her killings.\n- 21. PoirotEpisode: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd(2000)1989–20131h 39mM7.3 (2.6K)RateTV EpisodePoirot comes out of retirement when his industrialist friend is brutally murdered a short while after a local widow who was suspected of killing her husband commits suicide.DirectorAndrew GrieveStarsDavid SuchetPhilip JacksonOliver Ford DaviesIn this classic Agatha Christi story there are multiple unreliable narratives. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was hailed as a cornerstone in the genre and is still known as “one of the most influential crime novels ever written,” as said by Howard Haycraft in 1941.\n- 22. Lolita19622h 33mA7.5 (112K)Rate79MetascoreA middle-aged college professor becomes infatuated with a 14-year-old girl.DirectorStanley KubrickStarsJames MasonShelley WintersSue LyonNever straight with himself, let alone the ladies and gentlemen of the jury to whom he is ultimately addressing his words, Humbert Humbert arrived halfway through the 20th century, intent on justifying his appalling crime. Nabokov's syntactical genius is the one true triumph.\n- 23. The Innocents19611h 40mPG7.7 (34K)Rate88MetascoreA young governess for two children becomes convinced that the house and grounds are haunted.DirectorJack ClaytonStarsDeborah KerrPeter WyngardeMegs JenkinsIs it a ghost story, or the tragic tale of a young woman undergoing a breakdown? Believing her two young charges are communing with the spirits of her two dead predecessors, the prim governess of Bly House becomes increasingly panic-stricken and erratic, until she's left with a dead boy in her arms.\n- 24. Heart of Darkness19931h 40mPG5.7 (2.2K)RateTV MovieA trading company manager travels up an African river to find a missing outpost head and discovers the depth of evil in humanity's soul.DirectorNicolas RoegStarsTim RothJohn MalkovichIsaach De BankoléRight at the start we're told that Marlow likes to spin yarns. However, his tale of journeying up the Congo, in search first of ivory, and then the infamous Kurtz, is one of the most powerful stories in literature. Whether his story is strictly faithful becomes irrelevant, as Marlow ends up highlighting the moral corruption at the heart of all humans.\n- 25. Money20102 epsMA15+5.4 (130)RateTV Mini SeriesJohn Self is good at making money, he's due to make a hell of a lot more. The only trouble is... he's better at spending it.StarsNick FrostVincent KartheiserEmma PiersonJohn Self is one of literature's most repulsively addictive narrators. The book might be subtitled \"A Suicide Note\", but it is in fact a love story, with Self dreaming up ever more extravagant ways to shed his wedge while pursuing entirely corruptible Selina Street, among others. The fact that Self might never have actually existed, revealed towards the end, is Amis's sly take on the death of the self.\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Every \"Once upon a time...\" and \"A long, long time ago...\" is meant to be followed by an accurate account of events...or so we're told. Some tales, in fact, unfold from the perspective of personas who take liberties with the truth. This classic storytelling device is called the unreliable narrator.\n\nRELATED: Movies Based On \"True Stories\" That Are Completely Inaccurate\n\nUnreliable narrators have permeated the realm of cinema, and the results have been mind-boggling. Thanks to these tricky story-tellers, moviegoers have been left to wonder if the objective truth of certain films has been compromised. This is no novelty act, either: many outstanding films thrived from an extra layer of intrigue created by questionable narration.\n\n## Rashomon: What Is Truth, Again?\n\nImage via Daiei Film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmong all the films that feature unreliable narration, perhaps the most prominent is Rashomon, an Akira Kurosawa work that came out in 1950. Based on short fiction by author Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Rashomon is centered on the mystery surrounding the murder of a samurai. Here's why it's a mystery: the three people involved in the murder—including the victim, speaking through a medium—all tell different, even contradictory accounts!\n\nOn a philosophical level, Rashomon challenges the very nature of truth. To this day, the term \"Rashomon Effect\" is used to describe how a solitary event can be described or interpreted by different people in such contrasting ways.\n\n## Amadeus: An Embellished Composition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIs there such a thing as an Academy Award-winning unreliable narrator? This unique distinction belongs to F. Murray Abraham's Antonio Salieri, whose perspective frames the story of the 1984 film Amadeus. In this Miloš Forman masterpiece, Salieri is on a mission to take down renowned composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), who happens to be a foul-mouthed alcoholic.\n\nBut was he, really? The quality of Salieri's memory can certainly be called to question due to his advanced age and problematic mental condition. As such, his recollections throughout the entire film (including his audacious claim that he murdered Mozart) are shady at best and contradictory at worst.\n\n## Forrest Gump: An Adorable Type Of Unreliable\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile 1994’s Forrest Gump is widely known for its “box of chocolates” quote, what is less frequently mentioned is the titular character’s questionable story-telling. As the account of Forrest (Tom Hanks) becomes more and more extravagant—with mentions of Elvis Presley, Bear Bryant, and two US presidents—the audience can’t help but wonder if it’s all a tall tale.\n\nRELATED: Tom Hanks' Best Comedic Roles From Before He Became A Dramatic Actor\n\nForrest’s credibility as a narrator takes a major hit when a childhood flashback reveals his IQ level to be at 75. Despite this, his heart appears to be in the right place. By all indications, Forrest loved his son dearly; as such, he might have even told the boy some accurate bedtime stories.\n\n## The Usual Suspects: That Sly Devil\n\nImage via Gramercy Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow creative can an unreliable narrator be? Roger “Verbal” Kint (Kevin Spacey) put on a con artist masterclass in 1995’s The Usual Suspects. This certified classic puts the storyteller on the hot seat of interrogation, but it may as well have been a driver’s seat, as the manipulative Verbal was in control the entire time.\n\nVerbal’s narrative had it all: crime networks, urban legends, and survivor accounts. The con artist is eventually released by his interrogator Agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), who realizes the truth a few minutes too late. It turns out that the crime lord Keyser Söze, who figures heavily in Verbal’s story, was not some boogeyman whose face had never been seen. Verbal was Söze, and he concocted many of the intricate details in his narration by looking at random items and names in the interrogation room.\n\n## The Sixth Sense: A Deadly Twist\n\nImage via Buena Vista Pictures Distribution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile some narrators deliberately lie because of certain motives, other narrators are not even aware that their perspective has been wildly derailed. Take, for instance, the psychologist Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) in 1999’s The Sixth Sense. For much of the film, his focus was on the mysterious ability of 9-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) to allegedly “see dead people.” While this was certainly an enigma, Crowe was not prepared for what he was about to uncover.\n\nHeeding Cole’s advice, Crowe spoke with his estranged wife Anna (Olivia Williams) while she slept. It was then that reality struck him: like the other entities that Cole could speak with, Crowe was—wait for it—dead. He had not, in fact, survived the gunshot inflicted by a former patient at the start of the film. Creepy.\n\n## Fight Club: A Free-For-All, Struggle For All\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWho among us hasn’t harbored strong fantasies about what life could actually be? 1999’s Fight Club highlights the human tendency to project unfulfilled ideals by using (what else?) an unreliable narrator. Funnily enough, the film’s main character (played by Edward Norton) is simply named The Narrator. Unsatisfied by his career and material possessions, he decides to start a Fight Club with the impulsive, free-spirited Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).\n\nRELATED: Movies That Are Totally Different The Second Time Around\n\nHowever, The Narrator’s wild adventures with Tyler weren’t exactly as they seemed. In actuality, Tyler was a dissociated personality who represented the qualities that The Narrator aspired for. In the end, The Narrator puts Tyler away, thus surviving a fight that had been raging within him from the very start.\n\n## Black Swan: A Disturbed Dancer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDarren Aronofsky's Black Swan is a quintessential psycho-thriller. At multiple points in the film, the audience is just as confused about the nature of reality as the main character Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). A ballerina for a New York dance company, Nina has to navigate both the unrelenting pressures of the ballet industry and the instability of her paranoid mind.\n\nThanks to the film's beautiful yet haunting cinematography, the objective truth of the narrative gets lost in a maze of mirrors. Unfortunately for Nina, there seems to be no denying her final fate. At the conclusion of the film, she perishes from a self-inflicted fatal blow—a staggering revelation, considering that she thought she'd stabbed her rival Lily (Mila Kunis) just a few scenes earlier.\n\n## Life of Pi: Who Was On The Lifeboat?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTowards the end of 2012's Life of Pi, the writer played by Rafe Spall has to make a decision along with the viewing audience: which version of the protagonist's story is correct? Though both versions would have made a great memoir, the instinctive urge to discover the truth remained strong. In one version, sixteen-year-old Pi (Suraj Sharma) survives a shipwreck with some exotic animals, including an orangutan and a tiger named Richard Parker.\n\nIn the other version, the human companions of Pi take the place of the animals, leading to some horrifying implications of murder and cannibalism. Though the writer eventually indicated which version he preferred, the audience is left to wonder what really happened when the unreliable narrator was adrift at sea.\n\n## Gone Girl: Double The Trouble\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2014's Gone Girl, writing teacher Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is in a bind when he discovers that his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) is missing. A detective (Kim Dickens) conducts an investigation in their house, where she finds curious details like bloodstains and positive pregnancy results that Nick is unaware of. What could have happened in this fine suburban home?\n\nRELATED: Movies About Doomed Relationships\n\nWhy, it must have been inhabited by not one, but two unreliable narrators. On one hand, entries in Amy's diary suggest that her marriage to Nick wasn't as delightful as he claimed. On the other hand, Amy is further revealed to have pulled off an intricate scheme to try to frame her cheating husband for murder.\n\n## Joker: Makes More Cents Than Sense\n\nImage via Warner Bros. Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA film about the Clown Prince of Crime could not possibly have been told in a traditional, linear format. Just as his origins in the comics are ambiguous at best, 2019's Joker blurs its own narrative with delusions, bizarre transitions, and questionable family origins.\n\nWas Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) an illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen)—and, by extension, the half-brother of Gotham's future caped crusader? If Arthur totally made up his romantic interaction with his neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz), could he have fabricated any of the other exchanges seen in the film? The answers will never be clear as day, and moviegoers can do nothing but watch as Arthur mirthfully laughs.\n\nNEXT: 'Joker' And Other Non-Comedy Films From Comedy Directors\n\n- Movie\n\nRecommended\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### 10 Worst MCU Villains Made by the Heroes Themselves\n\n\"We create our own demons.\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### 10 Movies That Are Awful From Start to Finish\n\n\"There are some stains you can never wash out.\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Every Paul Verhoeven Sci-Fi Movie, Ranked\n\nIf you like sci-fi, you probably like Paul Verhoeven.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### 10 Box Office Bombs of the '90s That Became Cult Classics\n\nFirst rule of '90s cult classics: bomb at the box office.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The 10 Most Thrilling Spider-Man Scenes in Movies, Ranked\n\nScenes that will get your spider sense tingling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The 10 Best Ethan Hawke Movies, Ranked\n\n\"This is all we need.

Those are famous instances of filmmakers honing in on a specific category of film, with just as many popular names consistently directing thrillers. Certain incredible directors have become fittingly associated with the thriller genre, and this list compiles the greatest of the bunch.\n\nYou should without a doubt recognize most of the names on this list, while others will appear more unfamiliar. But their respective movies will without a doubt ring some bells, along with the members of their star-studded stables of actors. Either way, these are among cinema's all-time best legends, with fan-favorite filmographies to boot.\n\nThese are the 20 greatest thriller directors of all time, ranked.\n\n## 20 \n\n                            Antoine Fuqua\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKicking things off with a more modern director, it's worth noting off the bat that Antoine Fuqua is one of a few famous directors who frequently cast Denzel Washington in their projects. Of course, the most acclaimed of their collaborations was their very first: Training Day (2001). A crime-thriller, Washington co-starred with Ethan Hawke as narcotics officers, of course with a twist. Both performers were nominated at the Academy Awards, with Denzel even walking away with a golden statuette for Best Actor.\n\nFuqua and Washington continued their rip-roaring partnership a decade later with The Equalizer (2014), with The Equalizer 2 (2018) and The Equalizer 3 (2023) serving as the sequels. They're all entertaining, and they solidify Fuqua as a master of thrillers. What helps his case is that The Guilty (2021), with Jake Gyllenhaal, proved that he's capable of making a high-octane thriller even without the help of Denzel.\n\n## 19 \n\n                            Christopher Nolan\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA famous filmmaker, Christoper Nolan began his career deeply invested in thrillers before moving to sci-fi and historical films. Nolan's first three films create a kind of trilogy of paranoia, three films that follow the disintegrating minds of obsessed men. There's his first film, the abstract black and white film Following (1998), followed by the classic backwards-thriller Memento (2000) and the remake of a better film, Insomnia.\n\nBut luckily for the sake of this list, nearly every film under the directorial belt of Christopher Nolan has elements of a thriller. Even The Prestige (2006), Tenet (2020), and The Dark Knight (2008) fits the mold, albeit to lesser extents. Whether you've watched those films ad nauseam or you've just heard about them today, Nolan always hits home with his movies, and that's especially true with his thrillers.\n\n## 18 \n\n                            Jean-Pierre Melville\n\nComacico\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector Jean-Pierre Melville wore many hats, from French New Wave godfather to master of the French Resistance and chronicler of spiritual ennui. Among his many different types of films were a handful of absolutely perfect and very French thrillers.\n\nFrom the delightful heist film Bob le Flambeur (1956) and stylish, super cool masterpiece Le Samouraï (1967), to the more complicated noir thrillers Le Cercle Rouge (1970) and Le Doulos (1962), whenever Melville tackled a thriller, he perfected it.\n\n## 17 \n\n                            Michael Haneke\n\nConcorde-Castle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwo of the greatest thrillers of their respective regions are Funny Games (1997) from Austria and Caché (2005) from France, and they were both directed by Michael Haneke. The former follows a family staying in their vacation home when an unexpected pair of visitors arrive: two young men who initiate the titular games of sadistic and horrific nature. They torture the family mentally and physically, with the intrigue of the plot being rivaled by the mastery of behind-the-scenes elements.\n\nRelated: Best Michael Haneke Movies, Ranked\n\nThe same can be said for Caché with Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche. It's just as renowned as Funny Games, though it pales slightly in comparison in hindsight. Nonetheless, both films are absolute masterclasses of the thriller genre, and they render Haneke an essential director regardless of decade or region. Inflections of the genre can also be seen in his tense films The White Ribbon, Benny's Game, The Seventh Continent, and Code Unknown.\n\n## 16 \n\n                            Denis Villeneuve\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the more recent directors on the list is Denis Villeneuve, who released two masterful thrillers in the same year: Enemy (2013) and Prisoners (2013). The former is highly underrated, while Prisoners is one of the best thrillers you're ever likely to see. And what's more, both films feature Jake Gyllenhaal in back-to-back show-stealing performances.\n\nRelated: Every Jake Gyllenhaal Thriller Movie, Ranked\n\nVilleneuve's next thriller will likely ring a few more bells, as Sicario (2015) has gained great traction in recent years with sequels and home-video releases. It follows FBI Special Agent Kate Marcer, who's played by Emily Blunt as she attempts to stop the happenings of a Mexican drug cartel. It's a fantastic film, and what helps land Villeneuve at number twelve is that projects such as Blade Runner 2049 (2017) may not be thrillers, but they surely feature elements thereof.\n\n## 15 \n\n                            John Frankenheimer\n\nUnited Artists\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore modern film fans may not recognize the name John Frankenheimer. However, he's directed many masterpieces and a couple of the biggest films to ever hit the silver screen, and one falls in the category of this list. Of course, that's The Manchurian Candidate (1962) with Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, and Angela Lansbury. It follows Harvey's character, a Vietnam War veteran who is brainwashed by communists and sent back to the United States as a sleeper agent.\n\nYou're probably familiar with that project, but he then released the incredibly tense 1964 film The Train, starring Burt Lancaster and an amazing Jeanne Moreau. A few years down the line, Frankenheimer released Seconds (1966), a disturbing classic that was very underrated, despite its spot in the National Film Registry. Frankenheimer's next two thrillers made up for its paucity of popularity: French Connection II (1975), followed by Ronin (1998). Those are two more solid outings that on any given day could land this director within the top ten.\n\n## 14 \n\n                            Bong Joon-ho\n\nCJ Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmerican audiences will mostly be familiar with the name Bong Joon-ho thanks to his Academy Award-winning film Parasite (2019) from a few years back. That's one of the greatest recent films, easily among the best of its decade, and it will without a doubt stand the test of time. But this director is gloriously unhinged, writing and directing some of the most mind-bending journeys you're ever likely to experience even from his feature-length debut.\n\nBarking Dogs Never Bite (2000) isn't a thriller in the classic sense, but it without a doubt features elements thereof. However, his sophomore film, Memories of Murder (2003), is a brilliant crime thriller, a police procedural about detectives tracking down a serial killer. It should frankly go down as Joon-ho's magnum opus, and perhaps the greatest thriller film of that decade.\n\nBut Joon-ho hardly let up from there. The Host (2006) is similar to Barking Dogs Never Bite in that it isn't quite a thriller, but it sure comes close. Mother (2009) and Snowpiercer (2013) undoubtedly fit the bill, with each film in tandem landing Joon-ho in the list.\n\n## 13 \n\n                            William Friedkin\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo be frank, The French Connection (1971) is one of the greatest films ever made. With Gene Hackman in the lead role and Roy Scheider as his co-star, those two juggernauts of the industry truly hit international acclaim as NYPD detectives Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo, respectively. And the film as a whole is as legendary as they come, with several golden statuettes from the Oscars to its name, and even a rank among the National Film Registry thanks to the preservation by the Library of Congress.\n\nThat entry by itself is enough to land anyone on the list of greatest thriller directors. But luckily for William Friedkin, his spot is bolstered by several other nerve-racking adventures such as Sorcerer (1977), Cruising (1980), To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), and even more recent films such as the brilliant Bug (2006) and Killer Joe (2011). He has a few duds in the mix, but most of his thrillers meet their marks. What helps Friedkin in the long run is The French Connection — if it weren't for The Exorcist (1973), that would easily be his masterpiece.\n\n## 12 \n\n                            The Coen Brothers\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere's a very specific type of thrill to the Coen brothers' films. It's offbeat, surprisingly violent, often arbitrary, and realistic despite the eccentric characters involved. Blood SImple (1984), Miller's Crossing (1990), Fargo (1996), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001), No Country for Old Men (2007) — these are all excellent films with a very specific kind of thriller aesthetic, which can also be found lurking beneath the surface of their comedies like Burn After Reading (2008) and Raising Arizona (1987).\n\n## 11 \n\n                            Park Chan-wook\n\nShow East\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf you've at any point hopped aboard the hype train of South Korean cinema, you've without a doubt seen a title or two among the filmography of Park Chan-wook. Since the turn of the 21st century, he's been pumping out some of his region's most renowned titles, from Joint Security Area (2000) and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) to Oldboy (2003) and The Handmaiden (2016). Those are perhaps is four best and most recognizable movies, and they all fall neatly within the film category at hand.\n\nJoint Security Area is an action hybrid that stars Song Kang-ho, one of the greatest actors in South Korea's history, while Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance marks the beginning of his revered revenge trilogy. It was followed by Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, without a doubt among the top two or three most heard-of films from its region, regardless of decade or director, with Lady Vengeance (2005) perfectly culminating the three projects. And thanks to other films such as Stoker (2013), there's no denying Chan-wook's films rank among the best ever thriller directors.\n\n## 10 \n\n                            Orson Welles\n\nRKO Radio Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough The Third Man (1949) was directed by someone who appears much later in the list, it's commonly thought of as an Orson Welles movie, with the legitimate director not getting credit in that regard from less hardcore fans. But more on him in a bit. As for Welles: his first ever thriller, The Stranger (1946) was a masterpiece, following a high-ranking fugitive of the Nazi regime. It's a well-made thriller noir from its first frame, and began a dozen years of brilliant thrillers. Depending on your taste, he could understandably be number one or two on this list, but he stacks up here for us.\n\nAside from the groundbreaking Citizen Kane (1941) and Magnificent Ambersons (1942), Welles became largely associated with noir thrillers, such as the masterful The Lady From Shanghai (1947), Confidential Report (also known as Mr. Arkardin, from 1955), and Touch of Evil (1958).\n\nThe Touch of Evil is cited by pundits of the industry as one of the greatest movies ever made. Its thrilling nature is on full display from the very first scene, with Welles solidifying himself as an undisputed master of suspense. While he'd completely abandon the thriller in favor of more experimental subjects, the 12 years he spent making thrillers were enough to ensure his place as one of the best.\n\n## 9 \n\n                            Roman Polanski\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLike Haneke, this director also made two of the most revered thrillers their regions had to offer, starting with Knife in the Water (1962). A Polish-language film, it chronicles a young male hitchhiker who accompanies a married couple on a boating trip, only for the former party to initiate a series of strange head-to-heads. The sequences build in tension, with Knife in the Water frequently being cited as perhaps the best Polish thriller ever made. It remains the only Roman Polanski film that features dialogue in his native language, and the project holds up wonderfully several decades later.\n\nThe other legendary thriller directed by Polanski is Chinatown (1974), starring Jack Nicholson as Jake Gettys, a private detective. That's among the greatest and most well-known movies ever made, and like Knife in the Water, it remains among the best thrillers its region has ever seen.\n\nBut those are far from the only thrillers that Polanski has to offer. Repulsion (1965) and Cul-de-sac (1966) are great early outings, while Death and the Maiden (1994) and The Ninth Gate (1999) continued his reputation in the genre. The Ghost Writer (2010) puts the perfect capstone on his career as a legendary thriller director.\n\n## 8 \n\n                            Carol Reed\n\nBritish Lion Films\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Fallen Idol (1948) and The Third Man (1949) are two of the greatest British films of all time, and fans might have expected Reed to place even higher on the list because of it. But arguably the most famous entry throughout his career is Oliver! (1968), a period musical. No disrespect there, but it's far from a thriller, and the rest of the directors essentially made careers with the latter ilk of cinema.\n\nThe Third Man is among the greatest film noirs ever made, and it garnered Reed a nomination at the Academy Awards for Best Director, as did The Fallen Idol in the year prior. And although he came up short at both ceremonies, the projects did receive back-to-back wins for Best British Film at the BAFTAs. Reed's noir thriller Odd Man Out actually won the very first BAFTA for Best British Film, so he continued to justify the precedent he set. Along with the wonderful Night Train to Munich, Reed's position here is utterly warranted.\n\n## 7 \n\n                            Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nCinédis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile hardcore film fans are likely caught off guard by Henri-Georges Clouzot not being within the list's top five, it's once again worth noting that, like Carol Reed, he branched out to other genres a bit more frequently than the directors that are to follow. He's made straight-up dramas, a couple comedies, and even a documentary (about Pablo Picasso!) along the way. But like the rest of the filmmakers on this list, Clouzot's thrillers are among the greatest in cinematic history.\n\nClouzot's second film, Le Corbeau (1942), is a wonderfully efficient little thriller, but it was The Wages of Fear (1953) that put him on the international map, while Les Diaboliques (1955) only saw further success in this regard. The former is an incredible suspense film, while the latter is perhaps his best project regardless of genre.\n\nSpecifically, Les Diaboliques is a psychological thriller that mixes in elements of horror. It was highly influential, even inspiring the number one director on the list when he made one of his most important films. Clouzot is undeniably among the all-time greats of thriller directors, and on any given fan's list, he could place even higher than number seven.\n\n## 6 \n\n                            Martin Scorsese\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSure, you may not speak about Martin Scorsese and the thriller genre in the same breath. But it depends on how you define a thriller. Obviously, in Cape Fear (1991), his greatest collaborator, Robert De Niro, sends chills down the audience's spines with every line uttered as Max Cady. And Scorsese's other famous collaborator, Leonardo DiCaprio, starred in the director's follow-up crime thriller, The Departed (2006).\n\nRelated: Best Martin Scorsese Movies, Ranked\n\nBoth films are remakes, and they're arguably better than their original versions, and The Departed cleaned up at the 79th Academy Awards. Then, there's Shutter Island (2010). A true fan-favorite among Scorsese's already-famous filmography, Shutter Island with Leo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo features thrilling twists unlike few films you'll read about today. And none of that is to even broach the subject of Taxi Driver (1976), one of the greatest thrillers ever made, if you consider it as such.\n\n## 5 \n\n                            David Lynch\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhatever you say about David Lynch, it's clear that he's been primarily working within the thriller genre his whole career, even if that means primarily deconstructing it in disturbing postmodern ways. Eraserhead (1977) is more horror than anything, while Blue Velvet (1986) falls perfectly into the thriller category. Specifically, it's a neo-noir mystery thriller, and it's one of Lynch's greatest films all these years down the line.\n\nLost Highway (1997) is another intriguing film of Lynchian proportions, while Mulholland Drive (2001) is commonly cited among the greatest films ever made, especially of the 21st century. And Lynch was by no means done from there. He followed that up in valiant fashion with Inland Empire (2006), which boasts one of the most star-studded casts you're likely to read about today. Whether you resonate with his idiosyncratic style of filmmaking or not, there's no denying the legacy built by Lynch and his thrillers.\n\n## 4 \n\n                            David Fincher\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwo of the greatest thriller directors from America are both named David. Coincidence? Absolutely. But just edging out Lynch on the list is David Fincher, who first saw critical acclaim in Hollywood by directing the crime-thriller Se7en (1995). That was his second outing following the mediocre Alien 3 (1992), with Se7en being the far superior film. In fact, it's commonly cited among the greatest films not just of its genre, but also of its decade. He followed up in underrated fashion thanks to The Game (1997) with Michael Douglas.\n\nRelated: 8 Movies Almost Made by David Fincher\n\nThen, he made arguably the most important film of his career: Fight Club (1999), starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. It's far from the best film under Fincher's belt, though, and it's not even the best thriller. That title goes either to the aforementioned Se7en, or to a film called Zodiac (2007) with Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the best thrillers of this century.\n\nAnd none of this touches upon other seminal Fincher films such as Panic Room (2002) with Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, or Gone Girl (2014) with Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. To top things off, the upcoming film The Killer (2023) will see a return to thrilling form for Fincher after a series of prestige dramas. It stars Michael Fassbender in the titular role, and it's bound to meet expectations. Whenever he directs a thriller, David Fincher always hits home.\n\n## 3 \n\n                            Brian De Palma\n\nFilmways Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThough perhaps best known for his gangster flicks with Al Pacino such as Scarface (1983) and Carlito's Way (1993), American filmmaker Brian De Palma is also recognized as one of cinema's greatest directors of thrillers; it's been his bread and butter.\n\nHis first ever feature, Murder a la Mod (1968), is a murder-mystery, while he truly delved into the genre in the next decade with Hitchcock-inspired masterpieces like Sisters (1972) and the great Obsession (1976). The latter film follows Cliff Robertson's character who falls in love with an exact look-alike of his deceased wife, who's played by Geneviève Bujold. It's a great film, as were his horror-thrillers of the decade, Carrie (1976) and The Fury (1978).\n\nBut in the 1980s, De Palma solidified himself as an all-time great in this regard by making Dressed to Kill (1980), Blow Out (1981), and Body Double (1984). Those are three of the most underrated films of their decade, with Blow Out in particular going down perhaps as De Palma's magnum opus.\n\nAfter his foray into gangster films, he continued to make excellent thrillers like the very first Mission: Impossible film and some incredibly divisive films that some consider brilliant and others consider exploitive trash (Snake Eyes, Femme Fatale, and Passion). We lean toward their brilliance, though none were on par with his earlier works.\n\n## 2 \n\n                            Fritz Lang\n\nVereinigte Star-Film GmbH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEveryone should be familiar with the name Fritz Lang, if not just for his influence on the science fiction genre with the release of Metropolis (1927). But his seminal noir precursor, M (1931), is perhaps the single most important thriller ever made, and would be one of the earliest thriller masterpieces if not for Spies (1928) — also directed by Lang.\n\nAfter M, he released another prominent thriller called The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933), a phenomenal film that followed Lang's iconic Mabuse character. It'd take several more years, but he went on a thriller spree in the 1940s after fleeing Nazi Germany for Hollywood and making projects like Man Hunt (1941), The Woman in the Window (1944), and Cloak and Dagger (1946).\n\nIn the decade thereafter, he released another famous film, the noir masterpiece The Big Heat (1953), only to round out his career with a sequel: The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960). The number one spot on this list was set in stone from the beginning, but frankly, so was this penultimate pick in Lang.\n\n## 1 \n\n                            Alfred Hitchcock\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWas there ever any doubt? Whether you want to call Psycho (1960) a horror film or a thriller, it hardly matters. Alfred Hitchcock is the undisputed king of thrills, and he will likely never be topped. He essentially created half of the storytelling techniques and cinematic tropes featured in Hollywood thrillers today, and the majority of filmmakers on this very list cite Hitchcock as a direct influence.\n\nMost directors to ever be born after Alfred Hitchcock would call him inspirational, to be frank, with his name's value transcending this list entirely. From Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo (1958) to North by Northwest (1959) and The Birds (1963), some of the greatest thrillers ever made were directed by the filmmaker at hand.\n\nAnd he made even more classics like Strangers on a Train (1951), Dial M for Murder (1954), or The Man Who Knew Too Much (both 1934 and 1956). And frankly, that's still only scratching the surface of his vast, critically acclaimed filmography. Without any doubt, Hitchcock deserves this spot at number one, and retains the moniker of \"master of suspense\" to this day.\n\n- Movie Lists\n- Thriller\n\nRecommended\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Every Live-Action Lex Luthor, Ranked\n\nAbout a dozen actors have taken on the role across movies and television and captured Lex Luthor’s arrogance and villainy against the Man of Tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The Most Annoying Characters in Otherwise Perfect Movies\n\nThese movies are near perfection, though one annoying character has left a negative impression on some fans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### 8 Best Stephen King Movies You Can Stream on Prime\n\nThere are tons of Stephen King movies for anyone looking to explore the author's adaptations, and Prime Video is a good place to start.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### 14 Things That Happen in Every MCU Movie\n\nMCU films follow a set formula—quips, exposition dumps, CGI battles, vague villains, and post-credits teases—balancing fun with predictability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### How To Watch Every ‘Final Destination’ Movie in the Order That Makes the Most Sense\n\nWith a sixth 'Final Destination' movie hitting theaters soon, here's how to watch every movie in the franchise in order.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Jean-Claude Van Damme’s 10 Most Action-Packed Martial Arts Movies\n\nAs a real-life martial artist, Jean-Claude Van Damme has always preferred movies with lots of kicks and punches.

It's a fantastic film, and what helps land Villeneuve at number twelve is that projects such as <name>Blade Runner 2049</name> (2017) may not be thrillers, but they surely feature elements thereof.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>15</header>\n            <name>John Frankenheimer</name>\n            <additional_information>United Artists</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                More modern film fans may not recognize the name <name>John Frankenheimer</name>. However, he's directed many masterpieces and a couple of the biggest films to ever hit the silver screen, and one falls in the category of this list. Of course, that's <name>The Manchurian Candidate</name> (1962) with <name>Frank Sinatra</name>, <name>Laurence Harvey</name>, and <name>Angela Lansbury</name>. It follows Harvey's character, a Vietnam War veteran who is brainwashed by communists and sent back to the United States as a sleeper agent.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                You're probably familiar with that project, but he then released the incredibly tense <name>The Train</name> (1964), starring <name>Burt Lancaster</name> and an amazing <name>Jeanne Moreau</name>. A few years down the line, Frankenheimer released <name>Seconds</name> (1966), a disturbing classic that was very underrated, despite its spot in the National Film Registry. Frankenheimer's next two thrillers made up for its paucity of popularity: <name>French Connection II</name> (1975), followed by <name>Ronin</name> (1998). Those are two more solid outings that on any given day could land this director within the top ten.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>14</header>\n            <name>Bong Joon-ho</name>\n            <additional_information>CJ Entertainment</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                American audiences will mostly be familiar with the name <name>Bong Joon-ho</name> thanks to his Academy Award-winning film <name>Parasite</name> (2019) from a few years back. That's one of the greatest recent films, easily among the best of its decade, and it will without a doubt stand the test of time. But this director is gloriously unhinged, writing and directing some of the most mind-bending journeys you're ever likely to experience even from his feature-length debut.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                <name>Barking Dogs Never Bite</name> (2000) isn't a thriller in the classic sense, but it without a doubt features elements thereof. However, his sophomore film, <name>Memories of Murder</name> (2003), is a brilliant crime thriller, a police procedural about detectives tracking down a serial killer. It should frankly go down as Joon-ho's magnum opus, and perhaps the greatest thriller film of that decade.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                But Joon-ho hardly let up from there. <name>The Host</name> (2006) is similar to <name>Barking Dogs Never Bite</name> in that it isn't quite a thriller, but it sure comes close. <name>Mother</name> (2009) and <name>Snowpiercer</name> (2013) undoubtedly fit the bill, with each film in tandem landing Joon-ho in the list.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>13</header>\n            <name>William Friedkin</name>\n            <additional_information>20th Century Fox</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                To be frank, <name>The French Connection</name> (1971) is one of the greatest films ever made.

He has a few duds in the mix, but most of his thrillers meet their marks. What helps Friedkin in the long run is <name>The French Connection</name> — if it weren't for <name>The Exorcist</name> (1973), that would easily be his masterpiece.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>12</header>\n            <name>The Coen Brothers</name>\n            <additional_information>20th Century Fox</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                There's a very specific type of thrill to the <name>Coen brothers</name>' films.

Since the turn of the 21st century, he's been pumping out some of his region's most renowned titles, from <name>Joint Security Area</name> (2000) and <name>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</name> (2002) to <name>Oldboy</name> (2003) and <name>The Handmaiden</name> (2016).

It was followed by <name>Park Chan-wook</name>'s <name>Oldboy</name>, without a doubt among the top two or three most heard-of films from its region, regardless of decade or director, with <name>Lady Vengeance</name> (2005) perfectly culminating the three projects. And thanks to other films such as <name>Stoker</name> (2013), there's no denying Chan-wook's films rank among the best ever thriller directors.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>10</header>\n            <name>Orson Welles</name>\n            <additional_information>RKO Radio Pictures</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                Although <name>The Third Man</name> (1949) was directed by someone who appears much later in the list, it's commonly thought of as an <name>Orson Welles</name> movie, with the legitimate director not getting credit in that regard from less hardcore fans. But more on him in a bit. As for Welles: his first ever thriller, <name>The Stranger</name> (1946) was a masterpiece, following a high-ranking fugitive of the Nazi regime. It's a well-made thriller noir from its first frame, and began a dozen years of brilliant thrillers. Depending on your taste, he could understandably be number one or two on this list, but he stacks up here for us.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Aside from the groundbreaking <name>Citizen Kane</name> (1941) and <name>Magnificent Ambersons</name> (1942), Welles became largely associated with noir thrillers, such as the masterful <name>The Lady From Shanghai</name> (1947), <name>Confidential Report</name> (also known as <name>Mr. Arkardin</name>, from 1955), and <name>Touch of Evil</name> (1958).\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                The <name>Touch of Evil</name> is cited by pundits of the industry as one of the greatest movies ever made. Its thrilling nature is on full display from the very first scene, with Welles solidifying himself as an undisputed master of suspense. While he'd completely abandon the thriller in favor of more experimental subjects, the 12 years he spent making thrillers were enough to ensure his place as one of the best.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>9</header>\n            <name>Roman Polanski</name>\n            <additional_information>Paramount Pictures</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                Like Haneke, this director also made two of the most revered thrillers their regions had to offer, starting with <name>Knife in the Water</name> (1962). A Polish-language film, it chronicles a young male hitchhiker who accompanies a married couple on a boating trip, only for the former party to initiate a series of strange head-to-heads. The sequences build in tension, with <name>Knife in the Water</name> frequently being cited as perhaps the best Polish thriller ever made. It remains the only <name>Roman Polanski</name> film that features dialogue in his native language, and the project holds up wonderfully several decades later.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                The other legendary thriller directed by <name>Polanski</name> is <name>Chinatown</name> (1974), starring <name>Jack Nicholson</name> as <name>Jake Gettys</name>, a private detective. That's among the greatest and most well-known movies ever made, and like <name>Knife in the Water</name>, it remains among the best thrillers its region has ever seen.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                But those are far from the only thrillers that <name>Polanski</name> has to offer. <name>Repulsion</name> (1965) and <name>Cul-de-sac</name> (1966) are great early outings, while <name>Death and the Maiden</name> (1994) and <name>The Ninth Gate</name> (1999) continued his reputation in the genre. <name>The Ghost Writer</name> (2010) puts the perfect capstone on his career as a legendary thriller director.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>8</header>\n            <name>Carol Reed</name>\n            <additional_information>British Lion Films</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                <name>The Fallen Idol</name> (1948) and <name>The Third Man</name> (1949) are two of the greatest British films of all time, and fans might have expected Reed to place even higher on the list because of it. But arguably the most famous entry throughout his career is <name>Oliver!</name> (1968), a period musical. No disrespect there, but it's far from a thriller, and the rest of the directors essentially made careers with the latter ilk of cinema.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                <name>The Third Man</name> is among the greatest film noirs ever made, and it garnered Reed a nomination at the Academy Awards for Best Director, as did <name>The Fallen Idol</name> in the year prior. And although he came up short at both ceremonies, the projects did receive back-to-back wins for Best British Film at the BAFTAs. Reed's noir thriller <name>Odd Man Out</name> actually won the very first BAFTA for Best British Film, so he continued to justify the precedent he set. Along with the wonderful <name>Night Train to Munich</name>, Reed's position here is utterly warranted.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>7</header>\n            <name>Henri-Georges Clouzot</name>\n            <additional_information>Cinédis</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                While hardcore film fans are likely caught off guard by <name>Henri-Georges Clouzot</name> not being within the list's top five, it's once again worth noting that, like <name>Carol Reed</name>, he branched out to other genres a bit more frequently than the directors that are to follow. He's made straight-up dramas, a couple comedies, and even a documentary (about <name>Pablo Picasso</name>!) along the way. But like the rest of the filmmakers on this list, Clouzot's thrillers are among the greatest in cinematic history.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Clouzot's second film, <name>Le Corbeau</name> (1942), is a wonderfully efficient little thriller, but it was <name>The Wages of Fear</name> (1953) that put him on the international map, while <name>Les Diaboliques</name> (1955) only saw further success in this regard. The former is an incredible suspense film, while the latter is perhaps his best project regardless of genre.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Specifically, <name>Les Diaboliques</name> is a psychological thriller that mixes in elements of horror. It was highly influential, even inspiring the number one director on the list when he made one of his most important films. Clouzot is undeniably among the all-time greats of thriller directors, and on any given fan's list, he could place even higher than number seven.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>6</header>\n            <name>Martin Scorsese</name>\n            <additional_information>Columbia Pictures</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                Sure, you may not speak about <name>Martin Scorsese</name> and the thriller genre in the same breath. But it depends on how you define a thriller. Obviously, in <name>Cape Fear</name> (1991), his greatest collaborator, <name>Robert De Niro</name>, sends chills down the audience's spines with every line uttered as <name>Max Cady</name>. And Scorsese's other famous collaborator, <name>Leonardo DiCaprio</name>, starred in the director's follow-up crime thriller, <name>The Departed</name> (2006).\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Related: Best <name>Martin Scorsese</name> Movies, Ranked\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Both films are remakes, and they're arguably better than their original versions, and <name>The Departed</name> cleaned up at the 79th Academy Awards. Then, there's <name>Shutter Island</name> (2010). A true fan-favorite among Scorsese's already-famous filmography, <name>Shutter Island</name> with <name>Leo DiCaprio</name> and <name>Mark Ruffalo</name> features thrilling <twists_and_turns>twists</twists_and_turns> unlike few films you'll read about today. And none of that is to even broach the subject of <name>Taxi Driver</name> (1976), one of the greatest thrillers ever made, if you consider it as such.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>5</header>\n            <name>David Lynch</name>\n            <additional_information>Universal Pictures</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                Whatever you say about <name>David Lynch</name>, it's clear that he's been primarily working within the thriller genre his whole career, even if that means primarily deconstructing it in disturbing postmodern ways. <name>Eraserhead</name> (1977) is more horror than anything, while <name>Blue Velvet</name> (1986) falls perfectly into the thriller category. Specifically, it's a neo-noir mystery thriller, and it's one of Lynch's greatest films all these years down the line.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                <name>Lost Highway</name> (1997) is another intriguing film of Lynchian proportions, while <name>Mulholland Drive</name> (2001) is commonly cited among the greatest films ever made, especially of the 21st century. And Lynch was by no means done from there. He followed that up in valiant fashion with <name>Inland Empire</name> (2006), which boasts one of the most star-studded casts you're likely to read about today. Whether you resonate with his idiosyncratic style of filmmaking or not, there's no denying the legacy built by Lynch and his thrillers.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>4</header>\n            <name>David Fincher</name>\n            <additional_information>New Line Cinema</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                Two of the greatest thriller directors from America are both named David. Coincidence? Absolutely. But just edging out Lynch on the list is <name>David Fincher</name>, who first saw critical acclaim in Hollywood by directing the crime-thriller <name>Se7en</name> (1995). That was his second outing following the mediocre <name>Alien 3</name> (1992), with <name>Se7en</name> being the far superior film. In fact, it's commonly cited among the greatest films not just of its genre, but also of its decade. He followed up in underrated fashion thanks to <name>The Game</name> (1997) with <name>Michael Douglas</name>.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Related: 8 Movies Almost Made by <name>David Fincher</name>\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Then, he made arguably the most important film of his career: <name>Fight Club</name> (1999), starring <name>Edward Norton</name> and <name>Brad Pitt</name>. It's far from the best film under Fincher's belt, though, and it's not even the best thriller. That title goes either to the aforementioned <name>Se7en</name>, or to a film called <name>Zodiac</name> (2007) with <name>Jake Gyllenhaal</name>, one of the best thrillers of this century.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                And none of this touches upon other seminal Fincher films such as <name>Panic Room</name> (2002) with <name>Jodie Foster</name> and <name>Kristen Stewart</name>, <name>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</name> (2011) with <name>Daniel Craig</name> and <name>Rooney Mara</name>, or <name>Gone Girl</name> (2014) with <name>Ben Affleck</name> and <name>Rosamund Pike</name>. To top things off, the upcoming film <name>The Killer</name> (2023) will see a return to thrilling form for Fincher after a series of prestige dramas.

The latter film follows <name>Cliff Robertson</name>'s character who falls in love with an exact look-alike of his deceased wife, who's played by <name>Geneviève Bujold</name>.

Those are three of the most underrated films of their decade, with <name>Blow Out</name> in particular going down perhaps as <name>De Palma</name>'s magnum opus.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                After his foray into gangster films, he continued to make excellent thrillers like the very first <name>Mission: Impossible</name> film and some incredibly divisive films that some consider brilliant and others consider exploitive trash (<name>Snake Eyes</name>, <name>Femme Fatale</name>, and <name>Passion</name>).

But his seminal noir precursor, <name>M</name> (1931), is perhaps the single most important thriller ever made, and would be one of the earliest thriller masterpieces if not for <name>Spies</name> (1928) — also directed by Lang.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                After <name>M</name>, he released another prominent thriller called <name>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</name> (1933), a phenomenal film that followed Lang's iconic Mabuse character. It'd take several more years, but he went on a thriller spree in the 1940s after fleeing Nazi Germany for Hollywood and making projects like <name>Man Hunt</name> (1941), <name>The Woman in the Window</name> (1944), and <name>Cloak and Dagger</name> (1946).\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                In the decade thereafter, he released another famous film, the noir masterpiece <name>The Big Heat</name> (1953), only to round out his career with a sequel: <name>The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse</name> (1960). The number one spot on this list was set in stone from the beginning, but frankly, so was this penultimate pick in Lang.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            <header>1</header>\n            <name>Alfred Hitchcock</name>\n            <additional_information>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</additional_information>\n            <paragraph>\n                Was there ever any doubt?

He essentially created half of the storytelling techniques and cinematic tropes featured in Hollywood thrillers today, and the majority of filmmakers on this very list cite Hitchcock as a direct influence.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                Most directors to ever be born after <name>Alfred Hitchcock</name> would call him inspirational, to be frank, with his name's value transcending this list entirely. From <name>Rear Window</name> (1954) and <name>Vertigo</name> (1958) to <name>North by Northwest</name> (1959) and <name>The Birds</name> (1963), some of the greatest thrillers ever made were directed by the filmmaker at hand.\n            </paragraph>\n            <paragraph>\n                And he made even more classics like <name>Strangers on a Train</name> (1951), <name>Dial M for Murder</name> (1954), or <name>The Man Who Knew Too Much</name> (both 1934 and 1956). And frankly, that's still only scratching the surface of his vast, critically acclaimed filmography. Without any doubt, <name>Hitchcock</name> deserves this spot at number one, and retains the moniker of \"master of suspense\" to this day.\n            </paragraph>\n        </section>\n    </content>\n</article>\n```\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have wrapped relevant segments with the appropriate XML tags based on the attributes defined in the ADT.

Brown Movies, Ranked\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### 6 Discontinued Oscar Categories That Need To Return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The 10 Best Oscar-Winning Musicals, Ranked\n\nSign in to your  account\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDo you love a good psychological thriller? Do you often find yourself trolling the internet for new thrills to watch? If so, you’re in luck. Rotten Tomatoes has a list geared for the average psychological horror enjoyer, specifically for those who got a kick out of Martin Scorcese’s Shutter Island.\n\nRELATED: The Best Psychological Thrillers on Netflix Right Now\n\nPsychological thrillers are mind-bending and unforgettable rides, leaving you questioning everything, from your own motives to those of your next-door neighbor. They're also genre-bending, featuring twisted ballet dancers to deceptive train adventures: there’s something for everyone.\n\n## 'The Girl On The Train' (2016)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRachel Watson (Emily Blunt) commutes to work on the train every day, catching glimpses of a seemingly perfect couple on the street she used to live on, Megan and Scott. One day, she witnesses a shocking event unfolding in their home and soon finds herself in a twisted investigation to find out the truth.\n\nThe Girl On The Train has it all — toxic ex-husbands, affairs, scandals, inner turmoil, alcoholism, and more. While the film struggles to toe the line between thriller and melodrama, it provides an overall pleasant viewing experience for those who are fans of the genre.\n\n## 'The Game' (1997)\n\nImage via PolyGram Films\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDo you want to play a game? Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is hesitant at first. A successful banker has lunch with his estranged brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), presenting him with an odd gift of a real-life, personalized game. He reluctantly accepts and soon finds himself fearful for his own life.\n\nRELATED: From 'Dead Man Walking' to 'Milk': 9 Essential Sean Penn Performances\n\nNothing is as it seems in this twisted tale of money, power, and everything in between — you’ll be left guessing right up until its climactic finale.\n\n## 'Black Swan' (2010)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf you’re a fan of psychological thrillers and good old-fashioned competition, look no further than Black Swan. Nina (Natalie Portman) is cast as the replacement prima ballerina for her company’s rendition of Black Swan, playing both the role of the Black Swan and White Swan.\n\nRELATED: 'Black Swan' Ending Explained: The Price of Perfection\n\nWhat comes next is a series of twists and turns, rivalries, deception, and cracked psyches. Black Swan is the type of movie that is so gutsy that you’ll need to see it more than once to fully wrap your head around it.\n\n## 'Gone Girl' (2014)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFormer New York-based writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) seem like the perfect picture of a married couple. When Amy suddenly goes missing on their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick finds himself trapped in a whirlwind as the key suspect in the case.\n\nSoon, the image of the pair crumbles, and we see Nick and Amy for who they really are. Secrets are revealed, old faces return, and we soon discover that nothing is as it seems for Amy Dunne and her twisted tale.\n\n## 'Inception' (2010)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInception is a Christopher Nolan classic with Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead as Dom Cobb, a man who can enter people’s dreams and steal secrets from their subconscious. He is soon tasked with what seems impossible — planting an idea in someone’s mind. What follows is a tale of pulling off the impossible, destroyed relationships, deadly enemies, and everything in between — with an ending shocking enough to keep you up for days.\n\nFans of DiCaprio will love this psychological thriller, also starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Elliot Page. With a 91% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes, the film was a smashing success, earning its place on this list.\n\n## 'Memento' (2000)\n\nImage via Summit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty, however, of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.\n\nMemento is another Christopher Nolan film, with a 94% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes. The film makes you think you know what’s happening, and suddenly, you don’t — a testament to its twisted nature.\n\n## 'The Machinist' (2004)\n\nImage via Paramount Vantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirected by Brad Anderson comes The Machinist, a film starring Christian Bale and Michael Ironside. After factory worker Trevor Reznik (Bale) causes a work accident that injures his coworker, he falls deeper and deeper into psychosis.\n\nThe Machinist is a brilliant, albeit twisted tale that shows insomnia's effects on a person. This film will leave you second-guessing everything that you know, both about yourself and about those around you.\n\n## 'Secret Window' (2004)\n\nImage via Sony Pictures Releasing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile divorcing his wife, writer Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) relocates to upstate New York for some solitude in his remote cabin. Soon after, he is accused of plagiarism by farmer John Shooter (John Turturro). Soon, these accusations devolve into violence.\n\nSecret Window is directed by David Koepp, and Johnny Depp's performance manages to take a tired concept and transform it into a mind-bending, fresh perspective on the twisted nature of writing and credit.\n\n## 'Changeling' (2008)\n\nImage Via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet in 1928, this Clint Eastwood-directed film centers on single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie). She arrives home in Los Angeles to find her son missing, who then miraculously reappears five months later. The problem, however — is that this isn't her son.\n\nChangeling is perfect for those who find themselves questioning superiority around them. The film takes you through a journey of exposing the corruption of the LAPD, where nothing is ever as it really seems.\n\n## 'Identity' (2003)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentity follows ten people seeking refuge in an isolated motel in Nevada during a brutal storm: however, they suddenly find themselves targeted by a vicious serial killer.\n\nLimo driver Ed Dakota (John Cusack) commits to discovering the identity of this serial killer and is ready to do whatever it takes to do so. Of course, he is in for danger and uncertainty at every turn, not knowing what to expect or who is after them all.\n\nKEEP READING:The 25 Best Psychological Thrillers of All Time\n\n- Movie\n- Shutter Island\n- Rotten Tomatoes\n\nRecommended\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The 10 Best Amanda Seyfried Movies, Ranked\n\n\"I'm a mouse.
