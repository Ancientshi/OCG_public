It could help you develop...\n\nLoneliness: a feeling many of us are familiar with, or feel suffocated and isolated by. Millions of people each day can feel alone whilst surrounded by people, like being a ghost amongst their peers and isolated beyond their understanding. Loneliness is a horrible feeling that I can guarantee everyone has felt at least once in their lifetime, no matter whether they have loads of friends or not.\n\nExploring the sentiment of loneliness, I have found multiple depictions of it through movies and tv shows. Personally, seeing my favourite character, who I believe to be strong as I watch them, suffering with something that I also suffer with, is refreshing and I no longer feel so alone.\n\nHere are some examples of loneliness in tv and film to show that you are not alone, and that loneliness isn't such a foreign concept. I have specifically chosen more niche movies and tv shows to talk about, as hopefully it will inspire you to watch something less mainstream and discover something new:\n\n### THE LIGHTHOUSE (15)\n\n“Boredom makes men to villains.”\n\nThe Lighthouse, featuring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, is a visually stunning and revolutionary movie in black and white that shows two characters and their journey whilst stuck together in a lighthouse. Whilst they may have each other, both men feel alone and tensions rise as they fight to keep their sanity. This is a unique look at loneliness in a character.\n\n### HER (15)\n\n“We are only here briefly, and in this moment, I want to allow myself joy.”\n\nStarring Joaquin Phoenix, Her is about a lonely man, Theodore, who finds love in the strangest of places. Theodore is shown living his life and daily routine whilst suffering through overwhelming loneliness and how he copes. This is an incredibly beautiful and strange movie that captures the essence of loneliness really well, and the abundance of technology in our lives and how it’s sometimes hard to separate fantasy from reality.\n\n### LEGION (15)\n\n“When a plate breaks, you don’t fix it, you just get another plate.”\n\nCinemas in the last decade have been ruled by superhero movies; a perfect role model character who is brave and strong and has everything they ever need. Legion is a perfect contradiction. David Haller, the lesser-known son of Charles Xavier, otherwise known as Professor X from X-Men, is the most powerful mutant to have ever existed and yet is constantly doubting himself, his mental health and the feeling of loneliness that never goes away. Legion can be a hard show to follow along with due to the mind-bending visuals and immersive storytelling. The idea being that you feel what David is feeling,  and neither he nor the audience know what is actually real. Due to his conceptions, his mental health and incredible powers, David shows how a superhero can be isolated, alone and relatable.\n\n### UNDER THE SKIN (15)\n\n“Shared suffering, she’d found, was no guarantee of intimacy.”\n\nUnder the Skin is another unique and visually stunning movie in which Scarlett Johansson plays a character only ever referred to as ‘The Woman’. Without going into spoiler territory, the plot follows The Woman as she preys on lonely men, whilst also discovering things about herself and realising she is also deeply alone. It is hard to expand on the overbearing presence of loneliness and the connotations in the movie without spoiling it, however it is clear that everything in the movie is a visual metaphor of the feeling!.\n\n### HOUSE M.D. (15)\n\n“Everybody lies.”\n\nHouse M.D. is a medical drama show which features a main character who is speculated to have an antisocial disorder. Doctor House, played by Hugh Laurie, is a spectacular character study that makes you both relate to, and hate him at the same time. His antisocial behaviour is problematic in the show, however one very obvious fact about House is that he is extremely alone. He may be surrounded by his team and patients, but he doesn’t have friends or anybody who understands him and his techniques.\n\nThe next time you feel alone, try watching one of these to help you see that you are not the only one struggling and there are people there for you who will understand! One of our greatest faults is what we don’t share and reach out for help when we need it and one of our greatest strengths is realising that millions of other people are feeling the same. It only takes one person to reach out and help.\n\nIf you are battling with loneliness, we recommend you seek support from Mind, Childline or &amp; The Mix.\n\n### SHARE\n\n## Related content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Life Lessons From The Bard\n\nWriters’ Club member Elise shares what she’s learnt from Shakespeare and why she loves him…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### A Letter to My Future Self: Molly\n\nA manifesto for the future…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Footer left\n\n- Privacy Policy\n- Accessibility\n- Publication scheme\n- Modern Slavery Statement\n- Ethical Donations And Partnerships Statement\n\n## Footer right\n\n- Reports &amp;amp; Accounts\n- Terms &amp;amp; Conditions\n- Confidential Concerns\n- Safeguarding Policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCopyright © 2025 NCS\n\nNational Citizen Service Trust is a not-for-profit organisation incorporated by Royal Charter and established to shape, support, champion and lead a thriving National Citizen Service.

Loneliness and Isolation\n\nDespite being surrounded by the bustling city of Tokyo, both Bob and Charlotte feel profoundly alone and disconnected from their surroundings and loved ones.

This visual metaphor highlights her feelings of insignificance and detachment.\n- Lighting: The use of natural light coming through the window creates a stark contrast between the bright, busy city outside and the dim, quiet interior of her room, emphasizing her emotional isolation.\n- Sound: The ambient noise of the city contrasts sharply with the silence of her room, reinforcing the sense of her separation from the bustling world outside.\n\n#### 2.

It emphasizes Bob’s feeling of being emotionally disconnected and lost.\n- Sound: The dialogue is sparse and awkward, with long pauses that highlight the lack of communication and emotional connection. The ambient noise of the city in the background contrasts with the silence on the phone, emphasizing Bob's isolation.\n\n###\n\n#### 3. Cultural Dislocation\n\nThe film portrays the cultural dissonance experienced by the protagonists. The language barrier and cultural differences highlight their sense of alienation. Scenes depicting Bob's interactions with the Japanese media and Charlotte's explorations of Tokyo emphasize the stark contrast between their inner lives and the external environment.\n\nSource: Shotdeck\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExample: Bob's Whiskey Commercial Shoot\n\nScene Description: Bob's experiences during the commercial shoot for Suntory whiskey are a clear illustration of cultural dislocation.\n\nCinematic Techniques:\n\n- Editing: The use of jump cuts during the commercial shoot showcases Bob’s confusion and frustration.

The confusion in communication emphasizes Bob's alienation.\n- Performance: Bill Murray’s expressions of bewilderment and exasperation capture the cultural clash, making the audience feel his dislocation and estrangement.\n\n#### 4. Connection and Understanding\n\nDespite their loneliness, Bob and Charlotte find a deep connection with each other. Their relationship is platonic but profoundly intimate, offering them a sense of understanding and companionship that they lack in their respective lives. This bond is central to the narrative and provides a glimmer of hope in their otherwise disconnected existence.\n\nSource: https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/forget-the-whisper-lost-in-translation-karaoke-scene/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExample: Karaoke Night\n\nScene Description: One of the most memorable scenes showing the connection between Bob and Charlotte is the karaoke night, where they sing and spend a joyous evening together.\n\nCinematic Techniques:\n\n- Lighting: The vibrant, colorful lighting of the karaoke room contrasts with the muted tones seen elsewhere in the film. This change in lighting reflects the warmth and connection they feel in each other’s company.\n- Sound: The music in this scene, including Bob’s rendition of \"More Than This\" by Roxy Music, plays a crucial role. The lyrics and the heartfelt delivery of the song underscore the emotional bond forming between them.\n- Framing: The camera captures intimate close-ups of Bob and Charlotte, highlighting their expressions of genuine happiness and connection.

City Noise\n\n- Description: The sound design of the film incorporates the ambient noises of Tokyo—traffic, chatter, electronic beeps, and other urban sounds.\n- Effect:\n- Disconnection from Surroundings: These city noises highlight the protagonists' alienation and disconnection from their surroundings. The constant hum of the city contrasts sharply with their internal solitude, emphasizing their feelings of isolation amidst the bustling environment.\n- Cultural Dislocation: The unfamiliar sounds of a foreign city accentuate Bob and Charlotte’s sense of cultural dislocation. The cacophony of Tokyo’s streets underscores their status as outsiders trying to navigate an unfamiliar culture.\n- Specific Scene: When Charlotte wanders through the busy streets of Shibuya, the sound of traffic and bustling crowds emphasizes her sense of being overwhelmed and lost in the crowd.

These quiet moments allow the audience to focus on the characters' expressions and body language, adding depth to their internal struggles.\n- Emotional Weight: The absence of sound amplifies the emotional resonance of key scenes. For instance, when Charlotte sits alone in her hotel room, the silence underscores her loneliness and contemplation.\n- Specific Scene: In the scene where Charlotte visits the temple, the silence is punctuated only by natural sounds like the rustling of leaves and distant temple bells.

Editing and Pacing in Lost in Translation 2003\n\n#####\n\nLingering Shots: The editing style includes lingering shots that allow scenes to breathe, giving viewers time to absorb the emotions and atmosphere. This deliberate pacing aligns with the film's contemplative nature of the film. For example:  Charlotte, feeling disconnected and searching for meaning, visits a traditional Japanese temple. She is alone, dressed simply, and the atmosphere is serene and quiet.\n\nSource: https://black-harpoon.medium.com/lost-in-translation-filming-locations-joganji-temple-in-tokyos-nakano-ward-e615b96bc686\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShots:\n\n- Entrance to the Temple: The camera lingers on Charlotte as she walks through the temple gates. The shot holds for several seconds, capturing her slow, deliberate steps and the tranquil surroundings. The sound of her footsteps on the stone path is prominent, emphasizing the stillness of the moment.\n- Exploring the Temple Grounds: As Charlotte explores the temple grounds, the camera lingers on various elements—an intricate garden, a stone lantern, and the gentle sway of trees in the breeze. Each shot is held for an extended period, allowing the audience to fully take in the serene beauty of the setting.\n- Contemplative Moment: Charlotte sits on a wooden bench overlooking a koi pond. The camera holds on her for a long moment as she gazes at the water. Her face reflects a mixture of contemplation and melancholy.

The shot remains steady, capturing her careful, almost reverent movements and the peaceful ambiance of the temple interior.\n\nEffect:\n\n- Emotional Resonance: The lingering shots allow the audience to connect deeply with Charlotte's inner state. The extended duration of each shot gives viewers time to absorb her emotions and the contemplative atmosphere, creating a sense of empathy and understanding.\n- Atmospheric Immersion: By holding shots for longer periods, the film immerses the audience in the tranquil environment of the temple. The slow pacing and serene visuals provide a contrast to the hectic, disorienting scenes in the city, highlighting Charlotte's search for peace and meaning.\n- Reflective Tone: These lingering shots contribute to the film's reflective tone, encouraging viewers to pause and contemplate alongside Charlotte. The deliberate pacing aligns with the overall contemplative nature of the film, emphasizing themes of introspection and existential searching.\n\nJump Cuts: Occasionally, jump cuts are used to convey the passage of time and the disjointed experience of the characters. These cuts can create a sense of disorientation, mirroring the characters' psychological states. e.g. The scene with Bob Harris sitting in a luxurious room, ready for his photoshoot for a Suntory whiskey commercial. The director, speaking through a translator, gives Bob elaborate and confusing instructions.\n\nThe scene features a series of quick, disjointed cuts showing Bob in various poses and expressions as he tries to follow the director’s increasingly perplexing directions. These jump cuts move rapidly between different stages of the photoshoot, highlighting the chaotic and fragmented nature of the experience.\n\nSource: https://wallpapers.com/bill-murray\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEffects of the Jump Cut:\n\n- Disorientation and Frustration: The rapid succession of jump cuts effectively conveys Bob’s growing frustration and sense of disorientation. The fragmented editing mirrors his internal confusion and the surreal nature of the experience.\n- Passage of Time: The use of jump cuts also suggests the passage of time within the photoshoot session, giving the audience a sense of how long and arduous the process feels for Bob without showing every moment in real-time.\n- Cultural Dislocation: This editing technique underscores the cultural dislocation Bob feels, as the chaotic and fast-paced nature of the photoshoot contrasts sharply with his more laid-back, methodical approach to work.\n\nPacing:\n\n- Deliberate Tempo: The film's pacing is deliberately slow, reflecting the languid, introspective journey of the characters. This slow tempo allows for a deeper exploration of their inner lives and the nuances of their evolving relationship.\n\nGo Back to Index\n\n### Symbolism and Visual Metaphors\n\n##### The Hotel as a Liminal Space\n\nThe Park Hyatt Tokyo hotel serves as the primary setting where Bob and Charlotte’s relationship develops.\n\nSource: Shotdeck\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Symbolism:\n- Transitional Environment: The hotel represents a liminal space, a place between their old lives and potential new beginnings.

She wore floral motifs or dresses with stripes, except in the parts where her husband was brought in scene without actually being brought in scene. Here, she wore zig zags and spiral prints, possibly representing the ups and downs and loopholes in their marriage.\nI couldn’t help but take note of a lamp against an old cemented wall. The lamp was just above the dull and dark staircase where they went to get food and was always shining whenever their paths crossed. For me, it symbolises a ray of hope and light for Su Li-zhen and Chow Mo-wan in their otherwise empty love lives.\nAlso, there were evident globes / world maps in their respective offices, which could signify the distance between the four lives.

They don’t long fancy potions of love, they crave company more than affection.\n\nI watched this Wong Kar-Wai direction around 2 to 3 weeks back and found myself thinking about the characters of the story. The movie is in two parts, talking about two different stories connected by the sky of Hong Kong. Both of them talk about a cop with a broken heart and a goal-oriented woman. The only thing common between them is their longing for company and affection. The world they all live in is full of loneliness. This is pretty much what I felt while watching the characters in the film. I could feel the void they had in their life evidently.\n\n“So I never turn my back on a chance to rub my elbows. “— Fallen Angels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe characters in Chungking Express wanted nothing more than the feeling of being with someone because feeling more than that could have felt like a luxury to them. A luxury they can’t afford.\n\nQuick Guide for those who haven’t watched \n1. Movie Name: Chungking Express\n2. Written and Directed: Wong Kar-Wai \n4. Cinematographer: Christopher Doyle &amp; Andrew Lau \n5. Characters: \n Blonde wig lady by Brigitte Lin \n Cop 223 by Takeshi Kaneshiro \n Faye by Faye Wong\n Cop 663 by Tony Leung\n\n(P.S: None of the characters in the film were ever called by their name except Faye, just code names/numbers. So we never got to know their names till the end.)\n\n## Character Set One: Cop 223 and the Blonde wig lady\n\nI liked how Cop 223 and Blonde wig lady shared a silent company of their own when encountered each other properly at the bar and the hotel room as well. Cop 223 never wanted anything more from her, he just didn’t want to be left alone behind collecting expired pineapple cans and asking people if they like pineapples in different languages. All he wanted was a phone call from someone without him calling them first and a simple (but genuine) birthday wish. No fancy words or attachment stages he wished for. No more searches for pineapple cans with expiry dates of May 1st. Just someone to share the silence with.\n\n“I will remember her for the rest of my life.” — Cop 223, Chungking Express.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhereas, the Blonde lady whose face we never got to see in till the end was trapped in her world so bad that she never found herself on the surface. That blonde wig and big sunglasses are an example of how she hid in a mask for no one to find her. On the morning of May 1st, she felt for the first time what it feels like to be with someone and not alone when Cop 223 takes off her heels and washes them for her after spending the night together in that hotel room where he didn’t leave her alone by watching old movies on T.V and ordering room service all night. For the first time, she felt warmth and she returned it back to him by wishing him a happy birthday.\n\n## Character Set Two: Cop 663 and Faye\n\nThese two wished for a company as well. Cop 663 wanted someone who could bring him back to reality, perhaps himself. He wanted someone who could help him see how things have been changing around him and his house. Whereas Faye wanted to be that person of a company for him but she understood it’s not easy as he is still processing a heartbreak which was very well known by many now. So, she kept him company by keeping his house clean where he could come every night to relax without worrying about the condition of his house.\n\n“I started talking to the beer bottles.” — Cop 663, Chungking Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCop 663 himself didn’t realize the look of the house until it got flooded with water one day. He then observed how things are changing around him including himself (physically) without worrying about the point of who changed it. This question never came once to his mind, all he was able to see was what was in front of him. This shows the kind of personality he owns, focusing on what's in front of him.\n\n“Looking out this window, I have only one person in my thoughts.” — Faye, Chungking Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFaye liked Cop 663 a lot but her dream a bit more. But she never made a choice between favoring one of them more. She was practical and went for her dream but I still think that’s better than leaving a sad note with his apartment keys in it (tho she really had the keys), instead, she left a message for him about her whereabouts via her cousin with a handmade boarding pass to California. This shows how he (cop 663) and her dream to fly to California are both equally dear to her. That's what Faye’s character is like. She is free and goes for what her heart says on to do. She chooses herself. She does leave for California but didn’t forget what she is leaving behind going for new choices, unlike the cop’s ex-girlfriend. This is why, Cop 663 welcomed her with happy eyes when Faye saw him at her cousin’s restaurant, renovating it. He instead tried liking himself more and learning more about Faye through the music taste she left behind for him (we all know how one can learn a lot bout a person from their playlist, right?).\n\n## Change Of Routine\n\nThe movie beautifully tells us about the routine patterns of our characters and how they break through them later. It shows how an end of a relationship also means the end of a routine, a unifying pattern for your day-to-day life. It also shows the greatest danger that exists to romance: Change.\n\n“People Change. A person may like pineapples today may like something else tomorrow.” — Blonde wig lady, Chungking Express.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI said beautifully because of the cinematography here. Every scene looks no less than a painting.\n\nLike when Cop 223 almost throws up a fit at the convenience store when they tell him that they don’t carry any more pineapple cans with the expiry date of 1st May. That’s when he makes his feelings explicit to the clerk: Saying that he IS the can. An expired good was tossed around so his ex could feast on something fresher. The same was for our Cop 663 when he expresses to the restaurant owner indirectly, blaming how his ex left him for someone else as she figured out that there could be choices in men as there were in the food. They were not able to get over this new change happening around them and wished to stay in their old routine to console themselves. Be it expired cans or black coffee, they both wished to be in this cycle of theirs even tho they are all alone.\n\n“As May 1st begins, I came to realize, in May’s eyes, I am no different from this can of pineapples.” — Cop 223, Chungking Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMakes us realize how much of those anxieties are mirrored the experience of the dating apps. The feeling that there’s always a fresher can of pineapples who’s just a swipe away and the worry that even if you build a genuine connection with, what’s to stop them from waking up one day and deciding that they have had enough of the chef’s salad.\n\nFor me, it was Faye and the Blonde wig lady who were more mysterious. In the first half, we never got to know the Blonde wig lady’s name or her emotions or anything about her in person except for her problems. We know she is having a life or death situation cause she lost a group of Indians who were smuggling the drugs for her. The moment she lost them, the same expiry date on a can became her ‘so-called’ expiry date too. Whereas for Faye, we see her making efforts throughout the second half of the film for the guy she cares for. Still, it’s more about finding the mystery to know more about Faye and her intentions behind doing all she did. Even her leaving for California all of a sudden too was a mystery. It took a while for me to understand her mind, her dreams, and her priority among them.\n\n“I wonder if he ever opened my letter.” — Faye, Chungking Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBut at the end of their stories, it’s the leading ladies who make a choice for themselves. A new cycle they now wish to live in and leaving behind the old one. For the Blonde wig lady, it was to get rid of her boss who was a ticking bomb for her. While for Faye, it was to reach for her dreams to go to the real California. Of course, they both had a chance to remain in their old same routine but they chose to break through it. It’s not easy but they did. And the change was not just limited to the ladies, they indirectly bought that fresh breeze of change in the cops' life as well. For Cop 223 it was for cherishing the present moments and breaking the cycle of waiting for someone who doesn’t exist anymore (in his world). For Cop 663 it was again to live in the moment and do what he wants. The change of profession, in way of thinking and the music taste. It must have been difficult for them to go through it first but accepting must have been much harder than one can imagine. Right?\n\n“The letter turned out to be a boarding pass, post-dated a year later. I couldn’t make out the destination.” Cop 663, Chungking Express\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is what I observed after watching this film, its stories, and its characters. Maybe, when I watch it again on a midsummer's day or on a late spring night or on a winter morning on my projector flashing its cinematic beauty on my lavender color wall, I guess I will see more to it than I mentioned in here. The visual beauty of it, I guess it will be more understandable to me than it is now…\n\nHope you had a nice time reading my thoughts on this iconic masterpiece.\n\nWong Kar Wai\n\nChungking Express\n\nCharacter\n\nChange\n\nLoneliness\n\n--\n\n--\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Written by Meghna Thanvi | Mili\n\nI make experimental films.

They don’t long for fancy potions of love; they crave company more than affection.</paragraph>\n        <paragraph>I watched this Wong Kar-Wai direction around 2 to 3 weeks back and found myself thinking about the characters of the story. The movie is in two parts, talking about two different stories connected by the sky of Hong Kong. Both of them talk about a cop with a broken heart and a goal-oriented woman. The only thing common between them is their longing for company and affection. The world they all live in is full of loneliness. This is pretty much what I felt while watching the characters in the film. I could feel the void they had in their life evidently.</paragraph>\n        <quote>“So I never turn my back on a chance to rub my elbows.” — Fallen Angels</quote>\n        <paragraph>The characters in Chungking Express wanted nothing more than the feeling of being with someone because feeling more than that could have felt like a luxury to them. A luxury they can’t afford.</paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>## Character Set One: Cop 223 and the Blonde wig lady</paragraph>\n        <paragraph>I liked how Cop 223 and Blonde wig lady shared a silent company of their own when encountered each other properly at the bar and the hotel room as well. Cop 223 never wanted anything more from her; he just didn’t want to be left alone behind collecting expired pineapple cans and asking people if they like pineapples in different languages. All he wanted was a phone call from someone without him calling them first and a simple (but genuine) birthday wish. No fancy words or attachment stages he wished for. No more searches for pineapple cans with expiry dates of May 1st. Just someone to share the silence with.</paragraph>\n        <quote>“I will remember her for the rest of my life.” — Cop 223, Chungking Express</quote>\n        <paragraph>Whereas, the Blonde lady whose face we never got to see until the end was trapped in her world so bad that she never found herself on the surface. That blonde wig and big sunglasses are an example of how she hid in a mask for no one to find her. On the morning of May 1st, she felt for the first time what it feels like to be with someone and not alone when Cop 223 takes off her heels and washes them for her after spending the night together in that hotel room where he didn’t leave her alone by watching old movies on T.V and ordering room service all night. For the first time, she felt warmth and she returned it back to him by wishing him a happy birthday.</paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>## Character Set Two: Cop 663 and Faye</paragraph>\n        <paragraph>These two wished for a company as well. Cop 663 wanted someone who could bring him back to reality, perhaps himself. He wanted someone who could help him see how things have been changing around him and his house. Whereas Faye wanted to be that person of a company for him but she understood it’s not easy as he is still processing a heartbreak which was very well known by many now. So, she kept him company by keeping his house clean where he could come every night to relax without worrying about the condition of his house.</paragraph>\n        <quote>“I started talking to the beer bottles.” — Cop 663, Chungking Express</quote>\n        <paragraph>Cop 663 himself didn’t realize the look of the house until it got flooded with water one day. He then observed how things are changing around him including himself (physically) without worrying about the point of who changed it. This question never came once to his mind; all he was able to see was what was in front of him. This shows the kind of personality he owns, focusing on what's in front of him.</paragraph>\n        <quote>“Looking out this window, I have only one person in my thoughts.” — Faye, Chungking Express</quote>\n        <paragraph>Faye liked Cop 663 a lot but her dream a bit more. But she never made a choice between favoring one of them more. She was practical and went for her dream but I still think that’s better than leaving a sad note with his apartment keys in it (though she really had the keys), instead, she left a message for him about her whereabouts via her cousin with a handmade boarding pass to California. This shows how he (Cop 663) and her dream to fly to California are both equally dear to her. That's what Faye’s character is like. She is free and goes for what her heart says to do.

To say where the script, performances, cinematography and direction begin or end in these works is especially impossible. They bleed into one another so inextricably, so amorphously, so completely. The are a single thing, transient, spacious, fluid. In the case of Millennium Mambo, I would extend that exceptional synergy to Yoshihiro Hanno’s score and James David Goldmark’s Art Direction. It seems like an obvious thing to say, that a film is the result of many efforts and disciplines, but sometimes they come together in a seamless way that you sense rather than notice. Millennium Mambo is one of those cases.\n\nMillennium Mambo, Shu Qi’s debut film with Hou, turns 20 years old this year of 2021. Looking back, as the film itself does, I take this opportunity to sift through the confused and meandering prose I once wrote about Millennium Mambo, teasing out what I think I meant at a time when Taiwan New Cinema I was cracking my head open to cinema’s purest potentiality. This piece will read as an untidy sequence of snippets, observations, theories and impressions that have only a vague or tenuous linearity. Some of these ideas may be reiterated, recapitulated throughout, but regardless they lead deeper into the fabric of this magnificent and pure work about a young woman looking deeply at herself, with fairness and forgiveness, sifting through the traumas and mundanities that have shaped her.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVicky (Qi) drinks, smokes, and dances. She passes the time in a kind of frenetic stagnancy. She ensconces in the neon pulsation of club after club, a desensitizing escape from the suffocation of her apartment and her psychologically abusive boyfriend. However the stimulus around her is like a miasma. The colors, lights, synth and pulse of her diversions become an extension of her confinement and an expression of the dissonance of her world.  Hou uses the all the sensual and structural elements of cinema to give both liminal and subliminal life to that dissonance, in what may be his most vital and intimate work.\n\nHer live-in boyfriend, Hao-hao (Chun-has Tuan) is a neurotic and jealous recluse, constantly suspecting Vicky of infidelity and invading her privacy to feed that insatiable possessiveness. Every time she returns home he strips her down and smells her body for the scents of other people, roots through her purse and wallet, and even calls the numbers of suspect receipts, searching for someone to blame for his profound dissatisfaction. Vicky endures this mistreatment, repeatedly breaking up with Hao-hao only to return, hypnotized by the pendulum of his insistence, pulled in by the vacuum of his constant implosion.\n\nThe second man in Vicky’s life is Jack (Jack Koa), a gangster, indeterminately older, who meets Vicky at Club Spin and goes from a peripheral presence to a best friend during the course of the year. He in some ways plays a paternal role in Vicky’s life during her detox from Hao-hao. Their relationship is chaste, and Jack emanates a sense of sincerity, dedication and caution. Ever the negotiator in his precarious line of work, Jack’s mind and intentions are both clear and veiled always. Careful with his words, he creates a safe space for Vicky and needs nothing from her in return.\n\nVicky, Hao-hao and Jack are the specific players at the of an immersive and oblique story that churns in a sensual medium of techno beats, black light, and human behavior. Though seeming to stand relatively still, Millenium Mambo actually moves at the speed of synapses as a story told in the theater of Vicky’s memory, as recalled from the year 2011. The nature of Vicky’s active recollection through voiceover narration channels a kind of wildly intimate post-modernism scarcely tapped in Hou’s career (save for Good Men, Good Women) because we are imbedded deep inside the act of remembrance, beyond mere flashback. Vicky speaks of herself in 3rd person, as if to say she is no longer that trapped soul which we observe, just as she observes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHou establishes Millenium Mambo’s subtler non-linearity with the opening two minute shot. A floating lens follows behind Vicky as she strolls, unfettered and buoyant, through an enclosed nocturnal skywalk, perhaps the freest she will ever appear in a film that is only periodically punctuated by her joy. Bright neon-blue light saturates the scene from overhead fixtures, and the narrow space takes on a kind of spinal affect, which plays well into the idea that we are riding the arc of her impulses. She looks at the city around her through the arched openings. She looks behind, at the viewer but also past them, to where she has come from. Eventually, the camera stalls and Vicky leaves us at the top of a flight of stairs as she continues onward. In this act of stopping, Hou intimates something important–that Vicki's world is not confined by the frame, nor by the duration of a scene, nor the parenthesis of the film itself in either direction. pressing onward in time but also reaching backward to a past we have yet to see for ourselves. This lends an additional layer of realism to the film. Hou uses the heretofore closed-text medium of a film to render an open-text–expanding our notions of film as spatially confined, to where cinema includes that which lies beyond the spatial border and depth of the frame and the temporal border of the duration.\n\nThe first image of Vicky and Hao-hao’s studio apartment is an out-of-focus panning shot of blurred colors and vague architecture. The camera racks slowly into focus as Vicky has arrived home from a night at the club. We do not see her enter, rather that she has just entered, establishing a sense of containment opposite the free floating opening shot and the effervescence of a night out. In this way, Vicky’s walk along that corridor could read like a penetration into the well of memories. Seen this way, it is nearly as suggestive as the opening shot of David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive (2002) in which the camera describes a first-person view of someone crawling into bed, easing into their pillow and literally falling asleep into a dream which structurally predominates the film’s brooding length.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPar for the course with Hou Hsiao-hsien’s cinema, Millenium Mambo makes judicious use of cuts. Each scene derives its energy, tension, appeal and substance from a language of elliptically photographed banalities; hanging around in clubs, domestic quarreling, cleaning up an apartment, smoking, making drinks, cooking. Hou's films carry the natural pulse and texture of their time and place, and he makes it clear in his aptitude for the peripheral world, that that pulse extends (and draws from) sources beyond the confines of the narrative. Where the discursive and causal nature of most cinema is in a sense delimiting by virtue of its accrual of hard “facts” that actually reduce our imagination, Hou’s cinema is one of great volume and patience. It respires.\n\nFor characters like Vicky and Hao Hao who are lured and lulled by the literal pulse of club music, they are completely out of sync with the pulse within their own lives and their relationship to the world. They build conflict and suspicion upon vice and aimlessness. Mark Ping-bing Lee is able to capture that feeling of emotional / biorhythmic divorce with a lingering yet drifting camera that plays with depth of field.\n\nThe perspectival framework of Vicky–audience to her own history in 3rd person - forgives one recollection in which she is asleep at Jack’s apartment, during which we watch him returning late from a “meeting,” picks up her littered items in the hallway, suspiciously inspects his apartment, drapes a blanket over Vicky, smokes a cigarette, places his gun on the coffee table, and contemplates his predicament. Though she is unconscious as this event unfolds, Vicky defaults to a kind of surrogate authority in the security camera. Lee's lens first trains on the hallway security monitor. Jack approaches, sees Vicky’s purse on the floor, and notes with caution that the door is open. The camera pans away from the monitor and into the room as Jack enters with an unbroken continuity of action and non-dualistic space. This is the third time this exact shot has been used, with prior instances of Vicky entering Jack’s place. The security camera connotes Vicky’s entire process of self-watching that constitutes the film itself; a person looking through a camera, looking through the eye of another camera.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFuture Vicky’s recollections of her past are imbued, not with regret or judgment, but with deconstruction. She describes situations from her past before they happen on-screen; a gentle blindside to the audience as she virtually directs her own thoughts. Her preemptions of events through narration also indicate that she suspects where her train of thought is going to lead whilst also allowing the thoughts to sprawl.\n\nThis play with asynchronous flashback may have its seed in Hou’s more autobiographical film The Boys from Fengkuei (1982), when adolescent Ah-ching recounts a childhood memory of his father killing a snake with a baseball bat to friends, and shortly after, injected into a different scene, the memory is shown to us visually as memory in over-exposed faded sepia. Fengkueitherefore contains an impetus of what would flourish into its own entire mode in Mambo. The “precognitive” instance in Fengkuei differs only in that it is passive, where in Mambo it is active. Vicky gently constructs and critiques her memory as a structural function of the narrative, and Ah-ching simply experiences passing remembrances in thoughtful dazes. Both films allow the viewer into the heart of the act of remembrance though–Fengkuei as a tendency, Mambo as a rule.\n\nMillenium Mambo abounds with simple photographic technique that has psychological and sensual impact; shots of close-up color fields, blurred focus, tight compositions, images of textured glass, techno music that bleeds across scenes, visual superimpositions (the color fields and blinking lights over Vicky’s face in the love scene between her and Hao-hao, which evokes similar moments from Keislowski’s The Double Life of Veronique), physical obstructions such as characters blocking one another or structures in extreme foreground set against focused backgrounds, cigarette smoke, images captured in mirrors, the bedroom threshold in the studio apartment obscured by beaded curtains, frames within frames formed by doors and thresholds that shunt compositions and characters off to extreme or minimal portions of the screen (which calls to mind Motokichi Hasegawa‘s work in Yoshida Kiju’s Eros Plus Massacre [1969]). Examples of the latter include scenes in Jack’s apartment; one is a medium-long shot of him cooking at a stove backlit by the pale blue light of a curtained window picture left. The kitchen is next to another room shown only as a sliver on picture right. These two sections of cool toned background space are divided by a blank section of wall. The faintly warm light on the wall panel implies the whole unviewed room from which the viewer’s vantage orients. Vicky enters the kitchen and cuts the visual and chromatic space with her red hoodie as she challenges a slender depth of field. The camera plays long this gradient as she goes back and forth into the room for odds and ends like chili sauce. This scene is ostensible domesticity, but it is in fact a kind of nurturing normalcy that has been absent from her life.\n\nHou maximizes a sense of confinement throughout Millenium Mambo both in choice of environments; a cramped studio apartment, bustling nightclubs, and the way in which those environs are shot. While maintaining relatively tight framings (ranging from close to medium shots as dictated by the characters’ movements within a space rather than the camera issuing the dictation) with narrow depth of field, the camera moves in unbroken floating movements and slow zoom ins/outs from fixed orientations. Rather than use tracking/dolly shots, Hou specifically underscores the limited mobility of the characters literally, and figuratively the limitations of memory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA word on German artist Uta Barth’s photography and Ping Bin Lee’s cinematography. Their mutual proclivity towards blurred compositions (or compositional elements) and banal subjects (urban and domestic environs), or rather that subtler transient subjects/objects are inferred through technique, is the crux of their kinship. “The works that brought Barth to international attention, the series Ground and Field, presented photographic blurs caused by focusing the camera on an unoccupied foreground; these lushly colored images test connections between the descriptive clarity of photography and the haze of memory.” (Art Institute of Chicago)  Lee and Barth posit that a subject/object may be rendered by inference or impression , rather than by exposition. The subject before Lee’s lens is that of Vicky’s flow of memories, where the intangible medium of her humanity and cognition hold the “unoccupied foreground” and Lee negotiates her’s/our proximity to the events.\n\nHou asserts that negation is often a means to assert. In his constriction of visual space and depth, Hou amplifies our perceptivity of dimensional space and posits that other aspects of space, and indeed time, are being explored. Lee’s focus racks are slow, but in that process of graduating focal depth to follow characters movements, the full dimension of rooms are actually explored, one finite plane after the other, akin to a kind of scanning via depth-of-field. Sometimes we pan across great swaths of color and texture in blurred closeup until we finally reach an object in focus, other times still, a character will move in space and the depth of field slowly catches up to them rather than keep pace constant pace. All of these visual inflections are expressions of space, time, proximity, memory and even mood. So much is being communicated sensuously, information that goes beyond mere presentation. This is perhaps the difference between aesthetic and art.\n\nRaising comparison between cinema and photography elicits a basic concern. By nature photography is static and cinematography is kinetic. However photography demonstratively contains temporality, evident especially large format and long-exposure methods. Photographs describe parenthetical time. Cinema, though it unfolds with time, is itself a composition of many single photographs. One might consider the works of Photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, who in his series THEATERS knits these two modes of temporality together (which connote memory almost explicitly). Sugimoto produced a number of long exposure images taken of movie screens for the duration of entire films. The result is several pristine glowing white movie screens, which are the blinding accumulations of light from each films projection. The theaters themselves, which for someone inside them at the time would have been dark and indistinct, are revealed in crisp detail by virtue of an equation of time and light. Here too the subject is implicit and transient, a distortion by virtue of technique. Entire films, sequences of thousands and thousands of still images, are captured in one single image, yet in the completeness and absoluteness of singularity the specificity of each is negated.  The screens appear as radiant portals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe final shot of Millenium Mambo, during Vicky’s Japan odyssey after Jack’s disappearance, is the deepest and widest composition in the entire film; a strikingly empty, nocturnal, snow-covered street; “Yubari’s Road of Cinema,” where a number of crows are seen fluttering about. Over top of this image, Vicky narrates. We arrive at this moment after a montage of old film billboards; Tora-san, Alain Delon, and Zatoichi, bringing temporality, photography, cinema, memory, and space to consolidation. While Hou reminds us that what we have just seen is a film – and for Vicky as well taking the 3rd person perspective of a viewer - he more pointedly suggests that memory (through the filter of our peculiarities of direction, design and temperament) is cinematic, and cinema (by its innately documentarian nature) is memorial. Implicit also is a correlation between memory and space, where the vintage billboards of films line the upper tiers of an open street.\n\nDrawing everything that one can from what Hou selects to be shown, there is wonderful significance his choice of Zatoichi, a blind swordsman with an indistinct past who’s senses and spatial awareness are attuned around his disability, and Tora-San, an iconic drifter who drinks too much, repeats deplorable behaviors, and constantly returns to his home, both of whom bear much in their analogy to Vicky.\n\nMillenium Mambo is available to rent on Youtube, Amazon and iTunes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Newer\n- Older\n\nA WoTF Production\nPowered by teamwork.

The subject before <strong>Lee</strong>’s lens is that of Vicky’s flow of memories, where the intangible medium of her humanity and cognition hold the “unoccupied foreground” and <strong>Lee</strong> negotiates her’s/our proximity to the events.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            <strong>Hou</strong> asserts that negation is often a means to assert. In his constriction of visual space and depth, <strong>Hou</strong> amplifies our perceptivity of dimensional space and posits that other aspects of space, and indeed time, are being explored. <strong>Lee</strong>’s focus racks are slow, but in that process of graduating focal depth to follow characters movements, the full dimension of rooms are actually explored, one finite plane after the other, akin to a kind of scanning via depth-of-field. Sometimes we pan across great swaths of color and texture in blurred closeup until we finally reach an object in focus, other times still, a character will move in space and the depth of field slowly catches up to them rather than keep pace constant pace. All of these visual inflections are expressions of space, time, proximity, memory and even mood. So much is being communicated sensuously, information that goes beyond mere presentation. This is perhaps the difference between aesthetic and art.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Raising comparison between cinema and photography elicits a basic concern. By nature photography is static and cinematography is kinetic. However photography demonstratively contains temporality, evident especially large format and long-exposure methods. Photographs describe parenthetical time. Cinema, though it unfolds with time, is itself a composition of many single photographs. One might consider the works of Photographer <strong>Hiroshi Sugimoto</strong>, who in his series <strong>THEATERS</strong> knits these two modes of temporality together (which connote memory almost explicitly). <strong>Sugimoto</strong> produced a number of long exposure images taken of movie screens for the duration of entire films. The result is several pristine glowing white movie screens, which are the blinding accumulations of light from each film's projection. The theaters themselves, which for someone inside them at the time would have been dark and indistinct, are revealed in crisp detail by virtue of an equation of time and light. Here too the subject is implicit and transient, a distortion by virtue of technique. Entire films, sequences of thousands and thousands of still images, are captured in one single image, yet in the completeness and absoluteness of singularity the specificity of each is negated. The screens appear as radiant portals.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            The final shot of <Name>MILLENNIUM MAMBO</Name>, during Vicky’s Japan odyssey after Jack’s disappearance, is the deepest and widest composition in the entire film; a strikingly empty, nocturnal, snow-covered street; “Yubari’s Road of Cinema,” where a number of crows are seen fluttering about. Over top of this image, Vicky narrates. We arrive at this moment after a montage of old film billboards; <strong>Tora-san</strong>, <strong>Alain Delon</strong>, and <strong>Zatoichi</strong>, bringing temporality, photography, cinema, memory, and space to consolidation. While <strong>Hou</strong> reminds us that what we have just seen is a film – and for Vicky as well taking the 3rd person perspective of a viewer - he more pointedly suggests that memory (through the filter of our peculiarities of direction, design and temperament) is cinematic, and cinema (by its innately documentarian nature) is memorial. Implicit also is a correlation between memory and space, where the vintage billboards of films line the upper tiers of an open street.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            Drawing everything that one can from what <strong>Hou</strong> selects to be shown, there is wonderful significance in his choice of <strong>Zatoichi</strong>, a blind swordsman with an indistinct past who’s senses and spatial awareness are attuned around his disability, and <strong>Tora-San</strong>, an iconic drifter who drinks too much, repeats deplorable behaviors, and constantly returns to his home, both of whom bear much in their analogy to Vicky.\n        </paragraph>\n        \n        <paragraph>\n            <Name>MILLENNIUM MAMBO</Name> is available to rent on <strong>Youtube</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>iTunes</strong>.\n        </paragraph>\n    </content>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the key attributes from the ADT are clearly tagged.

The most acclaimed Russian filmmaker is a unique craftsman who conveys his thoughts in a surreal, philosophical, and poetic narratives. The Mirror premiered at Russia in the year 1975 is a meditative or ZEN-like screenplay that tears the very perception of CINEMA. I got severely affected by this MASTERPIECE. It feels like I’ve been to an unknown pilgrimage. The Mirror is a very personal film, I have learned that it was a semi-autobiography of Tarkovsky himself. The film conveys the parallel lives of a Father and Son, who are both the victims of lost-childhood. The film starred Margarita Terekhova and was co-written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky.\n\nThe Mirror is a reflection of thoughts, it doesn’t progress in the regular movie pattern. It is conveyed partly in a surreal tone, where the plot suddenly shifts to a dream sequence, and some characters suddenly appear from nowhere and disappear after their work is done. The film takes place in Soviet Russia after the revolution, where Alexei, the protagonist, is narrating his past while fighting an unknown deadly disease. His voice is frail and vulnerable, he was deeply affected by the divorce of his parents. His mother, Maria, with her two children (Alexei and his sister Marina), after the divorce, shifts from Moscow to a countryside village. They live in their grandfather’s isolated mansion. Fire erupts in their barn, where the agriculture or cattle is stored, Maria runs towards the fire and stops helplessly. The ongoing chaos interrupts Alexei, who was sleeping. He wakes and walks towards his mother. The narrative suddenly shifts to Alexei’s dream where he sees his mother Maria washing her hair contrary to the fire at their barn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe dream sequences take a paradigm shift indicating the distinct bitter quality of reality. The plot soon shifts to the present/reality. The real face of Alexei’s aged mother is revealed with a touch of cinematic genius.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlexei, who is reliving the past in his mind, imagines his mother with his wife’s face (Indicating their lives are more or less parallel).\n\nAlexei talks to his mother, who still resides in the countryside on the phone and shares his dreams, which are resuscitating his past. In their conversation, it is revealed that the time frame until then was the year 1935. The film continues to progress in the mind of Alexei, his face not revealed all through the film. The phone conversation continues as his mother shares the news of her colleague’s demise. Alexei’s life is dysfunctional as he divorced his wife, his distress is emphasized in the conversation with his mother. He questions his mother, Maria, that “Ma, why do we fight all the time? And Sorry, If I did something wrong”.\n\nThe plot again shifts to 1935, Maria runs to the printing house, where she works as a proof-reader. Maria is called Maroussia by her colleague in this episode, where she gets stressed for misplacing something important. She is verbally attacked or questioned by her colleague for her self-obsession and not feeling sorry about the divorce. Maria reaches into the bathroom. Now the plot again shifts to the present.\n\nAlexei, while having a conversation with his ex-wife Natalya (also played by Margarita Terekhova), confesses that she resembles his mother without revealing the dreams he is having and his fears about his kid Ignat. Alexei confesses to Natalya that he is often dreaming about his mother, but strangely his mother is seen with Natalya’s face. The director tries to justify the title over here. Their lives are MIRROR-IMAGES of each other. Both women share similar ideologies.\n\nWhile Alexei expressing his fear of Ignat speaking about Spain, Natalya and Ignat are invited by their Spanish neighbors who adore matador Palomo Lineras, a famous bullfighter from Spain, and they also watch the newsreel of Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The narrative becomes extremely absurd (It is a positive expression). Natalya leaves Ignat alone in the house and leaves for work. Two mysterious women appear suddenly and confront Ignat, the woman asks him to read the letter written by Alexander Pushkin to Chaadayev.\n\nThough it seems completely absurd, if watched closely, the letter consists of Russia’s evolution of isolating themselves from highly Church dominated Europe. We knew how things dramatically progressed within a century after the message. Throwing up Czar’s tyranny and the Red Army Choir, It is all the history.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the mysterious women disappear, Ignat receives a call from his father, Alexei, who remembers his rifle training. It is indicated that even Ignat underwent such training. The narrative shifts to the past, where Alexei is undergoing rifle training during the World War. The scene cuts to the extensive newsreel footage of the War (from Hitler’s death to the Hiroshima bombing). A shot is shown indicating the return of Alexei after the war and China-Russia border conflict kick starts immediately, the influence of Mao Zedong, the quarrel between two communist giants is shown with the stock footage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter world war II ends, the Sino-Russian border conflict begins in the film. The excellent stock footage consists of Mao’s unparalleled charisma in the hearts of the Chinese people.\n\nOnce the war ends, Alexei and his Marina say Adieu to their father as they are going to live with their mother. As an audience, I feel Alexei doesn’t want to leave his father. Now the plot shifts again to the present.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarkovsky changes the tone of the present, maybe to showcase the dark and flaccid life of Alexei. The present narrative becomes colorless until then; only some moments in the flashback were black and white.\n\nNatalya sees a picture of Alexei’s mother and says, We look alike, don’t we? To my surprise, Alexei replies No, Not at all. Natalya and Alexei get into an intense debate where Natalya says she is going to marry Dostoyevsky, a famous writer who is in exile (Not Dostoevsky). Alexei also admits the trauma he is going through because of the lovelessness in his life and the communist ordinances.\n\nAlexei’s embourgeoisement means – The proliferation in a society of values perceived as a characteristic of the middle class, especially of materialism.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThen the plot again shifts to the flashback where Alexei remembers his childhood (when he was 3 or 4) days he spent in his grandfather’s cottage. The timeline again changes suddenly to his adolescent days (maybe 10 or something) where Alexei and his mother Maria visits a doctor’s house. Maria says to the doctor that the purpose of her visit was ‘ladies little secret.’ After getting the medical help, Maria has a discussion with the doctor, during which the doctor asks Maria to slaughter a hen. Maria cuts off the cock’s head without having any hesitance. The narration becomes flamingly non-linear, It takes a minimum of five viewings to interpret what exactly the filmmaker wanted to communicate.\n\nTarkovsky breaks the most complex and logical barrier called ‘TIME.’ The next scene where 3-year-old Alexei walks up to his mother and says, “Mom, the kerosene stove is smoking.” His mother, Maria, looks completely old (60 something) doesn’t react and continues to smoke.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe plot now shifts to the alter-reality of Alexei, where the mysterious women appear again (who seemed to Ignat sometime before) and have a discussion with a doctor about the critical condition of Alexei. It is inferred that Alexei is suffering from a grave (but unknown) disease and do not have much time left.\n\nThe finale is the most brilliant sequence in the film. Tarkovsky, the filmmaker, tries to bring two different time phases into a single scene. The complete course is the combination of Alexei’s memories combined with his fantasies. He knows that she is dying, and all he could imagine is his relationship with his mother, Maria. In the scene, Young Maria (Mother of Alexei) is pleased with her husband. He asks Maria who is expecting,  would you like to have a boy child or a girl? And her reaction to that is unexplainable. She imagines the future where her two kids are following her.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince the sequence is taking place in the mind of Alexei, he still imagines his wife’s face while thinking about his mother in her young days. He believes her older look accurately, though. Actually, the scene is quite complex, I would try to explain it more straightforwardly. Pardon me if my observation seems simplistic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlexei, who is in his death bed, thinks of his beginning when he was in his mother’s womb, wholly protected. While he imagines that phase, his mother feels about his children. She fantasies that she would have two kids, and they remain as kids eternally. It is the most emotional moment I’ve ever witnessed in Cinema. It is a combination of brilliant craft and human emotions. I bow down to Sir Tarkovksy for this scene.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Mirror is an extremely personal film about memories, thoughts, and surrealism. It does not have a prefix beginning – conflict – end structure. It flows like thoughts, if we observe the mechanism of our thoughts, they seem irrational, unstable, and surreal at times. The Mirror is a personal trivia of an individual’s opinion about his mother, his own self, and his kid. The film is narrated in a very original format, a dream suddenly intercuts the reality and vanishes without any indication. In the narrative, Tarkovsky had used some poems written by his father. I personally loved the poem, which appears as the metaphor during the war showreels.\n\nI don’t believe forebodings, nor do omens\n\nFrighten me. I do not run from slander\n\nNor from poison. On earth, there is no death.\n\nAll are immortal. All is immortal. No need\n\nTo be afraid of death at seventeen\n\nNor yet at seventy.\n\nTowards the end, I would like to add that the photography and the music of the film are profound and pensive. I loved the performance of Margarita Tereshkova, she plays two characters in the movie, one is the mirror image of the other in different time frames. I would recommend this film to all the cinephiles who are yet to watch a life-defining cinema; to others, it will be a profound experience. It’s the purest form of ART, embrace it and progress.\n\nChaitanya.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Twitter\n- Facebook\n\n### Related\n\n## Post navigation\n\n## Blog Stats\n\n- 72,133 hits\n\n## Follow me on Twitter\n\n- Reblog\n- Subscribe Subscribed\n    - Cinema, Poetry and Stuff..\n    - Join 28 other subscribers\n    - Already have a WordPress.com account?
