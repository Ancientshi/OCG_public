    "profile": "**Personality Traits:**  \n1. **Emotionally Sensitive**  \n2. **Intellectually Curious**  \n3. **Preference for Depth Over Surface**  \n4. **Avoidant of Conventional Romance**  \n\n**Detailed Explanation:**  \n\n1. **Emotionally Sensitive:**  \n   The user expresses a fondness for \"tearjerkers\" and \"tragedy,\" as evidenced by their favorite movie, *Hotaru no haka* (Grave of the Fireflies). This film is renowned for its emotional weight and poignant storytelling, indicating that the user is likely in touch with their emotions and appreciates narratives that evoke strong feelings. Their enjoyment of films that make them cry suggests a level of emotional sensitivity and a willingness to engage with difficult themes, which can be indicative of a compassionate and empathetic personality.\n\n2. **Intellectually Curious:**  \n   The user's interest in thrillers with \"mind-bending stories,\" such as *Shutter Island*, points to a desire for intellectual engagement and complexity in the narratives they consume. This suggests that they enjoy puzzles and challenges, indicating a curious mind that seeks to understand deeper psychological themes and character motivations. Their preference for intricate plots may reflect a broader interest in exploring complex ideas and concepts, both in film and potentially in other areas of life.\n\n3. **Preference for Depth Over Surface:**  \n   The user’s avoidance of the romance genre further emphasizes their inclination towards narratives that offer depth and substance. Romance films often focus on surface-level emotions and relationships, while the user explicitly states a preference for stories that delve into psychological intricacies and emotional turmoil. This suggests that they value depth in storytelling and may prefer to engage with themes that provoke thought and reflection rather than those that are more straightforward or conventional.\n\n4. **Avoidant of Conventional Romance:**  \n   The explicit mention of avoiding romance genres indicates a clear preference for narratives that do not conform to typical romantic tropes. This could suggest a personality that is skeptical of idealized portrayals of love and relationships, possibly valuing authenticity and realism over fantasy. It may also reflect a desire to explore themes of human experience that are often overlooked in romantic narratives, such as loss, struggle, and resilience.\n\nIn summary, the user appears to be an emotionally sensitive individual with a strong intellectual curiosity, preferring complex and thought-provoking narratives over conventional romantic stories. Their cinematic preferences suggest a personality that values depth, authenticity, and emotional engagement in storytelling.",

Promise.\n\nHi there! You look a little overwhelmed, and I know just what you need: a good cry. It may sound counterproductive, but sometimes, putting on a sad movie and letting those tears flow is the only way out of a bad mood. Watching a tearjerker movie, letting out some emotion, and curling up under a weighted blanket isn’t just comforting, it’s a way to release all the difficult emotions you might be feeling. And it is glorious! (You know, after the sadness wears off.)\n\nCrying isn’t exactly an enjoyable experience for most. (No shade to those with a crying fetish, you do you!) But the lightness you feel after a good cry is truly unmatched, and the biggest shortcut to that feeling is watching one of these 60 best tearjerker movies. Trust, I have cried many tears over these sad films. And I always feel better and more in touch with my emotions after. That said, not every cry session needs to be on the same level. You might want to watch a movie that’s more hopeful than depressing or that’ll inspire versus destress. For this reason, I have taken the liberty to rank the best tearjerker movies of all time from good cry sad to absolutely emotionally devastating sad. You’ve been warned.\n\n## Little Miss Sunshine\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYes, we're kicking off the list with a movie called Little Miss Sunshine, and, yes, I mean it when I say it will make you cry. Two scenes in particular have left me a sobbing mess every. single. time: When Olive (Abigail Breslin) tearfully asks her grandfather if she’s pretty, and when Dwayne (Paul Dano) finds out he’s colorblind. Overall, this is a heartwarming movie about family and marching to the beat of your own drum, so it’s a great pick if you want to feel all the emotions in the span of 2 hours.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## Uptown Girls\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUptown Girls might be a coming-of-age comedy, but it’s physically impossible to watch Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning go round and round on the Coney Island teacups ride without shedding at least one tear. This is a scientific FACT about a beloved early 2000s chick flick classic, and you will never be able to tell me differently.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Beaches\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeaches gave us the iconic Bette Midler cover of “Wind Beneath My Wings.” Of course it’s a tearjerker. The ‘80s classic follows the years-long friendship of two women, C.C. (Midler) and Hillary (Barbara Hershey) as they see each other through career disappointments, failed marriages, and, eventually, the arrival of Hillary’s daughter. You can probably guess what happens next (hint: someone dies). You’ll end up sobbing, but also kind of hopeful.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## Under the Same Moon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWant to cry and have your faith in humanity slightly restored? Under the Same Moon gives you all the tear-jerking family drama without the despair. The movie tells the story of a little boy, Carlos, who crosses the Southern border into the U.S. to find his mother after his grandmother dies.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## The Banshees of Inisherin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin is a dark dramedy about two lifelong best friends whose abrupt breakup sends their small coastal town into chaos. Brendan Gleeson stars as Colm, a man who wakes up one day and suddenly decides he cannot stand his best friend, Pádraic (Colin Farrell), who won’t let go that easily. Despite being about the end of a friendship, it’s not necessarily a sad movie, but there are some pretty heartbreaking moments. No spoilers, but, yes, it does have to do with that much-memed Barry Keoghan scene.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n## Beasts of the Southern Wild\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere is a reason that Quvenzhané Wallis became the youngest actor ever nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars for her performance as Hushpuppy in Beasts of the Southern Wild. And that reason will leave you sobbing for a good 30 minutes. The film is an intense drama about a small Louisiana bayou community that is overcome by a dangerous storm, and uses magical realism and adventure to tackle themes of family, climate change, and belonging.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Minari\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt’s impossible not to be moved by Minari’s heartbreaking depiction of one Korean American family’s struggle to make the American dream a reality. The film centers on the strained marriage of Jacob (Steven Yeun), a dreamer determined to make this farm work despite his lack of knowledge, and his wife Monica (Han Ye-ri), who feels that her husband cares more about the farm than their family. There are so many quietly beautiful moments, but the real tear-jerking scenes come courtesy of David (Alan Kim), their little boy, and Soonja (the Oscar-winning Youn Yuh-jung), Monica’s mother, who travels from South Korea to help look after the children. I won’t spoil it, but you should have tissues on hand!\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n## Lady Bird\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is my go-to movie when I need a good cry. Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) navigates her senior year of high school in Sacramento, California as she falls in love, applies to college, worries about her family's finances, and manages a complicated relationship with her mother (Laurie Metcalf). Most of it actually isn't sad, but the final scenes where her mom turns the car around at the airport to try and run to her, and then Lady Bird leaves a voicemail about driving in Sacramento for the first time? My HEART.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Never Let Me Go\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWatching Never Let Me Go feels a bit like having an existential crisis. The movie, based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is about a group of three lifelong friends—Kathy (Carey Mulligan), Ruth (Keira Knightley), and Tommy (Andrew Garfield)—who were specifically made to be organ donors. But when they hear that there might be one way to escape their fate, their friendship will change forever.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResisting the obvious Steven Spielberg film here (that'd be Schindler's List) this one is, IMO, just as emotionally devastating, thanks to its themes of 1) parental abandonment, 2) divorce, 3) death(!), and 4) having to say goodbye to someone you love most in the world. NBD.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Fences\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf you can make it through Viola Davis’ heartbreaking monologue in Fences without crying, you would be the first. The actor’s Oscar-winning performance is so moving, you can’t help but burst into tears.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## The Notebook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPersonally, I've always found The Notebook to be a generally happy movie. Yes, there are bittersweet moments, like when Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) must leave each other after a summer of bliss, or when they later die together after a life well lived, but... OK, I lied, it's a tearjerker.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Toy Story 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI mean, I could absolutely put the first two movies on here. But the third dares to ask the unthinkable (the question we've been wondering since the first film): What happens when you finally get too old for your toys and have to say goodbye for the last time? You'll cry just thinking about it.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## A Little Princess\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis one goes out to all of the people who grew up terrified that they would be suddenly orphaned in a tragic accident and left to fend for themselves in a cruel world! A Little Princess brings that nightmare to life, telling the story of a little girl who becomes a servant maid after her father dies in WWI, leaving her all alone, penniless, and friendless.\n\nWatch Now\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen he learns that his ex has erased all memories of him (literally, like through a medical procedure), Joel decides to do the same thing. Then, once he's in the middle of it, he realizes what a terrible, terrible mistake he's made.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## Forrest Gump\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis movie brings a fair amount of laughs, but it has some seriously sad moments, too. When Bubba is killed in action? When Jenny breaks down in front of her childhood home? The ending scene??? *Sobs*\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## The Lion King\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTakin' it back with a classic: I promise you, *that* scene (you know, the one that made you sob uncontrollably in the movie theater with your parents?) is just as affecting as an adult. Who knew baby lions could be so damn emotional?\n\nWatch Now\n\n## Marley and Me\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf you've ever owned a dog, loved a dog, or even laid eyes on a dog, this tale of a mischievous golden retriever named Marley and how he teaches Jennifer Aniston, Owen Wilson, and their growing family to love will make you dampen a million Kleenex.\n\nWATCH NOW\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Little Women\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf Florence Pugh's signature frowny face doesn't make you emotional, I don't know what will. Little Women, as imagined by Greta Gerwig, has many tear-jerking moments, in part because it succeeds at making each of the March sisters (played by Pugh, Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen, and Saoirse Ronan) fully rounded characters you root for—even if it means another sister might suffer.\n\nWatch Now\n\n## Call Me by Your Name\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe can forgive Call Me By Your Name’s final shot of Timothée Chalamet silently crying into a fireplace because the movie is so full of gorgeous snaps of Italy. But like, when Timothée cries, we all cry, you know?\n\nWATCH NOW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Celebs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGabby Windey on Sexism and ‘The Traitors’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll the Deets on ‘Freakier Friday’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeets on Normani’s Engagement Ring, Right This Way\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKim’s Ex Only Paid for 1/5 of Her Engagement Ring\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAriana Was Always Going to Leave ‘Pump Rules’\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKelly Clarkson Is Coming Back to Her Talk Show\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJ.Lo Is Unbothered by Ben and Jen Reunion Rumors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIs ‘Adolescence’ a True Story?

But for catharsis and rejuvenation, you’ll have to reach for a sad movie (along with plenty of weapons-grade tissues). Here at Rotten Tomatoes we are trying to break your heart, and the fastest way we know to getting there isn’t with food or through the sternum, but with a thoughtful catalog of the truly tragic: the 100 saddest movies ever made.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur take on the essential and best sad movies doesn’t have a one-cry-fits-all approach. Instead, we split different tiers to flow your tears. We start with the emotional rescue from the likes of The Iron Giant and The Shawshank Redemption, to the water works guarantees offered by Titanic and The Notebook, and up to the five-alarm feeling destroyers of Fruitvale Station, Come and See, Grave of the Fireflies, and Dancer in the Dark.\n\nRead on, as Marya E. Gates takes you through the 100 saddest movies ever.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Photo by Focus Features/courtesy Everett Collection)\n\n# MOVIES THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL EMOTIONAL\n\nThe beauty of sad movies — or the desire to watch a sad movie — is that they can work on many levels. Some movies may not be earth-shatteringly sad, but they will touch in a deeply emotional way. For example, The Iron Giant touches on themes of loneliness and community and the idea that inherent goodness can win the day. If Beale Street Could Talk looks systematic racism right in the eye while also exploring the strength that can be found in family and love. While still as deeply weird as any film in his filmography, David Lynch’s The Elephant Man asks its viewers to set aside any preconceived notions they have about Joseph Merrick, whose facial deformities made him standout in Victorian-era England, and acknowledge our shared humanity.\n\nIn Killer of Sheep, director Charles Burnett explores the beauty, the joy, the desolation, and the resilience of an economically oppressed Black family living in Watts, Los Angeles during the recession of the 1970s through the powerful images and soul-stirring music. In Celine Song’s Past Lives, the writer-director uses the Korean concept of In-Yun to explore missed connections and the powerful mysteries of love in all its many forms. Captained by an iconic performance from star Robin Williams, Dead Poets Society is an ode to the power of teachers to guide their students towards a life led with intelligence and a sense of wonder. Carpe diem!\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck make an unexpected connection as a runaway princess and an ethically murky journalist who learn the true meaning of sacrifice for the greater good in classic romance Roman Holiday. Prickly family tensions and the steadfast power of love and partnership — as well as Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda’s captivating late-career performances — will tug at your heartstrings in On Golden Pond. Similarly, Lee Unkrich’s Coco explores changing family dynamics, forgiveness, and the power of shared memory across generations. Finally, the aging Umberto’s dedication to his dog Flike in Vittorio De Sica’s Umberto D. will touch the heart of even the biggest grinch.\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Affair to Remember\n(1957)\n\n\n 67%\n\n\n\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: There's not too much to it besides Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, but that's still enough to make this An Affair to Remember.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: A man and a woman have a romance while on a cruise from Europe to New York.

There have been many adaptations of Louisa May Alcott’s novel Little Women, but no scene packs the emotional wallop that Claire Danes brings to her monologue as Beth in Gillian Armstrong’s 1994 version. Similarly, there’s Gary Cooper’s Lou Gerhig addressing the stadium crowd in The Pride of the Yankees, declaring himself “the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.” Add in Heath Ledger’s Ennis as he breaks down holding his lover’s jacket at the end of Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain.\n\nAlthough much of Pig follows Nicolas Cage’s isolated truffle hunter and his violent attempts to get his animal back, the revelation of the heartache at the character’s core and the soulfulness Cage brings to his performance is unexpectedly touching. And try fighting back your tears when an uncontrollable blaze threatens to undo everything the Yi family has accomplished in Lee Isaac Chung’s semi-autobiographical Minari. Or when Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) must say goodbye to her mother in Sean Baker’s The Florida Project. Families being torn apart is also at the center of the classic 1937 weepy Stella Dallas, in which Barbara Stanwyck must make the ultimate sacrifice in order to ensure her daughter’s happiness.\n\n“We’ll always have Paris,” Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca and the hearts of movie-goers for decades have yet to recover. Thankfully, not all tearjerker endings leave on a sad note, as Charlie Chaplin and Virginia Cherrill show us in the silent romance City Lights.\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtonement\n(2007)\n\n\n 83%\n\n\n\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: Atonement features strong performances, brilliant cinematography, and a unique score.

Melodrama is a staple genre for this kind of cry, especially films about star-crossed lovers who just can’t seem to make it work, like Jack and Rose in James Cameron’s epic Titanic. Or Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai’s In The Mood For Love, whose love blossoms out of the destruction of each other’s marriages. The heartbreak at the center of Geneviève and Guy’s ill-fated young romance in Jacques Demy’s musical drama The Umbrellas of Cherbourg has not only elicited tears from audiences for generations, it served as the inspiration for the ending of Damien Chazelle’s La La Land.\n\nGoing even further back to the genre’s heyday is Now, Voyager, which features Bette Davis at her most emotive as a neglected socialite who finds her own strength after finally finding true love with a married man.\n\nThen there are movies like The Notebook which use melodrama to both explore the fraught beginnings of a passionate relationship, but also its bittersweet end. While most of Pixar’s Up is dedicated to widower Carl’s reluctant adventures with his neighbor Russell, the film’s most powerful moment is its opening sequence, which silently depicts Carl’s marriage with his wife Ellie from its inception until his death.\n\nFilms about mourning, like David Lowery’s A Ghost Story, tap into that universal feeling of loss that everyone must confront at some point in their life. Good cries can also come from bittersweet films, like Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore’s love letter to movies. Or 1939’s Goodbye, Mr. Chips, which follows the impact a teacher has on his students over a nearly-sixty year period. Lastly, there are movies like Hachi, which tackles both grief and the steadfast loyalty of a very good dog.\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAftersun\n(2022)\n\n\n 95%\n\n\n\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics

These include movies in which a character has to part with a beloved animal, like in Wendy and Lucy, where writer/director Kelly Reichardt uses the central human-canine relationship to explore systems of poverty in America. In The Yearling, youngster Jody’s beloved pet deer becomes a symbol of the growing pains that happen when you are asked to put away childish things.\n\nThis feeling can also be evoked by films about the passing of a lover, like in Longtime Companion. Abbie Cornish’s reaction after hearing about the death of her betrothed, Romantic poet John Keats, in Jane Campion’s Bright Star is so visceral you feel as pained as she does. In fact, most films that will make you ugly cry including the intense emotions of grieving a loved one, sometimes even before they have left, as in Shirley MacLaine’s show-stopping performance as a mother watching her grown child lose a battle with cancer in Terms of Endearment, or even young Jackie Cooper in 1931’s The Champ, whose tender relationship with his pugilist father played by Wallace Beery comes to a brutal end after one fateful boxing match.\n\nIn the classic melodrama Penny Serenade, Irene Dunne and Cary Grant play a married couple who suffer many losses as they attempt to build a family together. There are also films with a line of dialogue that act as the breaking point before the deluge of tears take over. There isn’t a person alive who can make it through My Girl when Vada (Anna Chlumsky) insists her friend Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) can’t see without his glasses. Or when good boy Charlie B. Barkin tells his friend Anne-Marie that goodbyes aren’t forever in All Dogs Go To Heaven. Or in Ghost when Sam tells his grieving girlfriend Molly that when you die you take all the love inside you into the afterlife. But some ugly cries come from sadness that is conquered, as in It’s A Wonderful Life where George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) overcomes his suicidal despair and realizes that no man is a failure who has friends.\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Dogs Go to Heaven\n(1989)\n\n\n 46%\n\n\n\n\n#1\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: No consensus yet.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: In this animated feature, canine casino owner Charlie (Burt Reynolds) is killed by gambler Carface (Vic Tayback), but returns to\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nDom DeLuise\n\t\t, \t\tBurt Reynolds\n\t\t, \t\tDaryl Gilley\n\t\t, \t\tCandy Devine\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nDon Bluth\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBambi\n(1942)\n\n\n 91%\n\n\n\n\n#2\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: Elegantly animated and deeply touching, Bambi is an enduring, endearing, and moving Disney classic.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: In a classic Disney animation, a fawn named Bambi joins his new friends, a young rabbit named Thumper and a\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nHardie Albright\n\t\t, \t\tStan Alexander\n\t\t, \t\tPeter Behn\n\t\t, \t\tTim Davis\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nDavid Hand\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBright Star\n(2009)\n\n\n 82%\n\n\n\n\n#3\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: Jane Campion's direction is as refined as her screenplay, and she gets the most out of her cast -- especially Abbie Cornish -- in this understated period drama.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: In 1818, high-spirited young Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) finds herself increasingly intrigued by the handsome but aloof poet John Keats\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nAbbie Cornish\n\t\t, \t\tBen Whishaw\n\t\t, \t\tPaul Schneider\n\t\t, \t\tKerry Fox\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nJane Campion\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Champ\n(1931)\n\n\n 96%\n\n\n\n\n#4\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: No consensus yet.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: Champ (Wallace Beery) is a down-on-his-luck boxer in Tijuana whose son, Dink (Jackie Cooper), adores him despite Champ's addictions to\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nWallace Beery\n\t\t, \t\tJackie Cooper\n\t\t, \t\tIrene Rich\n\t\t, \t\tRoscoe Ates\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nKing Vidor\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost\n(1990)\n\n\n 75%\n\n\n\n\n#5\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: Ghost offers viewers a poignant romance while blending elements of comedy, horror, and mystery, all adding up to one of the more enduringly watchable hits of its era.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is a banker, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) is an artist, and the two are madly in\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nPatrick Swayze\n\t\t, \t\tDemi Moore\n\t\t, \t\tWhoopi Goldberg\n\t\t, \t\tTony Goldwyn\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nJerry Zucker\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life\n(1946)\n\n\n 94%\n\n\n\n\n#6\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: The holiday classic to define all holiday classics, It's a Wonderful Life is one of a handful of films worth an annual viewing.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: After George Bailey (James Stewart) wishes he had never been born, an angel (Henry Travers) is sent to earth to\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nJames Stewart\n\t\t, \t\tDonna Reed\n\t\t, \t\tLionel Barrymore\n\t\t, \t\tThomas Mitchell\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nFrank Capra\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Joy Luck Club\n(1993)\n\n\n 86%\n\n\n\n\n#7\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: The Joy Luck Club traces the generational divide, unearthing universal truths while exploring lives through the lens of a specific cultural experience.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: In San Francisco, a group of aging Chinese women (Kiều Chinh, Tsai Chin, France Nuyen, Lisa Lu) meet regularly to\t\t\t\t\t\t [More]\n\n\n\n\t\tStarring:\t\nRosalind Chao\n\t\t, \t\tTamlyn Tomita\n\t\t, \t\tFrance Nuyen\n\t\t, \t\tVivian Wu\n\n\n\n\t\tDirected By:\t\nWayne Wang\n \n\n\n\n\n\n#8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongtime Companion\n(1990)\n\n\n 91%\n\n\n\n\n#8\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics Consensus: Longtime Companion is a sensitive ensemble AIDS drama, lensed with sympathy which builds to a moving finale.\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSynopsis: During the 1980s, a group of gay men and their straight female friend confront the spread of AIDS.

These are the movies that do not leave you with any sense of hope. They sit with you like a weight. They change your DNA completely. Often these films take you through the most extreme depths of the human experience.\n\nMade during the Great Depression, Leo McCarey’s Make Way For Tomorrow follows a long-married elderly couple who are forced to separate after they lose their home and none of their grown children will take them. The Studio Ghibli classic Grave of the Fireflies follows two war orphans as they struggle to stay alive in Kobe, Japan during the final weeks of World War II. Louis Malle’s Au Revoir Les Enfants was inspired by his own experience as a student in a boarding school run by Père Jacques, a French priest who attempted to shelter Jewish children during the Holocaust.\n\nShot on location in post-WWII Rome and starring non-professional actors, a father must find his stolen bicycle or he’ll lose his job and ability to feed his family in Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves. Inspired by a Leo Tolstoy novella, Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru features a soulful performance from his long-time collaborator Takashi Shimura as a terminally ill, widowed Tokyo bureaucrat who strives to leave a meaningful impact on the world before he passes. Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar follows a donkey who passes through many owners, all of whom treat the poor creature with nothing but various forms of callous cruelty. In Lynch’s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, trouble teenager Laura Palmer finds her life cut short after being used and abused by almost everyone in her life.\n\nAdapted from the 1972 novel by Richard Adams, Martin Rosen’s dystopic animated feature Watership Down uses a society made of rabbits as a way to explore the complexity of life in all its most troubling, violent, haunting, and even joyous ways. Similarly, Mark Romanek ‘s Never Let Me Go, adapted from a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, raises questions of ethics and explores the fragility of life via the coming-of-age of a trio of teenagers who discover the stark purpose of their lives. And in a world where climate change has caused rising sea levels that have wiped out 99% of existing cities, David, a prototype child-like toy, goes on a journey to find meaning and love after he’s abandoned by his family in Steven Spielberg’s existential masterwork A.I.

But for catharsis and rejuvenation, you’ll have to reach for a sad movie (along with plenty of weapons-grade tissues). Here at Rotten Tomatoes we are trying to break your heart, and the fastest way we know to getting there isn’t with food or through the sternum, but with a thoughtful catalog of the truly tragic: the 100 saddest movies ever made.\n\nOur take on the essential and best sad movies doesn’t have a one-cry-fits-all approach. Instead, we split different tiers to flow your tears. We start with the emotional rescue from the likes of <Name>The Iron Giant</Name> and <Name>The Shawshank Redemption</Name>, to the water works guarantees offered by <Name>Titanic</Name> and <Name>The Notebook</Name>, and up to the five-alarm feeling destroyers of <Name>Fruitvale Station</Name>, <Name>Come and See</Name>, <Name>Grave of the Fireflies</Name>, and <Name>Dancer in the Dark</Name>.\n\nRead on, as Marya E. Gates takes you through the 100 saddest movies ever.\n\n# MOVIES THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL EMOTIONAL\n\nThe beauty of sad movies — or the desire to watch a sad movie — is that they can work on many levels. Some movies may not be earth-shatteringly sad, but they will touch in a deeply emotional way. For example, <Name>The Iron Giant</Name> touches on <Themes>themes of loneliness and community</Themes> and the idea that inherent goodness can win the day. <Name>If Beale Street Could Talk</Name> looks systematic racism right in the eye while also exploring the <Themes>strength that can be found in family and love</Themes>. While still as deeply weird as any film in his filmography, David Lynch’s <Name>The Elephant Man</Name> asks its viewers to set aside any preconceived notions they have about Joseph Merrick, whose facial deformities made him standout in Victorian-era England, and acknowledge our shared humanity.\n\nIn <Name>Killer of Sheep</Name>, director <Director>Charles Burnett</Director> explores the beauty, the joy, the desolation, and the resilience of an economically oppressed Black family living in Watts, Los Angeles during the recession of the 1970s through the powerful images and soul-stirring music. In <Name>Past Lives</Name>, the writer-director <Director>Celine Song</Director> uses the Korean concept of In-Yun to explore missed connections and the powerful mysteries of love in all its many forms. Captained by an iconic performance from star <Name>Robin Williams</Name>, <Name>Dead Poets Society</Name> is an ode to the power of teachers to guide their students towards a life led with intelligence and a sense of wonder. Carpe diem!\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck make an unexpected connection as a runaway princess and an ethically murky journalist who learn the true meaning of sacrifice for the greater good in classic romance <Name>Roman Holiday</Name>. Prickly family tensions and the steadfast power of love and partnership — as well as <Name>Katharine Hepburn</Name> and <Name>Henry Fonda</Name>’s captivating late-career performances — will tug at your heartstrings in <Name>On Golden Pond</Name>. Similarly, <Director>Lee Unkrich</Director>’s <Name>Coco</Name> explores changing family dynamics, forgiveness, and the power of shared memory across generations. Finally, the aging Umberto’s dedication to his dog Flike in <Name>Umberto D</Name> will touch the heart of even the biggest grinch.\n\n#1\n\n<Name>An Affair to Remember</Name> (1957)\n\n67%\n\nCritics Consensus: There's not too much to it besides <Name>Cary Grant</Name> and <Name>Deborah Kerr</Name>, but that's still enough to make this <Name>An Affair to Remember</Name>.\n\nSynopsis: A man and a woman have a romance while on a cruise from Europe to New York.

Feature Animation and directed by Brad Bird in his directorial debut. It is loosely based on the 1968 novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes (which was published in the United States as The Iron Giant), and was written by Tim McCanlies from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and M. Emmet Walsh. Set during the Cold War in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of the Who's Pete Townshend, though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using traditional animation, with computer-generated imagery used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. Michael Kamen composed the film's score, which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic. It was the final film by Warner Bros. Feature Animation to be fully animated and not a live-action/animation hybrid.\n\nThe Iron Giant premiered at Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6. The film significantly underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was attributed to Warner Bros.' lack of marketing and skepticism towards animated film production following the box office failure of Quest for Camelot in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, musical score, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick, Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal, and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following[7] and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic, and one of the greatest animated films ever made.[8][9][10] In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically,[8][11] and on home video the following year.[12][13]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn October 1957, during the Cold War, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, young Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a gigantic alien robot; he flees, but returns to save the giant from being electrocuted when the giant attempts to eat a substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When the Giant eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, discovering that he can self-repair. Hogarth shows the Giant his comic books, and compares him to the hero Superman.\n\nThe incidents lead paranoid U.S. government agent Kent Mansley to Rockwell. Deducing Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother, Annie, Mansley rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys spending time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after they witness hunters killing a deer.\n\nMansley interrogates and detains Hogarth after discovering a photograph of Hogarth and the Giant together, then sends U.S. Army General Shannon Rogard and a platoon of soldiers to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence. Dean, having been forewarned by Hogarth, disguises the Giant as one of his art pieces, tricking the soldiers into leaving. While playing with a toy gun, Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system, which fires a laser. Dean yells at the Giant for nearly killing Hogarth, and the horrified Giant flees into downtown Rockwell, with Hogarth in pursuit. Dean discovers that the Giant was only acting in self-defense, and pursues them both.\n\nThe Giant rescues two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant, and Rogard orders his men to attack the robot, not realizing he is holding Hogarth. The Giant uses his flight system to evade the military at first, but is shot down and crash-lands.\n\nHogarth is rendered unconscious, but the Giant assumes that Hogarth is dead. The soldiers open fire, causing the Giant's defense systems to activate and begin attacking the army. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus, as conventional weapons seem to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and hastily calms down the Giant, while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard.\n\nRogard is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to deactivate its primed missile, but a panicked Mansley snatches Rogard's radio and orders the launch. Rogard reveals that, as the Giant has returned to Rockwell, the missile (which is targeted to him) will also destroy the town upon detonation. Mansley tries escaping, but the Giant thwarts him, and Rogard has Mansley arrested. To save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. Soaring into the missile's path, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words, \"You are who you choose to be,\" smiles contentedly, and declares himself \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the outer atmosphere, saving the soldiers and civilians in Rockwell. However, the Giant is presumably destroyed, devastating Hogarth, Dean, Annie, and Rogard.\n\nMonths later, Dean and Annie, now a couple, admire a memorial statue of the Giant that Dean has erected in the local park. Rogard gives Hogarth a package containing a screw from the Giant, which was the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland, and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n## Voice cast\n\nChristopher McDonald, Brad Bird and Eli Marienthal in March 2012 at the Iron Giant screening at the LA Animation Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, an intelligent, curious, energetic, and courageous 9-year-old boy with an active imagination. Marienthal's performances were videotaped and given to animators to work with, which helped develop expressions and acting for the character.[14] He is named after author Ted Hughes, who wrote the book that inspired the film, and artist Burne Hogarth.\n- Jennifer Aniston as Annie Hughes, Hogarth's mother, the widow of a military pilot, and a diner waitress. According to Bird, Aniston was the only casting suggestion made by Warner Bros. execs that he personally really liked and approved.[15]\n- Harry Connick Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik artist and junkyard owner. Bird felt it appropriate to make the character a member of the Beat Generation, as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.[16]\n- Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant, a 50 ft., metal-eating robot.[17] Of unknown origin and created for an unknown purpose, the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it. The Giant's voice was originally going to be electronically modulated but the filmmakers decided they \"needed a deep, resonant and expressive voice to start with\", so they hired Diesel.[18]\n- James Gammon as Foreman Marv Loach, a power station employee who follows the robot's trail after it destroys the station.\n    - Gammon also voices Floyd Turbeaux, a farmer and friend of Earl Stutz.\n- Cloris Leachman as Karen Tensedge, Hogarth's fourth grade teacher at Redford Elementary School.\n- Christopher McDonald as Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal government agent sent to investigate sightings of the Iron Giant. The logo on his official government car says he is from the \"Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena\".\n- John Mahoney as General Shannon Rogard,[17] an experienced and level-headed military leader in Washington, D.C., Mansley's superior at the Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena who goes from merely being annoyed and exasperated with Mansley to openly despising him.\n- M. Emmet Walsh as Earl Stutz, a sailor and the first man to see the Giant.\n\nIn addition, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas voice the train's engineers briefly seen near the start of the film. Johnston and Thomas, who were animators and members of Disney's Nine Old Men, were cited by Bird as inspirations for his career, which he honored by incorporating their voices, likenesses, and first names into the film.[16]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nThe origins of the film lie in the book The Iron Man (1968), by poet Ted Hughes, who wrote the novel for his children to comfort them in the wake of their mother Sylvia Plath's suicide. In the 1980s, rock musician Pete Townshend chose to adapt the book for a concept album; it was released as The Iron Man: A Musical in 1989.[18] In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film's lead animator, pitched a version of The Iron Man to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland. He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project.[14] After a stage musical was mounted in London, Des McAnuff, who had adapted Tommy with Townshend for the stage, believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment.[18]\n\nIn late 1996, while developing the project on its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird, who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation developing Ray Gunn.[18] Turner Broadcasting had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner, and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant.[18] After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros.[18] This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book, Dean and Kent, setting the film in America, and discarding Townshend's musical ambitions (who did not care either way, reportedly remarking, \"Well, whatever, I got paid\").[19][20] Bird would expand upon his desire to set the film in America in the 1950s in a later interview:\n\nThe Maine setting looks Norman Rockwell idyllic on the outside, but inside everything is just about to boil over; everyone was scared of the bomb, the Russians, Sputnik — even rock and roll. This clenched Ward Cleaver smile masking fear (which is really what the Kent character was all about). It was the perfect environment to drop a 50-foot-tall robot into.[20]\n\nTed Hughes, the original story's author, died before the film's release. His daughter, Frieda Hughes, saw the finished film on his behalf and loved it. Townshend, who stayed on as the film's executive producer, enjoyed the final film as well.[21]\n\n### Writing\n\nTim McCanlies was hired to write the script, though Bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself.[19] He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions.[18] In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival, stating, \"You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back.\"[19] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. \"didn't have time to mess with us\" as McCanlies said.[22] The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth.[23] Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as \"paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling\".[20] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, \"I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He's made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He's made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he's developed The Iron Giant. I can't stop thinking about it.\"[18]\n\nBird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons as an example of working under strict deadlines.[20] He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly.[24] One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. \"There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's almost as if the audience has the remote and they're going to change channels,\" he commented at the time.[23] Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the \"hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.\" Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the \"Duck and Cover\" sequence came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film.[16] Nicknamed \"The X-Factor\" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script.[25]\n\n### Animation\n\nThe financial failure of Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, which made the studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giant's production considerably. \"Three-quarters\" of the animation team on that film helped craft The Iron Giant.[23] By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"[23] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees\", said production designer Mark Whiting.[26]\n\nBird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed animatics, to make sure there were no budgetary concerns.[23] The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed \"Macro\" early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\"[27] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film.[14] Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.[20]\n\nHe opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created.[24][28] The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner\".[18] They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion.[24] The Giant consisted of 7000 parts (the Battle Giant had 10,000 parts),[29] and was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston and refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant.[23] Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model.[23] Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\"[24] Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including Alias Systems Corporation's Maya, Alias' PowerAnimator, a modified version of Pixar's RenderMan, Softimage 3D, Cambridge Animation's Animo (now part of Toon Boom Technologies), Avid Elastic Reality, and Adobe Photoshop.[30]\n\nThe art of Norman Rockwell, Edward Hopper and N.C. Wyeth inspired the design. Whiting strove for colors both evocative of the time period in which the film is set and also representative of its emotional tone; for example, Hogarth's room is designed to reflect his \"youth and sense of wonder\".[26] That was blended with a style reminiscent of 1950s illustration. Animators studied Chuck Jones, Hank Ketcham, Al Hirschfeld and Disney films from that era, such as 101 Dalmatians, for inspiration in the film's animation.[28]\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for the film was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, making it the only film directed by Bird not to be scored by his future collaborator, Michael Giacchino, as of December 2024. Bird's original temp score, \"a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from '50s and '60s sci-fi films,\" initially scared Kamen.[31] Believing the sound of the orchestra is important to the feeling of the film, Kamen \"decided to comb eastern Europe for an \"old-fashioned\" sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss's An Alpine Symphony.\" Eventually, the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film's score, with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as \"an amazing collection of musicians\".[32] The score for The Iron Giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner, compared to most films: recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague, the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music, in a method Kamen described in a 1999 interview as \"[being able to] play the music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire.\"[31] Kamen's score for The Iron Giant won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999.[33]\n\n### Post-production\n\nBird opted to produce The Iron Giant in widescreen—specifically the wide 2.39:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio—but was warned against doing so by his advisers. He felt it was appropriate to use the format, as many films from the late 1950s were produced in such widescreen formats.[34] He hoped to include the CinemaScope logo on a poster, partially as a joke, but 20th Century Fox, owner of the trademark, refused.[35]\n\nBird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop.[36] This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, \"If they were interested in telling the story, they should let it be what it wants to be.\"[23] The film was also initially going to be released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo which features mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo eating a carrot as seen in the film's teaser trailer. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, mainly because he felt that the logo did not fit the tone of the movie, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts.[36] He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion.[23]\n\nAccording to a report from the time of its release, The Iron Giant cost $50 million to produce with an additional $30 million going towards marketing,[6] though Box Office Mojo later reported its budget as $70 million.[37] It was regarded as a lower-budget film, in comparison to the films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.[38]\n\n## Themes\n\nWhen he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote The Iron Man as a means of comforting his children after his wife, Sylvia Plath, died by suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan.[39][40] McCanlies commented that \"at a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out for the rest of your life\", adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would \"make us feel like we're all part of humanity [which] is something we need to feel.\"[22] When some critics compared the film to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Bird responded by saying \"E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay. Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt.\"[34]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nWe had toy people and all of that kind of material ready to go, but all of that takes a year! Burger King and the like wanted to be involved. In April we showed them the movie, and we were on time. They said, \"You'll never be ready on time.\" No, we were ready on time. We showed it to them in April and they said, \"We'll put it out in a couple of months.\" That's a major studio, they have 30 movies a year, and they just throw them off the dock and see if they either sink or swim, because they've got the next one in right behind it. After they saw the reviews they [Warner Bros.] were a little shamefaced.\n\nThe Iron Giant was a commercial failure during its theatrical release; consensus among critics was that its failure was, in part, due to lack of promotion from Warner Bros. This was largely attributable to the reception of Quest for Camelot; after its release, Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April 1999.[41][42] After wildly successful test screenings, the studio was shocked by the response: the test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years, according to Bird.[20] They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film—such as cereal and fast food tie-ins—with little time left before its scheduled release. Bird remembered that the studio produced one teaser poster for the film, which became its eventual poster.[36] Brad Ball, who had been assigned the role of marketing the film, was candid after its release, noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan.[43] IGN stated that \"In a mis-marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros., they simply didn't realize what they had on their hands.\"[44]\n\nThe studio needed an $8 million opening to ensure success, but they were unable to properly promote it preceding the release. They nearly delayed the film by several months to better prepare. \"They said, 'we should delay it and properly lead up to its release,' and I said 'you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this,'\" recalled Bird.[36] Press outlets took note of its absence of marketing,[45] with some reporting that the studio had spent more money on marketing for the intended summer blockbuster Wild Wild West instead.[24][41] Warner Bros. scheduled Sunday sneak preview screenings for the film prior to its release,[46] as well as a preview of the film on the online platform Webcastsneak.[47]\n\n### Home media and television syndication\n\nAfter criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release, Warner Bros. revamped its advertising strategy for the video release of the film, including tie-ins with Honey Nut Cheerios, AOL and General Motors[48] and secured the backing of three U.S. congressmen (Ed Markey, Mark Foley and Howard Berman).[49] Awareness of the film was increased by its February 2000 release as a pay-per-view title, which also increased traffic to the film's website.[50]\n\nThe Iron Giant was released on VHS and DVD on November 23, 1999,[35] with a Laserdisc release following on December 6. Warner Bros. spent $35 million to market the home video release of the film.[51] The VHS edition came in three versions—pan and scan, pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case, and a widescreen version. All of the initial widescreen home video releases were in 1.85:1, the incorrect aspect ratio for the film.[35] In 2000, television rights to the film were sold to Cartoon Network and TNT for $3 million. Cartoon Network showed the film continuously for 24 consecutive hours in the early 2000s for such holidays as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving.[52][53]\n\nThe Special Edition DVD was released on November 16, 2004.[54] In 2014, Bird entered discussions with Warner Bros. regarding the possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu-ray. On April 23, he wrote on Twitter that \"WB &amp; I have been talking. But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better,\" and encouraged fans to send tweets to Warner Home Video in favor of a Special Edition Blu-ray of the film.[55] The film was ultimately released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2016, and included both the theatrical and 2015 Signature Edition cuts, as well as a documentary entitled The Giant's Dream that covered the making of the film.[56] This version also received a DVD release months earlier on February 16 with The Giant's Dream documentary removed.[12] This film became available on HBO Max on November 1, 2020.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Iron Giant received critical acclaim.[57] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 144 reviews with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The endearing Iron Giant tackles ambitious topics and complex human relationships with a steady hand and beautifully animated direction from Brad Bird.\"[58] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[59] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[60] The Reel Source forecasting service calculated that \"96–97%\" of audiences that attended recommended the film.[46]\n\nKenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it \"straight-arrow and subversive, [and] made with simplicity as well as sophistication,\" writing, \"it feels like a classic even though it's just out of the box.\"[61] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and compared it, both in story and animation, to the works of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki: \"Like the new Japanese animated films, The Iron Giant is happy to be a 'real movie' in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It's a story, plain and simple... It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.\" He concluded that it was \"not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.\"[62] The New Yorker reviewer Michael Sragow dubbed it a \"modern fairy tale\", writing, \"The movie provides a master class in the use of scale and perspective—and in its power to open up a viewer's heart and mind.\"[63] Time's Richard Schickel deemed it \"a smart live-and-let-live parable, full of glancing, acute observations on all kinds of big subjects—life, death, the military-industrial complex.\"[64] Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for The New York Times, deemed it a \"smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.\"[65] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt it \"beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art\", noting, \"be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting\".[66]\n\nBoth Hollywood trade publications were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted it to be a sleeper hit and called it \"outstanding\",[67] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it \"a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success.\"[68] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, \"I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant.\"[69] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes.[70] Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies.[71] The Washington Post's Stephen Hunter, while giving the film 4 out of 5 stars, opined, \"The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness.\"[72]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Iron Giant opened at Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, with a special ceremony preceding the screening in which a concrete slab bearing the title character's footprint was commemorated.[73] The film opened in Los Angeles and New York City on August 4, 1999,[47] with a wider national release occurring on August 6 in the United States. It opened in 2,179 theaters in the U.S., ranking at number nine at the box office accumulating $5.7 million over its opening weekend.[74] It was quick to drop out of the top ten; by its fourth week, it had accumulated only $18.9 million—far under its reported $50 million budget.[6][5][74] According to Dave McNary of the Los Angeles Daily News, \"Its weekend per-theater average was only $2,631, an average of $145 or perhaps 30 tickets per showing\"—leading theater owners to quickly discard the film.[46] At the time, Warner Bros. was shaken by the resignations of executives Bob Daly and Terry Semel, making the failure much worse.[46] T.L. Stanley of Brandweek cited it as an example of how media tie-ins were now essential to guaranteeing a film's success.[6]\n\nThe film went on to gross $23.2 million domestically and $8.1 million internationally for a total of $31.3 million worldwide.[37][5] Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and \"a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience.\"[46] Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, \"People always say to me, 'Why don't you make smarter family movies?' The lesson is, Every time you do, you get slaughtered.\"[75]\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe Hugo Awards nominated The Iron Giant for Best Dramatic Presentation,[76] while the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America honored Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies with the Nebula Award nomination.[77] The British Academy of Film and Television Arts gave the film a Children's Award as Best Feature Film.[78] In addition The Iron Giant won nine Annie Awards out of fifteen nominations, winning every category it was nominated for,[79] with another nomination for Best Home Video Release at The Saturn Awards.[80] IGN ranked The Iron Giant as the fifth favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010.[81] In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated The Iron Giant for its Top 10 Animated Films list.[82]\n\n| Award                                          | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                                                   | Recipients                                                                                                                    | Result    |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Annie Awards                                   | November 6, 1999    | Best Animated Feature Film                                                                 | Allison Abbate, Des McAnuff, and John Walker Warner Bros.

ever a possibility of a sequel, Bird stated that because the film was considered a financial failure, a sequel was not likely to ever happen, but he also stressed that he considered the story of The Iron Giant to be completely self-contained in the film and saw no need for extending the story.[83]\n\nThe Cartoon Network series Mad, did a parody of the movie as well as the film The Iron Lady for their Season 3 premiere entitled The Iron Giant Lady. In the sketch, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is the Giant and inspires other gynoids to take positions of political power.\n\nIn the Season 7 episode of Futurama entitled \"Assie Come Home\", the Iron Giant's head can be seen in Yuri's chop-shop in Filthytown.\n\nThe designers of the 2015 video game Ori and the Blind Forest were guided by inspirations from the film and Disney's The Lion King.[84]\n\nIn the Lego Movie spin-off series Unikitty!, the episode entitled \"Kaiju Kitty\" references the film's climatic moment of the Giant being blown up by the missile.\n\nThe Iron Giant appears in Steven Spielberg's 2018 science fiction film Ready Player One.[85][86] Aech had collected the parts of the Iron Giant, which she later controlled during the Battle of Castle Anorak, where he teams up with Gundam to fight Mechagodzilla. After the Iron Giant sacrifices itself and falls into a pool of lava, it gives a thumbs up to Wade and his crew while it sinks into the lava paying direct homage to the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day when the T-800 gives the thumbs up to both John &amp; Sarah Connor as it sacrifices itself into the molten steel.\n\nThe Iron Giant appears in Malcolm D. Lee's 2021 basketball film Space Jam: A New Legacy.[87] He is among the characters in the Warner Bros. 3000 Entertainment Server-Verse that watches the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad. After the Tune Squad won the game, the Giant shared a fist bump with King Kong.\n\nThe Iron Giant appears as a playable character in the fighting game MultiVersus on July 26, 2022, as a part of its \"open beta\".\n\nThe Iron Giant appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode, \"Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary\". He is among the remains of Blockbuster Island.\n\nBeto Tlahuetl, director of the Mexican music band \"Grupo Soñador\", stated that he was inspired by the movie to write the song \"El Gigante de Hierro\" (The Iron Giant) after dreaming of the Giant dancing in Los Angeles streets. The lyrics emphasize the theme of never giving up on a daughter's love by being the biggest protector.[88]\n\n### Signature Edition\n\nA remastered and extended cut of the film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015.[89] The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean in the cafe and the Giant's dream sequence.[90] Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film, but could not be finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were presented as deleted storyboard sequences on the 2004 DVD bonus features.[89] They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film, under Bird's supervision.[89] The film's Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016,[12] with an official Blu-ray release of this cut following on September 6.[13] Along with the additional scenes, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a nod to Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a reference regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.[16]\n\nOn March 14, 2016, coinciding with the release of the Signature Edition, it was announced that The Art of the Iron Giant would be written by Ramin Zahed and published by Insight Editions, featuring concept art and other materials from the film.[91]\n\n## See also\n\n- United States in the 1950s\n- The Beat Generation\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Although McCanlies received sole screenplay credit in the original theatrical prints and home video releases, Bird is credited in the film's 2015 restoration and the Signature Edition.[1][2]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The Iron Giant\".

            "spanned_content": "Now, I will rewrite the original article, inserting the appropriate XML tags where relevant.\n\n\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    <Name>The Iron Giant</Name>\n    <Genre>Animated Science Fiction</Genre>\n    <EmotionalImpact>Tearjerker</EmotionalImpact>\n    <Themes>Friendship, Identity, Sacrifice</Themes>\n    <ComplexityLevel>Moderate</ComplexityLevel>\n    <Director>Brad Bird</Director>\n    <ReleaseYear>1999</ReleaseYear>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\nThe Iron Giant is a <Genre>1999 American animated science fiction film</Genre> produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and directed by <Director>Brad Bird</Director> in his directorial debut. It is loosely based on the 1968 novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes (which was published in the United States as The Iron Giant), and was written by Tim McCanlies from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and M. Emmet Walsh. Set during the Cold War in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of the Who's Pete Townshend, though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using traditional animation, with computer-generated imagery used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. Michael Kamen composed the film's score, which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic. It was the final film by Warner Bros. Feature Animation to be fully animated and not a live-action/animation hybrid.\n\nThe Iron Giant premiered at Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6. The film significantly underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was attributed to Warner Bros.' lack of marketing and skepticism towards animated film production following the box office failure of Quest for Camelot in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, musical score, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick, Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal, and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic, and one of the greatest animated films ever made. In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically, and on home video the following year.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn October 1957, during the Cold War, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, young Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a gigantic alien robot; he flees, but returns to save the giant from being electrocuted when the giant attempts to eat a substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When the Giant eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, discovering that he can self-repair. Hogarth shows the Giant his comic books, and compares him to the hero Superman.\n\nThe incidents lead paranoid U.S. government agent Kent Mansley to Rockwell. Deducing Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother, Annie, Mansley rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys spending time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after they witness hunters killing a deer.\n\nMansley interrogates and detains Hogarth after discovering a photograph of Hogarth and the Giant together, then sends U.S. Army General Shannon Rogard and a platoon of soldiers to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence. Dean, having been forewarned by Hogarth, disguises the Giant as one of his art pieces, tricking the soldiers into leaving. While playing with a toy gun, Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system, which fires a laser. Dean yells at the Giant for nearly killing Hogarth, and the horrified Giant flees into downtown Rockwell, with Hogarth in pursuit. Dean discovers that the Giant was only acting in self-defense, and pursues them both.\n\nThe Giant rescues two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant, and Rogard orders his men to attack the robot, not realizing he is holding Hogarth. The Giant uses his flight system to evade the military at first, but is shot down and crash-lands.\n\nHogarth is rendered unconscious, but the Giant assumes that Hogarth is dead. The soldiers open fire, causing the Giant's defense systems to activate and begin attacking the army. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus, as conventional weapons seem to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and hastily calms down the Giant, while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard.\n\nRogard is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to deactivate its primed missile, but a panicked Mansley snatches Rogard's radio and orders the launch. Rogard reveals that, as the Giant has returned to Rockwell, the missile (which is targeted to him) will also destroy the town upon detonation. Mansley tries escaping, but the Giant thwarts him, and Rogard has Mansley arrested. To save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. Soaring into the missile's path, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words, \"You are who you choose to be,\" smiles contentedly, and declares himself \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the outer atmosphere, saving the soldiers and civilians in Rockwell. However, the Giant is presumably destroyed, devastating Hogarth, Dean, Annie, and Rogard.\n\nMonths later, Dean and Annie, now a couple, admire a memorial statue of the Giant that Dean has erected in the local park. Rogard gives Hogarth a package containing a screw from the Giant, which was the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland, and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n## Voice cast\n\n- Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, an intelligent, curious, energetic, and courageous 9-year-old boy with an active imagination. Marienthal's performances were videotaped and given to animators to work with, which helped develop expressions and acting for the character. He is named after author Ted Hughes, who wrote the book that inspired the film, and artist Burne Hogarth.\n- Jennifer Aniston as Annie Hughes, Hogarth's mother, the widow of a military pilot, and a diner waitress. According to Bird, Aniston was the only casting suggestion made by Warner Bros. execs that he personally really liked and approved.\n- Harry Connick Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik artist and junkyard owner. Bird felt it appropriate to make the character a member of the Beat Generation, as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.\n- Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant, a 50 ft., metal-eating robot. Of unknown origin and created for an unknown purpose, the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it. The Giant's voice was originally going to be electronically modulated but the filmmakers decided they \"needed a deep, resonant and expressive voice to start with\", so they hired Diesel.\n- James Gammon as Foreman Marv Loach, a power station employee who follows the robot's trail after it destroys the station.\n- Cloris Leachman as Karen Tensedge, Hogarth's fourth grade teacher at Redford Elementary School.\n- Christopher McDonald as Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal government agent sent to investigate sightings of the Iron Giant. The logo on his official government car says he is from the \"Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena\".\n- John Mahoney as General Shannon Rogard, an experienced and level-headed military leader in Washington, D.C., Mansley's superior at the Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena who goes from merely being annoyed and exasperated with Mansley to openly despising him.\n- M. Emmet Walsh as Earl Stutz, a sailor and the first man to see the Giant.\n\nIn addition, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas voice the train's engineers briefly seen near the start of the film. Johnston and Thomas, who were animators and members of Disney's Nine Old Men, were cited by Bird as inspirations for his career, which he honored by incorporating their voices, likenesses, and first names into the film.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nThe origins of the film lie in the book The Iron Man (1968), by poet Ted Hughes, who wrote the novel for his children to comfort them in the wake of their mother Sylvia Plath's suicide. In the 1980s, rock musician Pete Townshend chose to adapt the book for a concept album; it was released as The Iron Man: A Musical in 1989. In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film's lead animator, pitched a version of The Iron Man to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland. He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project. After a stage musical was mounted in London, Des McAnuff, who had adapted Tommy with Townshend for the stage, believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment.\n\nIn late 1996, while developing the project on its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for <Director>Brad Bird</Director>, who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation developing Ray Gunn. Turner Broadcasting had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner, and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant. After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros. This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book, Dean and Kent, setting the film in America, and discarding Townshend's musical ambitions (who did not care either way, reportedly remarking, \"Well, whatever, I got paid\"). Bird would expand upon his desire to set the film in America in the 1950s in a later interview:\n\nThe Maine setting looks Norman Rockwell idyllic on the outside, but inside everything is just about to boil over; everyone was scared of the bomb, the Russians, Sputnik — even rock and roll. This clenched Ward Cleaver smile masking fear (which is really what the Kent character was all about). It was the perfect environment to drop a 50-foot-tall robot into.\n\nTed Hughes, the original story's author, died before the film's release. His daughter, Frieda Hughes, saw the finished film on his behalf and loved it. Townshend, who stayed on as the film's executive producer, enjoyed the final film as well.\n\n### Writing\n\nTim McCanlies was hired to write the script, though Bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself. He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival, stating, \"You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back.\" McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. \"didn't have time to mess with us\" as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as \"paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling.\" Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, \"I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He's made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He's made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he's developed The Iron Giant. I can't stop thinking about it.\"\n\nBird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons as an example of working under strict deadlines. He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly. One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. \"There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's almost as if the audience has the remote and they're going to change channels,\" he commented at the time. Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the \"hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.\" Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the \"Duck and Cover\" sequence came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film. Nicknamed \"The X-Factor\" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script.\n\n### Animation\n\nThe financial failure of Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, which made the studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giant's production considerably. \"Three-quarters\" of the animation team on that film helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\" A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees\", said production designer Mark Whiting.\n\nBird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed animatics, to make sure there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed \"Macro\" early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\" The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.\n\nHe opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created. The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner\". They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion. The Giant consisted of 7000 parts (the Battle Giant had 10,000 parts), and was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston and refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant. Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model. Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\" Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including Alias Systems Corporation's Maya, Alias' PowerAnimator, a modified version of Pixar's RenderMan, Softimage 3D, Cambridge Animation's Animo (now part of Toon Boom Technologies), Avid Elastic Reality, and Adobe Photoshop.\n\nThe art of Norman Rockwell, Edward Hopper and N.C. Wyeth inspired the design. Whiting strove for colors both evocative of the time period in which the film is set and also representative of its emotional tone; for example, Hogarth's room is designed to reflect his \"youth and sense of wonder\". That was blended with a style reminiscent of 1950s illustration. Animators studied Chuck Jones, Hank Ketcham, Al Hirschfeld and Disney films from that era, such as 101 Dalmatians, for inspiration in the film's animation.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for the film was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, making it the only film directed by Bird not to be scored by his future collaborator, Michael Giacchino, as of December 2024. Bird's original temp score, \"a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from '50s and '60s sci-fi films,\" initially scared Kamen. Believing the sound of the orchestra is important to the feeling of the film, Kamen \"decided to comb eastern Europe for an \"old-fashioned\" sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss's An Alpine Symphony.\" Eventually, the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film's score, with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as \"an amazing collection of musicians\". The score for The Iron Giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner, compared to most films: recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague, the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music, in a method Kamen described in a 1999 interview as \"[being able to] play the music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire.\" Kamen's score for The Iron Giant won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999.\n\n### Post-production\n\nBird opted to produce The Iron Giant in widescreen—specifically the wide 2.39:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio—but was warned against doing so by his advisers. He felt it was appropriate to use the format, as many films from the late 1950s were produced in such widescreen formats. He hoped to include the CinemaScope logo on a poster, partially as a joke, but 20th Century Fox, owner of the trademark, refused.\n\nBird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop. This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, \"If they were interested in telling the story, they should let it be what it wants to be.\" The film was also initially going to be released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo which features mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo eating a carrot as seen in the film's teaser trailer. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, mainly because he felt that the logo did not fit the tone of the movie, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts. He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion.\n\nAccording to a report from the time of its release, The Iron Giant cost $50 million to produce with an additional $30 million going towards marketing, though Box Office Mojo later reported its budget as $70 million. It was regarded as a lower-budget film, in comparison to the films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\n## Themes\n\nWhen he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote The Iron Man as a means of comforting his children after his wife, Sylvia Plath, died by suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan. McCanlies commented that \"at a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out for the rest of your life\", adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would \"make us feel like we're all part of humanity [which] is something we need to feel.\" When some critics compared the film to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Bird responded by saying \"E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay. Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt.\"\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nWe had toy people and all of that kind of material ready to go, but all of that takes a year! Burger King and the like wanted to be involved. In April we showed them the movie, and we were on time. They said, \"You'll never be ready on time.\" No, we were ready on time. We showed it to them in April and they said, \"We'll put it out in a couple of months.\" That's a major studio, they have 30 movies a year, and they just throw them off the dock and see if they either sink or swim, because they've got the next one in right behind it. After they saw the reviews they [Warner Bros.] were a little shamefaced.\n\nThe Iron Giant was a commercial failure during its theatrical release; consensus among critics was that its failure was, in part, due to lack of promotion from Warner Bros. This was largely attributable to the reception of Quest for Camelot; after its release, Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April 1999. After wildly successful test screenings, the studio was shocked by the response: the test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years, according to Bird. They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film—such as cereal and fast food tie-ins—with little time left before its scheduled release. Bird remembered that the studio produced one teaser poster for the film, which became its eventual poster. Brad Ball, who had been assigned the role of marketing the film, was candid after its release, noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan. IGN stated that \"In a mis-marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros., they simply didn't realize what they had on their hands.\"\n\nThe studio needed an $8 million opening to ensure success, but they were unable to properly promote it preceding the release. They nearly delayed the film by several months to better prepare. \"They said, 'we should delay it and properly lead up to its release,' and I said 'you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this,'\" recalled Bird. Press outlets took note of its absence of marketing, with some reporting that the studio had spent more money on marketing for the intended summer blockbuster Wild Wild West instead. Warner Bros. scheduled Sunday sneak preview screenings for the film prior to its release, as well as a preview of the film on the online platform Webcastsneak.\n\n### Home media and television syndication\n\nAfter criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release, Warner Bros. revamped its advertising strategy for the video release of the film, including tie-ins with Honey Nut Cheerios, AOL and General Motors and secured the backing of three U.S. congressmen (Ed Markey, Mark Foley and Howard Berman). Awareness of the film was increased by its February 2000 release as a pay-per-view title, which also increased traffic to the film's website.\n\nThe Iron Giant was released on VHS and DVD on November 23, 1999, with a Laserdisc release following on December 6. Warner Bros. spent $35 million to market the home video release of the film. The VHS edition came in three versions—pan and scan, pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case, and a widescreen version. All of the initial widescreen home video releases were in 1.85:1, the incorrect aspect ratio for the film. In 2000, television rights to the film were sold to Cartoon Network and TNT for $3 million. Cartoon Network showed the film continuously for 24 consecutive hours in the early 2000s for such holidays as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Special Edition DVD was released on November 16, 2004. In 2014, Bird entered discussions with Warner Bros. regarding the possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu-ray. On April 23, he wrote on Twitter that \"WB & I have been talking. But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better,\" and encouraged fans to send tweets to Warner Home Video in favor of a Special Edition Blu-ray of the film. The film was ultimately released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2016, and included both the theatrical and 2015 Signature Edition cuts, as well as a documentary entitled The Giant's Dream that covered the making of the film. This version also received a DVD release months earlier on February 16 with The Giant's Dream documentary removed. This film became available on HBO Max on November 1, 2020.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Iron Giant received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 144 reviews with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The endearing Iron Giant tackles ambitious topics and complex human relationships with a steady hand and beautifully animated direction from Brad Bird.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. The Reel Source forecasting service calculated that \"96–97%\" of audiences that attended recommended the film.\n\nKenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it \"straight-arrow and subversive, [and] made with simplicity as well as sophistication,\" writing, \"it feels like a classic even though it's just out of the box.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and compared it, both in story and animation, to the works of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki: \"Like the new Japanese animated films, The Iron Giant is happy to be a 'real movie' in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It's a story, plain and simple... It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.\" He concluded that it was \"not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.\" The New Yorker reviewer Michael Sragow dubbed it a \"modern fairy tale\", writing, \"The movie provides a master class in the use of scale and perspective—and in its power to open up a viewer's heart and mind.\" Time's Richard Schickel deemed it \"a smart live-and-let-live parable, full of glancing, acute observations on all kinds of big subjects—life, death, the military-industrial complex.\" Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for The New York Times, deemed it a \"smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt it \"beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art\", noting, \"be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting.\"\n\nBoth Hollywood trade publications were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted it to be a sleeper hit and called it \"outstanding\", while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it \"a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success.\" Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, \"I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant.\" Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. The Washington Post's Stephen Hunter, while giving the film 4 out of 5 stars, opined, \"The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness.\"\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Iron Giant opened at Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, with a special ceremony preceding the screening in which a concrete slab bearing the title character's footprint was commemorated. The film opened in Los Angeles and New York City on August 4, 1999, with a wider national release occurring on August 6 in the United States. It opened in 2,179 theaters in the U.S., ranking at number nine at the box office accumulating $5.7 million over its opening weekend. It was quick to drop out of the top ten; by its fourth week, it had accumulated only $18.9 million—far under its reported $50 million budget. According to Dave McNary of the Los Angeles Daily News, \"Its weekend per-theater average was only $2,631, an average of $145 or perhaps 30 tickets per showing\"—leading theater owners to quickly discard the film. At the time, Warner Bros. was shaken by the resignations of executives Bob Daly and Terry Semel, making the failure much worse. T.L. Stanley of Brandweek cited it as an example of how media tie-ins were now essential to guaranteeing a film's success.\n\nThe film went on to gross $23.2 million domestically and $8.1 million internationally for a total of $31.3 million worldwide. Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and \"a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience.\" Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, \"People always say to me, 'Why don't you make smarter family movies?' The lesson is, Every time you do, you get slaughtered.\"\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe Hugo Awards nominated The Iron Giant for Best Dramatic Presentation, while the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America honored Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies with the Nebula Award nomination. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts gave the film a Children's Award as Best Feature Film. In addition, The Iron Giant won nine Annie Awards out of fifteen nominations, winning every category it was nominated for, with another nomination for Best Home Video Release at The Saturn Awards. IGN ranked The Iron Giant as the fifth favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated The Iron Giant for its Top 10 Animated Films list.\n\n| Award                                          | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                                                   | Recipients                                                                                                                    | Result    |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Annie Awards                                   | November 6, 1999    | Best Animated Feature Film                                                                 | Allison Abbate, Des McAnuff, and John Walker Warner Bros.

In 2018, when questioned over social media if there was ever a possibility of a sequel, Bird stated that because the film was considered a financial failure, a sequel was not likely to ever happen, but he also stressed that he considered the story of The Iron Giant to be completely self-contained in the film and saw no need for extending the story.\n\nThe Cartoon Network series Mad, did a parody of the movie as well as the film The Iron Lady for their Season 3 premiere entitled The Iron Giant Lady. In the sketch, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is the Giant and inspires other gynoids to take positions of political power.\n\nIn the Season 7 episode of Futurama entitled \"Assie Come Home\", the Iron Giant's head can be seen in Yuri's chop-shop in Filthytown.\n\nThe designers of the 2015 video game Ori and the Blind Forest were guided by inspirations from the film and Disney's The Lion King.\n\nIn the Lego Movie spin-off series Unikitty!, the episode entitled \"Kaiju Kitty\" references the film's climatic moment of the Giant being blown up by the missile.\n\nThe Iron Giant appears in Steven Spielberg's 2018 science fiction film Ready Player One. Aech had collected the parts of the Iron Giant, which she later controlled during the Battle of Castle Anorak, where he teams up with Gundam to fight Mechagodzilla. After the Iron Giant sacrifices itself and falls into a pool of lava, it gives a thumbs up to Wade and his crew while it sinks into the lava paying direct homage to the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day when the T-800 gives the thumbs up to both John & Sarah Connor as it sacrifices itself into the molten steel.\n\nThe Iron Giant appears in Malcolm D. Lee's 2021 basketball film Space Jam: A New Legacy. He is among the characters in the Warner Bros. 3000 Entertainment Server-Verse that watches the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad. After the Tune Squad won the game, the Giant shared a fist bump with King Kong.\n\nThe Iron Giant appears as a playable character in the fighting game MultiVersus on July 26, 2022, as a part of its \"open beta\".\n\nThe Iron Giant appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode, \"Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary\". He is among the remains of Blockbuster Island.\n\nBeto Tlahuetl, director of the Mexican music band \"Grupo Soñador\", stated that he was inspired by the movie to write the song \"El Gigante de Hierro\" (The Iron Giant) after dreaming of the Giant dancing in Los Angeles streets. The lyrics emphasize the theme of never giving up on a daughter's love by being the biggest protector.\n\n### Signature Edition\n\nA remastered and extended cut of the film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015. The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean in the cafe and the Giant's dream sequence. Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film, but could not be finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were presented as deleted storyboard sequences on the 2004 DVD bonus features. They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film, under Bird's supervision. The film's Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016, with an official Blu-ray release of this cut following on September 6. Along with the additional scenes, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a nod to Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a reference regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.\n\nOn March 14, 2016, coinciding with the release of the Signature Edition, it was announced that The Art of the Iron Giant would be written by Ramin Zahed and published by Insight Editions, featuring concept art and other materials from the film.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while incorporating the required XML tags to highlight the relevant attributes of the movie recommendation.",

Of course, being a white person, I can’t say with any absolute sense what that feels like, but I can imagine it can be overwhelming at certain times. Eventually, you would become somewhat numb but never enough to escape the torment of it, to be constantly reminded of an artificial inferiority imposed on you by a culture of people who revel in their mediocrity. As a result, in the United States, there have been waves of Black cinema, each with its own distinct tones &amp; styles, attempting to capture &amp; communicate a feeling of what it felt like to be Black at that time.\n\nToday, we have a much more mainstream series of films from directors about Blackness coming from directors like Jordan Peele, Barry Jenkins, and Nia DaCosta, just to name a few. Previously, the 1990s saw a rise in Black films about experiences of racism and violence in their communities, developing in tandem with the hip-hop/rap movement. Before that, an often ignored Black New Wave emerged in the 1970s. Most people are familiar with Blaxploitation, but many movies were inspired by the Italian New Wave. That film movement focused on the day-to-day lives of ordinary people, often showcasing situations where people had to compromise their values to aid their family’s survival. For example, Vittorio DiSica’s Bicycle Thieves is an inspiration for Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep, a series of vignettes that explore the lives of Black people living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nKiller of Sheep feels almost documentary, a non-narrative that lets the camera explore the space with actors essentially playing versions of themselves. Stan (Henry G. Sanders) is the patriarch, working long hours at a slaughterhouse, making him the titular Killer of Sheep. There are graphic images of Stan bleeding out the sheep, skinning, and gutting them, but he gives no reaction. But the effects of this violent drudgery seep into his home life with his two children, Stan Jr. and Angela, and his unnamed wife. Stan is coerced by friends into taking part in a crime. An older white woman propositions Stan for sex at her store. There’s a sequence where Stan and a friend buy a car engine failing to get it back to the house. This is the story of a working-class Black person trying to keep himself and his family alive in a world full of obstacles.\n\nThere is the authenticity of life found in Killer of Sheep that few movies, even contemporary indie flicks, fail to capture. The previously mentioned engine sequence is a perfect example of that. Stan and his friend Bracy struggle to carry the engine by hand to the open tailgate of a pick-up truck. Bracy is tired and leaves the engine just over the lip of the tailgate, telling Stan it’s so heavy it won’t budge as they drive. Stan is reticent but goes along; he, too, is exhausted from working and now exerting what little energy he has left to do this. They get in the truck, and almost as soon as the gas is pressed, the engine block tumbles off and onto the street. A quick survey leads Bracy to say it’s cracked and now near useless.\n\nThis is such a small moment in cinema, but we’ve been there in our lives. We’ve been ground to the bone and have to handle some annoying errands after work. And then, to have all that extra effort be for nothing, it’s a micro-tragedy felt on a massive psychological scale. But it’s also an apt metaphor for life as part of the working class and even more relevant to working-class Black people. When you are poor, even the slightest setback can be devastating. Of course, the wealthy can recover from pretty much anything like that, but Stan will struggle even more.\n\nBurnett isn’t trying to make some sweeping statement or play into grandiose themes. Instead, he searches for the poetic beauty of living and surviving against the odds. He touches on toxic masculinity, showing a father chastising his son for not violently beating up another kid fighting his brother. When I was a teacher, I chose to work primarily in Title I schools which, where I live, means a student body of majority Black children. I didn’t do this because I wanted the praise of being a white savior; my mindset was simply these are the places that need more, not the schools that already have everything because of their zip codes. It was common to hear children, and sometimes parents, talk casually about violence as the best means to solve conflicts. I couldn’t judge them because I wasn’t living their lives under the conditions they were often stuck in. It’s easy for me to talk about the pointlessness of turning on each other out of frustration when the real evil is tucked safely inside a gated community on the other side of the city. Black people understand this, but they also have to engage in a complex social hierarchy imposed on them by the white establishment in the form of the police. Trickle-down economics was a pipe dream, but trickle-down violence is all too real.\n\nBurnett knows this, too, and doesn’t judge his characters as he portrays their lives. Unlike the castigating glare of Tyler Perry, a man with some definite self-hate, as we’ve talked about earlier, Burnett sees beauty in his characters’ flaws and struggles. Stan comes home after work and immediately starts laying linoleum in the kitchen, fixing a leaky sink, and trying to find some time to spend with children and alone time with his wife. Burnett’s camera is in no rush, giving us lingering moments, focused on a face here or there, not making any sort of statement but wanting us to see it, faces that are often invisible in the more prominent corners of media.\n\nMusic is omnipresent, a part of reality in Black life. Music is joy; music is the brightening of life. He also understands that Black people don’t simply listen to Black music, including pieces by Rachmaninov and Gershwin. These musical tracks serve to heighten the beauty, taking what is traditionally used to accentuate whiteness and using it to highlight the poetic beauty of Black life. Paul Robeson’s signature bass-baritone reminds us of one of the most remarkable Black singers to ever live. Dinah Washington’s “This Bitter Earth” plays while Stan and his wife, finding a quiet moment, dance in their living room, backlit by a singular window.\n\nBurnett doesn’t ignore the inner lives of the children, who seem to exist in a separate world as the adults work day and night. The games the boys engage in are all recreations of war, two sides pitted against each other, trying to claim more territory. Plywood boards are used as shields, the phalanx marching forward and gaining inch by inch. Rocks are thrown as the other side peeks up over their dirt hill. A child is struck by a rock and cries. The game stops. The children gather in a circle. The wounded will be okay. But the game is over, and we follow some children as they drift to nearby train tracks trying to decide what game is next. Burnett rehearsed none of the scenes with the children, so these are real interactions in front of us.\n\nKiller of Sheep isn’t a dour, moody film; it is rife with humor too. Burnett has an excellent ear for how people around him speak and recreates it here. These are not people moping around, feeling burdened. The weight is on their shoulders, no doubt, but they love so much of life. They love the people in their family &amp; community. They find satisfaction in work but understand there is a line, and part of their lives are taken from by being overworked. You can definitely see the influence of this picture on Barry Jenkins, who carries many of these themes &amp; images into Moonlight.\n\nThis will be the first of four Charles Burnett pictures I’ll be reviewing, with each one different, some dramatically so, charting the progression of this director from his beginnings in the 1970s to an African war epic in the mid-2000s. I want to introduce you to his work and get you intrigued enough to go out and watch some of his films on your own.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n- Click to print (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Author: Seth Harris\n\nAn immigrant from the U.S. trying to make sense of an increasingly saddening world.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tView all posts by Seth Harris\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## One thought on “Movie Review – Killer of Sheep”\n\n- Pingback: Seth’s Favorite Film Discoveries of 2023 – PopCult Reviews\n\n## Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nΔ\n\n## Post navigation\n\n## Archives\n\n##\n\n## Email Subscription\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\nEmail Address:\n\nSign me up!\n\nJoin 428 other subscribers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Goodreads\n\n- PopCult Podcast\n- Digest Archive\n- LinkTree\n- PopCult on Patreon\n- Beloved Patrons\n\n- Comment\n- Reblog\n- Subscribe Subscribed\n    - PopCult Reviews\n    - Join 428 other subscribers\n    - Already have a WordPress.com account?

The film, starring Robin Williams, is set in 1959 at a fictional elite boarding school called Welton Academy,[4] and tells the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.\n\nDead Poets Society was released in the United States on June 2, 1989. The film was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $235 million worldwide, became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1989, and received generally positive reviews from critics. The film received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director, as well as a Best Actor nomination for Williams. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Film,[5] the César Award for Best Foreign Film and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Film. Schulman received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his work.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1959, Todd Anderson begins his junior year of high school at Welton Academy, an Episcopalian all-male preparatory boarding school in Vermont.  Todd is assigned one of Welton's top students, junior Neil Perry, as his roommate, and through Neil, he meets his friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton.\n\nOn the first day of classes, the boys are taken aback by the unusual teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus who studied English Literature at Cambridge, Keating encourages his students to \"seize the day\", referencing the Latin expression carpe diem.\n\nKeating has the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, tells them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books that explains a mathematical formula for rating poetry, and invites them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating's methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan.\n\nUpon learning that Keating had been a member of the unofficial Dead Poets Society during his time as a student at Welton, Neil restarts the club, and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave, where they read poetry. Keating's lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school, and whose family is friends with his.\n\nNeil discovers his love of acting, and gets the role of Puck in a local production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, despite the disapproval of his controlling father, who wants him to attend Harvard to study medicine. Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his spontaneously composing a poem in front of the class.\n\nCharlie publishes an article in the school newspaper, on behalf of the club, recommending that girls be admitted to Welton. In response, Nolan paddles Charlie, attempting to force him to reveal who else is in the Dead Poets Society; but Charlie remains defiant. Nolan also confronts Keating, advising him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating admonishes the boys, warning them that one must assess all potential consequences of one's actions.\n\nOn the eve of the play's opening performance, Neil's father discovers his involvement in the play and demands that he quit immediately. Keating advises Neil to stand his ground to prove to his father that he takes acting seriously. After Neil performs in the play, his father retaliates by withdrawing him from Welton and enrolling him in Braden Military School. Lacking any support from his mother and unable to explain to his father how he feels, Neil commits suicide using his father's gun.\n\nAt Neil's parents' request, Nolan investigates his death. During the investigation, Cameron shifts blame onto Keating to avoid punishment for his role in the Dead Poets Society, and he names the other members of the group. When Charlie confronts him over this, Cameron urges the other students to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's office to sign a letter confirming Cameron's false allegations. When Todd's turn comes, he reluctantly signs the letter under the pressure of his parents, and Keating is fired as a result.\n\nNolan, who had taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, temporarily takes over Keating's English class. As Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings, Todd confesses that the boys were pressured into signing the letter that led to his dismissal. Keating assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite the threat, Todd stands up on his desk and says \"O Captain! My Captain!\".  The other members of the Dead Poets Society, except for Cameron, along with several other students in the class, follow suit. Touched by their support, Keating proudly thanks the boys before departing.\n\n## Cast\n\nRobin Williams plays John Keating.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Robin Williams as John Keating, new English teacher\n- Robert Sean Leonard as Neil Perry\n- Ethan Hawke as Todd Anderson\n- Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet\n- Gale Hansen as Charlie Dalton\n- Dylan Kussman as Richard Cameron\n- Allelon Ruggiero as Steven Meeks\n- James Waterston as Gerard Pitts\n- Norman Lloyd as Dr. Gale Nolan, headmaster of Welton Academy\n- Kurtwood Smith as Thomas Perry, Neil's domineering father\n- Alexandra Powers as Chris Noel, Knox's love interest and a cheerleader at Ridgeway High.\n- Melora Walters as Gloria, Tina's friend.\n- Welker White as Tina, invited into the Dead Poets Society by Charlie.\n- Leon Pownall as George McAllister, Latin teacher[6]\n- George Martin as Dr. Hager, mathematics teacher\n- Carla Belver as Mrs. Perry, Neil's mother who is scared of her husband.\n- Jane Moore as Mrs. Danburry\n- Kevin Cooney as Joe Danburry, Chet's father and a friend of Knox's family.\n- Colin Irving as Chet Danburry, Chris's boyfriend and a football player at Ridgeway High.\n- Matt Carey as Kurt Hopkins, a student at Welton.\n- John Cunningham as Mr. Anderson\n- Lara Flynn Boyle as Ginny Danburry, Chet's younger sister (scenes deleted)\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nThe original script was written by Tom Schulman, based on his experiences at the Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tennessee, particularly with his inspirational teacher, Samuel Pickering.[7][8][9] Jeff Kanew was originally hired as the director, and Kanew had envisioned Liam Neeson in the role of Keating.[10] Other actors considered for the role were Dustin Hoffman,[11] Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks and Mickey Rourke.[12][13] Robin Williams, who was Touchstone Pictures's preferred choice, was ultimately cast, but on the first day of shooting outside Atlanta, Williams did not show, for he did not want to work with Kanew.[14] The studio burned down the already-built sets, and replaced Kanew with another director.[14]\n\nIn late 1988, Peter Weir met with Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney. Katzenberg, who oversaw Touchstone Pictures, suggested that Weir read Schulman's script. On the flight back to Sydney, Weir was captivated, and six weeks later returned to Los Angeles to cast the principal characters.[15] It was when Weir was given directing duties that filming began in earnest.[14] In Schulman's manuscript, Keating had been ill and slowly dying of Hodgkin lymphoma, with a scene showing him on his hospital deathbed. This was removed by Weir, who deemed it unnecessary, reasoning that it would focus audiences' attention on Keating's illness, rather than on what he stood for.[16] Early notes on the script from Disney also suggested making the boys' passion dancing rather than poetry, as well as a new title, Sultans of Swing, focusing on the character of Mr. Keating, rather than on the boys, but both were dismissed outright.[15]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming began in November 1988, and wrapped in January 1989. After filmmakers scouted more than 70 different universities and private schools, they decided that Dead Poets Society would take place at St. Andrew's School and the Everett Theatre in Middletown, Delaware, as well as at locations in New Castle, Delaware, and in nearby Wilmington, Delaware.[9][17][18] Classroom scenes with Keating were filmed in a replica classroom built on a soundstage in Wilmington.[9] To emphasize a film set back in time, storefronts in Delaware towns were transformed, with all modern conveniences removed.[18] During the shooting, Weir requested that the young cast not use modern slang, even off camera.[19] Weir also said that he hid a half-day's filming from Disney executives to allow Williams free range to use his comedic improvisational skills.[20]\n\nDead Poets Society held two open casting calls, in which more than 3,000 extras were used.[18] During filming, Williams cracked many jokes on set, which Ethan Hawke found irritating. However, Hawke's first agent signed with Hawke when Williams told him that Hawke would \"do really well\".[21][20]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe worldwide box office was reported as $235,860,579, which includes domestic grosses of $95,860,116.[3] The film's global receipts were the fifth-highest for 1989, and the highest for dramas.[22]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Dead Poets Society holds an approval rating of 85%, based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Affecting performances from the young cast and a genuinely inspirational turn from Robin Williams grant Peter Weir's prep school drama top honors\".[23] On Metacritic, the film received a score of 79, based on 15 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[24] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on a scale of A+ to F.[25]\n\nThe Washington Post's reviewer called it \"solid, smart entertainment\", and praised Robin Williams for giving a \"nicely restrained acting performance\".[26] Vincent Canby of The New York Times also praised Williams' \"exceptionally fine performance\", while writing that \"Dead Poets Society... is far less about Keating than about a handful of impressionable boys\".[4]\n\nPauline Kael was unconvinced about the film and its \"middlebrow highmindedness\", but praised Williams. \"Robin Williams' performance is more graceful than anything he's done before [–] he's totally, concentratedly there – [he] reads his lines stunningly, and when he mimics various actors reciting Shakespeare there's no undue clowning in it; he's a gifted teacher demonstrating his skills.\"[27] Roger Ebert's review for the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of four. He criticized Williams for spoiling an otherwise creditable dramatic performance by occasionally veering into his onstage comedian's persona, and lamented that for a film set in the 1950s, there was no mention of the Beat Generation writers popular among college students of the era. Additionally, Ebert described the film as an often poorly constructed \"collection of pious platitudes.... The movie pays lip service to qualities and values that, on the evidence of the screenplay itself, it is cheerfully willing to abandon.\"[28]\n\nOn their Oscar-nomination edition of Siskel &amp; Ebert, both Gene Siskel (who also gave the film a mixed review) and Ebert disagreed with Williams' Oscar nomination. Ebert said that he would have swapped Williams with either Matt Dillon for Drugstore Cowboy or John Cusack for Say Anything.[29] On their If We Picked the Winners special in March 1990, Ebert chose the film's Best Picture nomination as the worst nomination of the year, believing that it took a slot that could have gone to Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing.[30] Film historian Leonard Maltin wrote: \"Well made, extremely well acted, but also dramatically obvious and melodramatically one-sided. Nevertheless, Tom Schulman's screenplay won an Oscar.\"[31]\n\nJohn Simon, writing for National Review, said that Dead Poets Society was the most dishonest film that he had seen in some time.[32] Richard Schickel reviewed the film for Time, commenting: \"Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity.\"[33] Kevin Dettmar wrote in The Atlantic: \"The beloved film's portrayal of studying literature is both misleading and deeply seductive.\" He commented further on how literature was taught in the film (by Robin Williams's character John Keating), describing it as \"the literary equivalent of fandom,\" and \"anti-intellectual.\"[34]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                       | Category                                                | Nominee(s)                                                 | Result    | Ref.    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Academy Awards                              | Best Picture                                            | Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt, and Tony Thomas             | Nominated | [35]    |\n| Academy Awards                              | Best Director                                           | Peter Weir                                                 | Nominated | [35]    |\n| Academy Awards                              | Best Actor                                              | Robin Williams                                             | Nominated | [35]    |\n| Academy Awards                              | Best Original Screenplay                                | Tom Schulman                                               | Won       | [35]    |\n| Argentine Film Critics Association Awards   | Best Foreign Film                                       | Peter Weir                                                 | Nominated |         |\n| Artios Awards                               | Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film Casting – Drama | Howard Feuer                                               | Won       | [36]    |\n| ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards      | Top Box Office Films                                    | Maurice Jarre                                              | Won       |         |\n| British Academy Film Awards                 | Best Film                                               | Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt, Tony Thomas, and Peter Weir | Won       | [37]    |\n| British Academy Film Awards                 | Best Direction                                          | Peter Weir                                                 | Nominated | [37]    |\n| British Academy Film Awards                 | Best Actor in a Leading Role                            | Robin Williams                                             | Nominated | [37]    |\n| British Academy Film Awards                 | Best Screenplay – Original                              | Tom Schulman                                               | Nominated | [37]    |\n| British Academy Film Awards                 | Best Editing                                            | William M.

Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.\", was voted as the 95th greatest movie quote by the American Film Institute.[49][50]\n\n### Legacy\n\nAfter Robin Williams' death in August 2014, fans of his work used social media to pay tribute to him with photo and video reenactments of the film's final \"O Captain! My Captain!\" scene.[51] Upon hearing about Robin William's death, many teachers came forward to pay him their respects online, and even revealed that they were inspired to become teachers because of his character, Mr. Keating, from Dead Poets Society.[52]\n\nEthan Hawke and Josh Charles feature prominently in the music video for \"Fortnight\" by American singer Taylor Swift from her album The Tortured Poets Department (2024), as a nod to the similarity between the two titles.[53]\n\n## Adaptations\n\n### Novelization\n\nNancy H. Kleinbaum's novel, Dead Poets Society (1989), is based on the movie.[54]\n\n### Stage play\n\nA theatrical adaptation written by Tom Schulman and directed by John Doyle opened off-Broadway October 27, 2016, and ran through December 11, 2016.[55] Jason Sudeikis starred as John Keating,[56] with Thomas Mann as Neil Perry, David Garrison as Gale Nolan, Zane Pais as Todd Anderson, Francesca Carpanini as Chris, Stephen Barker Turner as Mr. Perry, Will Hochman as Knox Overstreet, Cody Kostro as Charlie Dalton, Yaron Lotan as Richard Cameron, and Bubba Weiler as Steven Meeks.[57][58] The production received a mixed review from The New York Times, with critic Ben Brantley calling the play \"blunt and bland\", and criticizing Sudeikis' performance, citing his lack of enthusiasm when delivering powerful lines.[59]\n\nIn 2018, the theatrical adaptation of the film, written by Tom Schulman and directed by Francisco Franco, premiered in Mexico. The Mexican actor, Alfonso Herrera, played the main character.[60] An adaptation was made for the Bad Hersfelder Festspiele in Germany, also with the assistance of Tom Schulman. It premiered in July 2021, and was still staged two years later. The lead actor was Francis Fulton-Smith.[61]\n\n### Parodies\n\nThe ending of the film was parodied in the 2009 Community episode, \"Introduction to Film\".[62] It was also parodied in the 2016 Saturday Night Live sketch, \"Farewell, Mr. Bunting\", with Fred Armisen playing Williams' role. The sketch is a largely faithful recreation of the scene, until a student (Pete Davidson) is decapitated by a ceiling fan when he jumps on top of his desk.[63]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Dead Poets Society\".

He deliberately left his name off of the credits, as he knew that people would get the wrong idea about the movie if they saw his name on the movie, given his fame as a satirist.\n\n- GoofsDuring Merrick's visit with Treves and his wife at their home, he shows them a picture of his mother. He expresses his desire to find her someday, but in reality his mother died when he was 11 years of age from bronchial pneumonia.\n\n- QuotesJohn Merrick: I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT! I AM NOT AN ANIMAL! I AM... A HUMAN BEING! I... AM... A... MAN!\n\n- Crazy creditsClosing disclaimer:\nThis has been based upon the true life story of John Merrick, known as The Elephant Man, and not upon the Broadway play of the same title or any other fictional account.\n\n- Alternate versionsIn the ending scene of the extended edition after Merrick's mother recites Lord Tennyson's \"Nothing Will Die\", we see the African elephants from the opening scene striking down Merrick's mother. After the elephant attack, we see the smoke/dust rising upward, with a baby wailing in the background ending the extended edition (coming on December 2024).\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Randy Loves Movies!!1!: THE BOOK OF BOBA FETT FULL BREAKDOWN!

One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one's sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), 'The Elephant Man,' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. There he is. And it's no big deal. \n\nThis is the beauty of Lynch's direction. We are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. We develop alongside them. More specifically, we develop alongside Frederick Treeves, played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by Anthony Hopkins. Next to Treeves we pity Merrick, respect him, pity him again, and then ask ourselves with him, 'is he just a spectacle to me? Am I a bad person?'\n\nLynch certainly doesn't let us bypass this question easily. Are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? Certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets John, and we are not excluded. However, as with almost every character who truly comes to know John and confer with him, we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. Nonetheless, this issue never finds close in the film, nor do I feel it ever can be closed in actual life. Hopkin's Treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma, and so, neither can we be.\n\nTechnically, The Elephant Man is a beautifully shot film. In crisp black and white, the film recalls the cinematic technique of American cinema circa the 1930's. The scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. The lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes, balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. The one digression from this form are the distinctly Lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. These are, for the most part, fairly intimidating sidenotes. We as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with Treeves, we are put instead into Merrick's shoes. It is unsettling.\n\nBut Lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. We must watch Merrick beaten, abused, harassed, humiliated, and tormented. We may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself, but by that point we still have to cope with what we've already, what he's already, experienced. I suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. Every moment is heartbreaking. Yet no matter how hard it gets, and how much better it then turns, there is always the threat of another jab. And those jabs only get more and more painful.\n\nThe Elephant Man is a perfect film. It is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. It is a film about where our empathy stems from, a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. It asks you to respect Merrick, not cry for him. But you can't help crying. The Elephant Man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. It asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane.

One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one's sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), 'The Elephant Man,' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. There he is. And it's no big deal.\n            </Content>\n        </Review>\n    </UserReview>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\n### Explanation\n- Each relevant segment of the article has been wrapped in XML tags corresponding to the attributes defined in the ADT.\n- The **Name**, **Genre**, **Emotional Impact**, **Themes**, **Complexity Level**, **Director**, **Release Year**, and **Additional Information** are clearly defined.\n- Additional sections like **Synopsis**, **Trivia**, **Quotes**, and **User Review** are included to provide a comprehensive view of the movie while maintaining the structure and readability of the content.",

            "content": "Images courtesy of Pixar\n\n# One billion assets: How Pixar’s Lightspeed team tackled Coco’s complexity\n\nSince its breakthrough work on Toy Story more than 22 years ago, Disney’s Pixar has been a mainstay and leading light in the world of CGI. Producing blockbuster after blockbuster, the California-based studio has consistently redefined and pushed the boundaries of computer animation. One such success was Coco, Pixar’s 2017 tale of a boy’s journey into the fictional Land of the Dead. The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and Best Animated Film at the BAFTAs.\n\nFoundry spoke to Renee Tam, Lightspeed Lead at Pixar Animation Studios, about Coco’s complexity — and how her team overcame these challenges to deliver a critically acclaimed animated movie.\n\nTell us about Pixar’s Lightspeed team — what’s its role and how long have you been involved?\n\nRenee Tam (RT): “I’ve been at Pixar for around 12 years, and have been on the Lightspeed team since we created Brave (released in 2012). Quite a lot of people, even internally, don’t really know what we do — but we’re basically a global team solving technical problems regarding lighting.\n\n“Sometimes we’ll be researching and developing new tools, or dealing with the performance of the show — usually focusing on the end of the pipeline, but also helping upstream as much as we can, for efficiency and optimisation.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhy was Coco such a complex project?\n\nRT: “We had a tonne of lights — the most we’ve ever had, in fact. There were 8.7 million lights, 27 million objects and 200 million shading points, with 1 billion file assets.\n\n“One of my team’s key responsibilities is to look at how we make all of this work for the artists on these projects — we want them to be able to focus on the art, not the technicalities.\n\n“Coco was especially complex as the movie has two completely separate worlds —t he Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead. Usually, you have one giant setting for the whole movie; one set of characters. It makes optimisation more straightforward.\n\n“But, with Coco, there was two of everything. Miguel, the main character, even had three iterations — one living, one dead, and one in transition. And we had things like the Marigold Bridge that were intricate and needed a lot of attention to detail.\n\n“There were a lot of new things we’d never seen or done before — the towers in the Land of the Dead, for example. The ones you see in the background are completely modelled, not just painted. You can literally fly the camera around the scene and zoom in and out and see all the intricate detail. Technically, it was very ambitious.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow did that impact Lightspeed’s work?\n\nRT: “One of the biggest challenges was making the whole thing processable through our current CPU and memory. When we first started rendering, we just let the computer run to see how long it would take, and it was taking 1,000 hours per frame for the towers. That’s something like 3,000 years of computer cycles to finish the render, so 70 years to render the movie.\n\n“We managed to fix a few bugs and get it down to 450 hours per frame, which was a big milestone. We also figured out a smart way to split the foreground and the background, so memory could be lowered.\n\n“Then we decided to bake the lighting for some of the towers in the background. But you can only bake from one fixed camera point of view, so you lose parallax as the scene moves. That was a problem because there are a lot of scenic shots in the movie and your eyes are smart, so you could tell if they were baked.\n\n“Instead, I decided I wanted to do a 360-degree bake. Each tower was baked every 20 degrees on latitude and longitude — there are these trains flying around the towers, and you’ll see if you pay close attention that the train is following the track and the track is baked into the tower.\n\n“In the end we got the render time down to 55 hours per frame with quite a few more bug fixes. We had a similar issue with Hector’s skeleton — the shading started out at 125 hours per frame, but we did a lot of work on optimisation and baking out what we could, and got that down to 30 hours.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat were the most important lessons you learned throughout the process?\n\nRT: “Always look to a simpler workflow. Baking is something we’re always pushing not to do — we want to push the hardware and software to its limit — but at a point you have to think backwards, to see the past experiences we can learn from. It can be a hard battle to fight, but there are lots of tricks from the past we can still use today.\n\n“It’s also important to have a better sense of what’s coming down the line — on Coco, we initially didn’t think the skeleton shading and the Marigold Bridge were going to be too difficult. I’m trying to do more communicating to other departments upstream.\n\n“Teamwork, too, is vital — and something I have had to learn. The larger the team, the harder it is to manage. It’s my job to make sure everyone has interesting work to do, and to balance that with some of the less exciting jobs is hard.\n\n“But, despite all the complexities, Coco was one of the easiest, most enjoyable movies I’ve worked on — because of the team dynamic. From the Supe Tech, the DP, all department supes, the lighting leads, and Lightspeed team has been fantastic. I'm very lucky that I get to work with the people I do.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReady to add Katana to your pipeline?

Writing and creativity are dead. At least, they soon will be according to some critics responding to the recent and rapid advances of OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nArtificial intelligence laboratory OpenAI, which boasts Elon Musk as one of its initial investors, made waves with the launch of its text-generating chatbot late last year. The core function of ChatGPT is to mimic human conversation, but it can also write and debug computer programs, write essays, answer test questions, and compose music, lyrics, and poetry. And it’s also completely free to the public (at least for now). The intent, it seems, is to revolutionize our understanding of human creativity and the transmission of knowledge.\n\nWith the ability of advanced chat bots to mimic human creativity and style (and to effectively do the ‘thinking’ for you), many are now understandably wondering about its repercussions for society, culture, writing, academia, and technology.\n\nTo put it to the test, I asked ChatGPT to write me an essay about masculinity in Hemingway’s novels. Within thirty seconds, I had a competent and painless-to-read essay. If a student were to turn this essay in, I could not reasonably mark them down based on content, nor could I find many flaws in their application of sentence structure, organization, language, or grammar. ChatGPT was able to mimic the knowledge as well as the writing skill of an average to above average college student.\n\nSo on one side of the battle seem to stand those who see OpenAI as a tool—”if it can help me communicate more efficiently and effectively, why shouldn’t I use it?” On the other side are those who question the ethical and humanistic impact of such technology— “do we as humans want to be intelligent or simply use machines that can pass for or mimic human intelligence?” As with most dilemmas, the solution will likely be found somewhere in the middle, and I look forward to scientists and engineers being forced to work with language and literary experts in what is sure to be a perfect storm of intellectual, ethical, and technological vortexes. In other words, the scientific and existential worlds will finally have to work together in order to move forward.\n\nThe lines between ethics, technology, and humanity become similarly blurred in Kogonada’s 2021 film After Yang. Parents Jake (Collin Farrell) and Kyra (Jodie Turner-Smith) find themselves faced with a difficult decision. Yang (Justin Min), the robotic child they purchased from a reseller for their adoptive daughter Mika (Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja), has begun to malfunction. If Jake doesn’t get him repaired, Yang will decompose. This will surely upset Mika, who has begun to genuinely see Yang as a sibling and part of the family—they even do family dance competitions together (as evidenced by one of the best title sequences in recent memory).\n\nIt’s no wonder, then, that the name of the reseller that Jake must track down in order to repair Yang is “Second Siblings.” (For the record, the original company is called “Brothers &amp; Sisters,” so there is no hiding what these companies are trying to peddle.)\n\n“I don’t want to go to school,” Mika moans. “I want to be with Yang.” Yang, after all, has become her confidant and emotional support, and she questions what life will be like without him. It’s a question, too, that begins to reflect heavily on the audience, as we see Yang’s essential role within the family. At what point does our relationship with or reliance on technology become unhealthy or a crutch? And is technology in any way beginning to replace essential human interactions and experiences that we need to grow, function, and fully live as human beings?\n\nFor Mika and her family, Yang is more than a toy, but less than a human. He is purchased, but not disposable. He is full of life, yet not living. The idea of Yang as a living being is bound up in the memory bank discovered in his core—memory banks in “techno-sapiens” like Yang were supposed to have been discontinued due to privacy concerns and their ability to record footage without permission.\n\nAs Jake begins to explore Yang’s memories, the divide between technology and humanity continues to fray and fracture. Yang has sought out relationships outside of the family, seemingly trying to make a life for himself and discover an experience which eludes him. And Yang in many ways has replaced Mika’s reliance on her parents. So Jake and Kyra decide that, if Yang cannot be repaired, they should not purchase another techno for Mika.\n\n“We’ve been over-reliant on him,” Kyra says. “We bought Yang to connect Mika to her Chinese heritage, not to raise her.” Somehow the idea of buying another sibling for Mika is strange, but the real curiosity for the audience is found in the ease with which Yang himself is not considered strange, how quickly he becomes embedded in the family, and how seamlessly he seems to establish genuine and intimate human connections.\n\nOne such connection comes over a conversation about tea. Yang quizzes Jake, who runs a tea shop, about why he has dedicated his life to the selling of tea. The story that Jake tells Yang says as much about Kogonada’s view of the importance of film as it does about tea. However, Yang understands that he cannot grasp certain realities the way humans can.\n\n“I wish I felt something deeper about tea,” he tells Jake. There is something forlorn in the way Yang expresses this desire. It is not a mechanical fact, something that simply isn’t possible for him. Rather, there is something in his design that makes him wish not to function simply according to his programming but to actually experience what it is to be human.\n\nThough it is never said aloud, one wonders if Jake suspects Yang of being more human than the humans (Jake included) who rely so heavily and without a second thought on technology.\n\nIn its greatest moments, After Yang forces the audience to grapple with that same question: what does it mean to be human? Perhaps it’s a question that humanity will always grapple with, whether in a technological society or not. But how ironic would it be that, in an age when technology seems to be constantly erasing and replacing human interactions, that technology itself would force us to reengage with this existential question.\n\nAs proven by OpenAI and ChatGPT, we are only beginning to glimpse technology’s ability to imitate human intelligence and creativity. But with these new waters come new and increasingly complex questions of ethics and humanity. The question is no longer as simple as, “Is this a life, or isn’t it?”\n\nNow we must grapple with the repercussions of imitated humanity and knowledge. Google knows. ChatGPT can write. How long before genuine human thought is circumvented and outsourced? And if technology can think for me, write for me, know for me, at what point do I become less human?\n\nThe nature of humanity is no longer a scientific question alone. As is the case in After Yang, it’s becoming, once again, an increasingly existential one. What happens after, we will see.\n\nAfter Yang is written, directed, and edited by Kogonada. The story is adapted from Alexander Weinstein’s short story, “Saying Goodbye to Yang,” and has an MPAA rating of PG for some thematic elements and language.\n\nJustin Petrisek is a writer from Virginia. He received his M.F.A. in creative writing and M.A. in literature from George Mason University as well as an M.A. in theology from the Augustine Institute.\n\n- Release Date: 2021\n- Genre: \n                                    Sci-Fi, Drama\n- Rating: PG\n\n#### Latest Movies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Get Notifications\n\nSign up to receive email updates from Charlotte Lozier Institute.\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nΔ\n\n- About Us\n- Our Team\n- In The News\n- Press Releases\n- Contact Us\n\n- Categories\n- Latest Research\n- Abortion\n- Abortion Drugs\n- Fetal Development\n- Fetal Tissue, Stem Cells &amp;amp; Bioethics\n- Maternal &amp;amp; Public Health\n- End of Life\n- Life &amp;amp; the Law\n\n- Publication Types\n- American Reports Series\n- On Point\n- On Science\n- On Women’s Health\n- Peer Reviewed &amp;amp; Journal\n- Press Releases\n- State Abortion Reports\n\n- Research Types\n- Articles\n- Commentary\n- Fact Sheets\n- Legal Briefs\n- Maps\n- Peer Reviewed\n- Policy Papers\n- Polls\n- Scholar Q&amp;amp;A\n- Testimony\n\n© Copyright Charlotte Lozier Institute 2025\n\n<!-- image -->",

It stars Awkwafina, Tzi Ma, Diana Lin, and Zhao Shuzhen. The film follows a Chinese American woman named Billi, who learns her grandmother (referred to as Nai Nai) has only a short while left to live. Billi's family has decided to schedule a family wedding before Nai Nai dies to enable her to see all the family one last time and not tell Nai Nai of her fatal illness.\n\nThe film is based in part on director Wang's life experiences, which she first publicly discussed as part of her radio story \"What You Don't Know\", which appeared as part of an episode of This American Life.\n\nThe Farewell premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12 by A24. It received widespread acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Wang's screenplay and the performances of Awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards the film was nominated for two awards including Best Foreign Language Film, with Awkwafina winning for Best Actress. The Farewell has dialogue in both English and Mandarin Chinese.\n\n## Plot\n\nAspiring Chinese-American writer Billi maintains a close relationship with her Nai Nai (paternal grandmother) who lives in Changchun, China. After receiving a rejection letter for a Guggenheim Fellowship, she discovers from her parents, Haiyan and Jian, that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and is predicted to have only a few months left to live.\n\nThrough deception and manipulation of medical test results, the diagnosis is kept a secret from Nai Nai herself. She is, instead, falsely told that her recent doctor visits have only revealed benign findings. A wedding for Billi's cousin from Japan, Hao Hao, has been planned in China as an excuse to unite the family to spend what is expected to be one last time with Nai Nai. Fearing Billi will end up exposing the lie to her grandmother, Haiyan and Jian tell her to remain in New York City.\n\nBilli disobeys her parents' orders and flies to Changchun shortly after the rest of the family arrive. She assures her parents that she will not reveal the cancer diagnosis to Nai Nai. Throughout the trip, however, she clashes with the rest of the family over their deliberate dishonesty towards her grandmother. Guilt-ridden, Billi expresses conflicted thoughts with her parents over the Chinese cultural beliefs that result in a family refusing to disclose a life-threatening disease, including the trauma of her grandfather passing away without her knowledge after they moved to the United States.\n\nOne night, her uncle, Haibin, contends that the lie allows the family to bear the emotional burden of the diagnosis, rather than Nai Nai herself—a practice of collectivism that he acknowledges differs from the individualistic values common in Western culture. Billi later learns that Nai Nai also told a similar lie to her husband up until his death when he was terminally ill.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, both Haibin and Hao Hao break down in tears on separate occasions but manage to proceed through the banquet without raising Nai Nai's suspicions. Billi intercepts Nai Nai's medical test results from the hospital and has it altered to reflect a clean bill of health, helping to maintain the lie.\n\nThat night, Nai Nai gives Billi a hóngbāo, encouraging her to spend the money as she chooses. Billi admits that she wants to stay in Changchun to spend more time with Nai Nai, but Nai Nai declines, telling her that she needs to live her own life. When Billi reveals the Guggenheim Fellowship rejection to her, Nai Nai encourages Billi to keep an open mind and not get hung up on this failure, \"don't be the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room.\" She says that \"life is not about what things one does, but more so about how one goes about doing them\".\n\nBilli keeps her promise to maintain the lie. She shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai as the visiting family members return to their homes in Japan and America. A title card reveals that six years after her diagnosis, the woman Nai Nai's character was based on is still alive and still unaware of her sickness.[3]\n\n## Cast\n\n- Awkwafina as Billi Wang\n- Tzi Ma as Haiyan Wang, Billi's father\n- Diana Lin as Lu Jian, Billi's mother\n- Zhao Shu-zhen as Nai Nai, Billi's paternal grandmother\n- Lu Hong (playing herself) as Little Nai Nai, Billi's grandmother's younger sister\n- Jiang Yongbo as Haibin, Haiyan's older brother\n- Chen Han as Hao Hao, Haibin's son\n- Aoi Mizuhara as Aiko, Hao Hao's Japanese fiancée\n- Zhang Jing as Yuping, Haiyan's cousin\n- Li Xiang as Aunty Ling, Haibin's wife\n- Yang Xuejian as Mr. Li\n- Jim Liu as Dr. Song\n\n## Production\n\nLulu Wang faced obstacles when pitching her film about a Chinese American family. She says she had many disheartening encounters with American and Chinese financiers who wanted to include a \"prominent white character into the narrative and punch up the nuanced drama to turn it into a broad comedy.\"[4]\n\nWang later created an episode titled \"What You Don't Know\" for This American Life in April, 2016 based on her family's story. This caught the attention of producer Chris Weitz who helped secure financing for the film.[5][4]\n\nWang said that the film was based on her grandmother's illness, stating that \"I always felt the divide in my relationship to my family versus my relationship to my classmates and to my colleagues and to the world that I inhabit. That's just the nature of being an immigrant and straddling two cultures.\"[6]\n\nThe film was primarily shot in Changchun, China, over the course of 24 days in June 2018.[7][8] Filming also took place in New York.[9] In an interview with Filmmaker, cinematographer Anna Franquesa Solano stated that the references for the film included Force Majeure and Still Walking.[9] However, she added that her main source of inspiration came from \"spending time with Lulu's family at their home in Changchun, during pre-production.\"[9]\n\nDirector Lulu Wang says that she kept the secret from her grandmother during and after film production. It was awkward to keep the secret when the grandmother visited the filming, a block from her home. Wang claims her grandmother eventually found out when a friend sent her a review of the film.[10]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film had its premiere in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2019.[11] In January 2019, A24 acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for $7 million, over Netflix, Amazon Studios, and Fox Searchlight Pictures.[11][12] It was released in the United States on July 12, 2019.[13] A fully Chinese-subtitled version of the film played in select theaters on September 8, 2019.[14]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Farewell grossed $17.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $23.1 million,[2] against a production budget of $3 million.[1]\n\nIn its opening weekend the film made $355,662 from four theaters for an average of $88,916 per venue; at the time, it was the best average of 2019, besting Avengers: Endgame's $76,601.[15] It expanded to 35 theaters in its second weekend and earned $1.14 million,[16] then made $1.5 million from 135 theaters in its third.[17] It continued to expand in the following weeks, making $2.4 million from 426 theaters and then $2.2 million from 705 theaters.[18][19] The film expanded further to over 800 theaters in the next few weeks, $1.4 million from 861 theaters, $882,623 from 816 theaters and $841,414 from 891 theaters.[20][21]\n\nThe Farewell was a box office \"flop\" in China, grossing only $580,000 by January 2020 in what was then the world's second-largest film market.[22] According to Sixth Tone, the film's delayed theatrical release—to prevent it from being lost in the hype surrounding Disney’s Frozen 2—was a big factor in the low gross since many in China had already seen it abroad or online.[23]\n\n### Critical response\n\nAwkwafina's performance as Billi garnered widespread critical acclaim.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, with an average rating of 8.5/10, based on 345 reviews. The website's critics' consensus reads: \"The Farewell deftly captures complicated family dynamics with a poignant, well-acted drama that marries cultural specificity with universally relatable themes.\"[24] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 47 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[25] On IMDb, the film received a rating of 7.5/10, based on 73k reviews. [26]\n\nEric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an A− grade and praised Awkwafina's performance, writing, \"As a Chinese-American grappling with the traditionalism of her past and its impact on the future, she's an absorbing engine for the movie's introspective look at a most unusual family reunion.\"[27] Christy Lemire writing for RogerEbert.com gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, saying Zhao Shuzhen is \"the most frequent source of laughs\", but went on to say that \"as delightful as [Zhao] is in this crucial, central role, she will also quietly rip your heart out by the film's end\".[28]\n\nRichard Lawson of Vanity Fair wrote, \"Wang movingly tells not just a story about the negotiations of familial love, but also of the immigrant experience, of revisiting one's homeland to, in some senses, say goodbye to it.\"[29] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter commented, \"its moments of sweet sentimentality are fully earned and heartfelt.\"[30] Brian Lowry of CNN.com described it as a \"small, melancholy movie that explores cultural differences and dealing with death in an utterly charming, understated manner.\"[31] Hong Kong playwright Jingan Young commented on the film's depiction of the differences between western and Chinese family values, claiming that \"the family’s decision to tell a 'good lie' is a metaphor for the collective delusion of living under the Chinese Communist party.\"[32][33]\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n|   Year  | Award                                     | Category                              | Nominated work              |

It stars <name>Awkwafina</name>, <name>Tzi Ma</name>, <name>Diana Lin</name>, and <name>Zhao Shu-zhen</name>. The film follows a Chinese American woman named <name>Billi</name>, who learns her grandmother (referred to as Nai Nai) has only a short while left to live. Billi's family has decided to schedule a family wedding before Nai Nai dies to enable her to see all the family one last time and not tell Nai Nai of her fatal illness.\n\nThe film is based in part on director Wang's life experiences, which she first publicly discussed as part of her radio story \"What You Don't Know\", which appeared as part of an episode of This American Life.\n\nThe Farewell premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on <releaseYear>January 25, 2019</releaseYear>, and was theatrically released in the United States on <releaseYear>July 12, 2019</releaseYear> by A24. It received widespread acclaim from critics, with particular praise for Wang's screenplay and the performances of Awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for two awards including Best Foreign Language Film, with Awkwafina winning for Best Actress. The Farewell has dialogue in both English and Mandarin Chinese.\n\n## Plot\n\nAspiring Chinese-American writer <name>Billi</name> maintains a close relationship with her Nai Nai (paternal grandmother) who lives in Changchun, China. After receiving a rejection letter for a Guggenheim Fellowship, she discovers from her parents, Haiyan and Jian, that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and is predicted to have only a few months left to live.\n\nThrough deception and manipulation of medical test results, the diagnosis is kept a secret from Nai Nai herself. She is, instead, falsely told that her recent doctor visits have only revealed benign findings. A wedding for Billi's cousin from Japan, Hao Hao, has been planned in China as an excuse to unite the family to spend what is expected to be one last time with Nai Nai. Fearing Billi will end up exposing the lie to her grandmother, Haiyan and Jian tell her to remain in New York City.\n\nBilli disobeys her parents' orders and flies to Changchun shortly after the rest of the family arrive. She assures her parents that she will not reveal the cancer diagnosis to Nai Nai. Throughout the trip, however, she clashes with the rest of the family over their deliberate dishonesty towards her grandmother. Guilt-ridden, Billi expresses conflicted thoughts with her parents over the Chinese cultural beliefs that result in a family refusing to disclose a life-threatening disease, including the trauma of her grandfather passing away without her knowledge after they moved to the United States.\n\nOne night, her uncle, Haibin, contends that the lie allows the family to bear the emotional burden of the diagnosis, rather than Nai Nai herself—a practice of collectivism that he acknowledges differs from the individualistic values common in Western culture. Billi later learns that Nai Nai also told a similar lie to her husband up until his death when he was terminally ill.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, both Haibin and Hao Hao break down in tears on separate occasions but manage to proceed through the banquet without raising Nai Nai's suspicions. Billi intercepts Nai Nai's medical test results from the hospital and has it altered to reflect a clean bill of health, helping to maintain the lie.\n\nThat night, Nai Nai gives Billi a hóngbāo, encouraging her to spend the money as she chooses. Billi admits that she wants to stay in Changchun to spend more time with Nai Nai, but Nai Nai declines, telling her that she needs to live her own life. When Billi reveals the Guggenheim Fellowship rejection to her, Nai Nai encourages Billi to keep an open mind and not get hung up on this failure, \"don't be the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room.\" She says that \"life is not about what things one does, but more so about how one goes about doing them\".\n\nBilli keeps her promise to maintain the lie. She shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai as the visiting family members return to their homes in Japan and America. A title card reveals that six years after her diagnosis, the woman Nai Nai's character was based on is still alive and still unaware of her sickness.\n\n## Cast\n\n- <name>Awkwafina</name> as Billi Wang\n- <name>Tzi Ma</name> as Haiyan Wang, Billi's father\n- <name>Diana Lin</name> as Lu Jian, Billi's mother\n- <name>Zhao Shu-zhen</name> as Nai Nai, Billi's paternal grandmother\n- Lu Hong (playing herself) as Little Nai Nai, Billi's grandmother's younger sister\n- Jiang Yongbo as Haibin, Haiyan's older brother\n- Chen Han as Hao Hao, Haibin's son\n- Aoi Mizuhara as Aiko, Hao Hao's Japanese fiancée\n- Zhang Jing as Yuping, Haiyan's cousin\n- Li Xiang as Aunty Ling, Haibin's wife\n- Yang Xuejian as Mr. Li\n- Jim Liu as Dr. Song\n\n## Production\n\nLulu Wang faced obstacles when pitching her film about a Chinese American family. She says she had many disheartening encounters with American and Chinese financiers who wanted to include a \"prominent white character into the narrative and punch up the nuanced drama to turn it into a broad comedy.\"\n\nWang later created an episode titled \"What You Don't Know\" for This American Life in April, 2016 based on her family's story. This caught the attention of producer Chris Weitz who helped secure financing for the film.\n\nWang said that the film was based on her grandmother's illness, stating that \"I always felt the divide in my relationship to my family versus my relationship to my classmates and to my colleagues and to the world that I inhabit. That's just the nature of being an immigrant and straddling two cultures.\"\n\nThe film was primarily shot in Changchun, China, over the course of 24 days in June 2018. Filming also took place in New York. In an interview with Filmmaker, cinematographer Anna Franquesa Solano stated that the references for the film included Force Majeure and Still Walking. However, she added that her main source of inspiration came from \"spending time with Lulu's family at their home in Changchun, during pre-production.\"\n\nDirector Lulu Wang says that she kept the secret from her grandmother during and after film production. It was awkward to keep the secret when the grandmother visited the filming, a block from her home. Wang claims her grandmother eventually found out when a friend sent her a review of the film.\n\n## Release\n\nThe film had its premiere in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on <releaseYear>January 25, 2019</releaseYear>. In January 2019, A24 acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film for $7 million, over Netflix, Amazon Studios, and Fox Searchlight Pictures. It was released in the United States on <releaseYear>July 12, 2019</releaseYear>. A fully Chinese-subtitled version of the film played in select theaters on September 8, 2019.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Farewell grossed $17.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $5.4 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $23.1 million, against a production budget of $3 million.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film made $355,662 from four theaters for an average of $88,916 per venue; at the time, it was the best average of 2019, besting Avengers: Endgame's $76,601. It expanded to 35 theaters in its second weekend and earned $1.14 million, then made $1.5 million from 135 theaters in its third. It continued to expand in the following weeks, making $2.4 million from 426 theaters and then $2.2 million from 705 theaters.\n\nThe Farewell was a box office \"flop\" in China, grossing only $580,000 by January 2020 in what was then the world's second-largest film market. According to Sixth Tone, the film's delayed theatrical release—to prevent it from being lost in the hype surrounding Disney’s Frozen 2—was a big factor in the low gross since many in China had already seen it abroad or online.\n\n### Critical response\n\nAwkwafina's performance as Billi garnered widespread critical acclaim.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, with an average rating of 8.5/10, based on 345 reviews. The website's critics' consensus reads: \"The Farewell deftly captures complicated family dynamics with a poignant, well-acted drama that marries cultural specificity with universally relatable themes.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 47 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". On IMDb, the film received a rating of 7.5/10, based on 73k reviews.\n\nEric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an A− grade and praised Awkwafina's performance, writing, \"As a Chinese-American grappling with the traditionalism of her past and its impact on the future, she's an absorbing engine for the movie's introspective look at a most unusual family reunion.\" Christy Lemire writing for RogerEbert.com gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, saying Zhao Shuzhen is \"the most frequent source of laughs\", but went on to say that \"as delightful as [Zhao] is in this crucial, central role, she will also quietly rip your heart out by the film's end.\"\n\nRichard Lawson of Vanity Fair wrote, \"Wang movingly tells not just a story about the negotiations of familial love, but also of the immigrant experience, of revisiting one's homeland to, in some senses, say goodbye to it.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter commented, \"its moments of sweet sentimentality are fully earned and heartfelt.\" Brian Lowry of CNN.com described it as a \"small, melancholy movie that explores cultural differences and dealing with death in an utterly charming, understated manner.\" Hong Kong playwright Jingan Young commented on the film's depiction of the differences between western and Chinese family values, claiming that \"the family’s decision to tell a 'good lie' is a metaphor for the collective delusion of living under the Chinese Communist party.\"\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n| Year | Award | Category | Nominated work | Result

Filmed in CinemaScope, it was distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is considered among the most romantic films of all time according to the American Film Institute.[4] The film was a remake of McCarey's 1939 film Love Affair, starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer.\n\n## Plot\n\nNickie Ferrante, a well-known playboy, meets Terry McKay aboard the transatlantic ocean liner SS Constitution en route from Europe to New York. Each is romantically involved with someone else. After a series of meetings aboard the ship, they establish a friendship. When Terry joins Nickie on a brief visit to his grandmother Janou while the ship is anchored near her home at Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean coast, she sees Nickie with new eyes and their feelings become deeper. During their visit, Janou tells Terry that Nickie is a talented painter but destroys most of his paintings because they don't meet his standards. As the ship returns to New York City, they agree to reunite at the top of the Empire State Building in six months' time if they have succeeded in ending their relationships and starting new careers.\n\nOn the day of their rendezvous, Terry, hurrying to reach the Empire State Building, is struck down by a car while crossing a street. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, Nickie, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident and, after many hours, leaves at midnight, believing that she has rejected him.\n\nAfter the accident, Terry, now unable to walk, refuses to contact Nickie because of her disability. Instead, she finds work as a music teacher. Nickie has pursued his painting and has his work displayed by Courbet, an art gallery owner. Six months after the accident, Terry sees Nickie with his former fiancée at the ballet. Nickie does not notice her condition because she is seated, and they both say hello.\n\nNickie learns Terry's address and on Christmas Eve pays her a surprise visit. Although he tries to coax her to explain her actions, Terry dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she lies. He gives Terry a shawl that Janou, who has died, left for her. As he is leaving, Nickie mentions a painting on which he had been working when they first met, and that it was just given away to a woman who liked it but had no money. He is about to say that the woman was in a wheelchair when he pauses, suddenly suspecting why Terry has been lying still on the couch. He walks into her bedroom and sees the painting hanging on the wall, realizing that she was the woman in the wheelchair. The film ends with the two in a tight embrace as Terry says, \"If you can paint, I can walk. Anything can happen, don't you think?\"\n\n## Cast\n\n- Cary Grant as Nickie Ferrante\n- Deborah Kerr as Terry McKay\n- Richard Denning as Kenneth Bradley\n- Neva Patterson as Lois Clark\n- Cathleen Nesbitt as Janou (Nickie's grandmother)\n- Robert Q. Lewis as himself (announcer)\n- Charles Watts as Ned Hathaway\n- Fortunio Bonanova as Courbet\n- Marni Nixon as Terry McKay's singing voice\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was a remake of McCarey's 1939 film Love Affair, starring Irene Dunne as Terry and Charles Boyer as the Gallic playboy Michel Marnet. Plans for a Love Affair remake were first reported in 1952, which had Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl attached to the project.[5]\n\nCary Grant first worked with McCarey on The Awful Truth and did not like McCarey's improvisational strategy, but after eventually warming to it, he wished that he had starred in Love Affair, and he often visited the set during production.[6] He enjoyed the film when it was released and convinced McCarey years later to remake it starring Grant in Boyer's role.[7] McCarey later commented: \"Hollywood films all seem to be trying to find a trick way of saying 'I love you.' What are they trying to prove? Love is the oldest and noblest emotion.\"[8] An Affair to Remember was almost identical to the original on a scene-to-scene basis.[6][9] McCarey used the same screenplay as was employed for the original film, written by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart,[10] but Stewart was not included in the credits because he had been blacklisted. Filming took place between February and April 1957.[11]\n\nGrant was reportedly grumpy during filming because his hypnotherapy with his wife caused him to dislike smoking.[11] He also underwent an operation during production to treat a lump on his forehead that resulted from a childhood injury.[11]\n\nThe theme song \"An Affair to Remember (Our Love Affair),\" composed by Harry Warren and with lyrics by Leo McCarey and Harold Adamson, was sung by Vic Damone over the opening credits and by Marni Nixon (who dubbed Kerr)[11] during the film.\n\n## Songs\n\n- An Affair to Remember (Our Love Affair) sung by Vic Damone\n- \"Continué,\" sung by Marni Nixon (dubbing for Deborah Kerr)\n- \"The Tiny Scout (He Knows You Inside Out)\" sung by Marni Nixon (dubbing for Deborah Kerr)\n- \"Tomorrow Land\" sung by Marni Nixon (dubbing for Deborah Kerr)\n- \"You Make It Easy to Be True\"\n\nAll of the above;\n\n- Music by Harry Warren\n- Lyrics by Harold Adamson and Leo McCarey[12]\n\n## Novelization\n\nIn anticipation of the film's release, Avon Books published a paperback novelization of the screenplay. The byline Owen Aherne was a pseudonym for American novelist R.V. Cassill.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reaction\n\nBosley Crowther of The New York Times found the early part of the film fairly enjoyable, with \"plenty of humorous conversation that is handled crisply\" by the leads, but concluded that the picture goes wrong after the couple disembarks, writing: \"The marriage pact seems ridiculously childish for a couple of adult people to make. The lady's failure to notify her fiancé of her accident seems absurd. The fact that the man does not hear of it in some way is beyond belief. And the slowness with which he grasps the obvious when he calls upon the lady is just too thick.\"[13] Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post agreed, writing that the film \"boasts early amusing reels that ultimately become unbelievably foolish in the quest for audience tears.\"[14] Variety disagreed, calling the romance \"never maudlin\" and \"wholly believable\" in a positive review of what it called \"a winning film\" with \"all the ingredients that should make it an ideal women's picture.\"[15] Harrison's Reports was also positive, calling it \"more enchanting and delightful than the original\" and \"so powerful in the closing scenes that one is unable to fight back the tears.\"[16] John McCarten of The New Yorker was dismissive, writing that the actors were \"tolerable, but the movie is really awfully maudlin.\"[17] A generally positive review in The Monthly Film Bulletin called the film \"a lush slice of Hollywood romanticism, unashamedly following most of the familiar conventions of glossy magazine fiction. To judge it on a higher level would normally seem unfair if it were not that here the script does succeed in cutting rather deeper. The relationship between Ferrante and Terry McKay is briskly developed, with an attractive, often touching humor.\"[18] The Philadelphia Inquirer review invoked the 1939 original: \"18 years ago we wept and worried over the romantic pangs of Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer in 'Love Affair.' It seems distinctly unimportant now when misunderstandings disrupt the billing and cooing of Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant in 'An Affair to Remember,' Leo McCarey's interminably extended version of 'Love Affair'.\"[19]\n\nThe film holds a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.[20] In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.[21] It is one of the BFI's \"50 great Christmas films currently streaming\".[22]\n\n## Accolades\n\n| Award                                 | Category                                                | Nominee(s)                                                                                  | Result    |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards[23]                    | Best Cinematography                                     | Milton Krasner                                                                              | Nominated |\n| Academy Awards[23]                    | Best Costume Design                                     | Charles LeMaire                                                                             | Nominated |\n| Academy Awards[23]                    | Best Scoring                                            | Hugo Friedhofer                                                                             | Nominated |\n| Academy Awards[23]                    | Best Song                                               | \"An Affair to Remember\"   Music by Harry Warren;   Lyrics by Leo McCarey and Harold Adamson | Nominated |\n| Boxoffice Magazine Awards             | Best Picture of the Month for the Whole Family (August) | Leo McCarey                                                                                 | Won       |\n| Directors Guild of America Awards[24] | Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures  | Leo McCarey                                                                                 | Nominated |\n| Laurel Awards                         | Top Music Composer                                      | Hugo Friedhofer                                                                             | 5th Place |\n| Photoplay Awards                      | Gold Medal                                              | Gold Medal                                                                                  | Won       |\n\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions – #5[4]\n\n## Legacy\n\n- Nora Ephron's 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, was partly inspired by An Affair to Remember, particularly the ending.

Each is romantically involved with someone else. After a series of meetings aboard the ship, they establish a friendship. When Terry joins Nickie on a brief visit to his grandmother Janou while the ship is anchored near her home at Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean coast, she sees Nickie with new eyes and their feelings become deeper. During their visit, Janou tells Terry that Nickie is a talented painter but destroys most of his paintings because they don't meet his standards. As the ship returns to New York City, they agree to reunite at the top of the Empire State Building in six months' time if they have succeeded in ending their relationships and starting new careers.\n\n        On the day of their rendezvous, Terry, hurrying to reach the Empire State Building, is struck down by a car while crossing a street. Gravely injured, she is rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, Nickie, waiting for her at the observation deck at the top of the building, is unaware of the accident and, after many hours, leaves at midnight, believing that she has rejected him.\n\n        After the accident, Terry, now unable to walk, refuses to contact Nickie because of her disability. Instead, she finds work as a music teacher. Nickie has pursued his painting and has his work displayed by Courbet, an art gallery owner. Six months after the accident, Terry sees Nickie with his former fiancée at the ballet. Nickie does not notice her condition because she is seated, and they both say hello.\n\n        Nickie learns Terry's address and on Christmas Eve pays her a surprise visit. Although he tries to coax her to explain her actions, Terry dodges the subject, never leaving the couch on which she lies. He gives Terry a shawl that Janou, who has died, left for her. As he is leaving, Nickie mentions a painting on which he had been working when they first met, and that it was just given away to a woman who liked it but had no money. He is about to say that the woman was in a wheelchair when he pauses, suddenly suspecting why Terry has been lying still on the couch. He walks into her bedroom and sees the painting hanging on the wall, realizing that she was the woman in the wheelchair. The film ends with the two in a tight embrace as Terry says, \"If you can paint, I can walk. Anything can happen, don't you think?\"\n    </Plot>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information about \"An Affair to Remember\" according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains coherent and informative while highlighting key details with XML tags.",

Drawing on phenomenological and cognitivist approaches, I explore the idea of historical mood in movies, examining how it becomes manifest in different kinds of films: those which articulate explicit historical forms of sensibility as part of their fictional world; genre films which evoke historically particular kinds of mood in creating generically distinctive cinematic worlds; and films that implicitly express moods that can be recognised retrospectively as expressing the cultural–historical sensibilities of their milieu. Extending the concept of cinematic mood to encompass its cultural and historical aspects, I argue, can enrich our understanding of the interplay between emotional engagement, aesthetic expression and trans-historical experience in narrative film.\n\nWe do not experience our belonging to history as knowledge but first as “a sensation [Empfindung], a feeling”. [1]\n\nThis essay explores the concept of historical mood as it is captured in narrative film, and considers its value for film studies and philosophy of film. Although theoretical discussions of spectator engagement within film theory continue to emphasise the notions of emotion and affect, the topic of mood has recently attracted interest from theorists concerned with understanding how emotional engagement is elicited in response to narrative film. [2]  Drawing on phenomenological and cognitivist approaches, most theorists approach mood either as a subjective phenomenon, expressing the spectator’s affective response to a film, or as an aesthetic element, expressive of a film’s artistic qualities. Mood, however, is not confined to subjective or aesthetic forms of expression; rather, it can also disclose historical and cultural dimensions of memory, experience and time, both explicitly and implicitly. This was acknowledged within German Romanticism and romantic hermeneutics, both of which articulated the relationship between aesthetic-emotional experience and historical understanding in a way that is ripe for exploration in relation to cinematic experience. [3]\n\nIn what follows I explore the idea of historical mood in movies, examining how it becomes manifest in different kinds of films: those with historical settings which articulate explicit historical forms of sensibility as part of their fictional world; genre films which evoke historically particular kinds of mood in creating generically distinctive kinds of cinematic world with their own aesthetic features (melodrama, westerns, film noir, and so on); and films that implicitly express moods that can be recognised retrospectively as expressing the cultural-historical sensibilities of their milieu. Extending the concept of cinematic mood to encompass its cultural and historical aspects, I argue, can enrich current theoretical frameworks for understanding the interplay between emotional engagement, aesthetic expression, and trans-historical experience within and through narrative film.\n\nThe study of emotional engagement with film has become one of the most intensive areas of research in film theory over the last three decades. [4]  Drawing on both phenomenological and cognitivist perspectives, film theorists have developed detailed accounts of the role of emotional engagement in cinema and the manner in which narrative film both elicits and expresses affective and emotional states. [5]  This focus on emotion was introduced by analytic and cognitivist film theorists, who applied theories drawn from analytic aesthetics and cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology, to the study of emotional responses to narrative film. [6]  Within ‘Continental’ film theory, encompassing both phenomenological and Deleuzian approaches, the concept of ‘affect’ has become central, a development that also links up with accounts of the embodied character of cinematic experience. [7]  Indeed, one can talk today of an ‘affective turn’ in film theory, drawing on varied approaches that explore different ways of articulating the embodied-affective and emotional-cognitive aspects of our engagement with cinema.\n\nGiven this focus on affect and emotion, however, it is curious that the concept of mood has been ignored. Although acknowledged as a key dimension of film genre (by using mood terms to describe certain genres), mood remains an under-theorised concept in prevailing accounts of cinematic emotional engagement. Despite this theoretical neglect, it is a phenomenon that remains essential, I contend, for understanding narrative film, especially for achieving the successful composition of a cinematic world, including historically distant or past (cultural or fictional) worlds.\n\nWhy has the study of mood been neglected? There are three reasons I would offer. The first is that mood is difficult to define and phenomenologically opaque. The question of definition is a fraught one, but mood in general can be distinguished from emotion in being more sustained, diffuse, and lacking a determinate intentional object; it is not necessarily linked with action (moods prime us, rather, for particular cognitive and emotional responses). [8]  It is more difficult, therefore, to define moods precisely, just as it is more difficult to distinguish the background affective orientation or ‘attunement’ that constitutes a mood from the specific episodic emotional states that might be related to it (a background mood of melancholy, for example, versus a specific episode of sadness).\n\nA second reason is that mood is traditionally understood either as a ‘subjective’ experience (and so not readily amenable to analysis via aesthetic theory), or else as an expressive-aesthetic aspect of a work of art (and so not obviously part of psychological or philosophical inquiry). It is common to speak of ‘being in a mood’ to describe someone in the grip of an affective state, where this is understood to reflect a subjective orientation or attitude. Such an understanding of ‘mood’ removes it from the domain of subjective experiences that typically feature in theoretical analyses of aesthetic response and aesthetic judgment. Alternatively, where mood is understood as an aesthetically relevant expressive feature of a work, it is then regarded without particular relevance to psychological or philosophical inquiry. Consequently, on both ‘subjectivist’ and ‘expressive-aesthetic’ views, mood tends to be overlooked in the analysis of aesthetic experience or for developing philosophical theories of mind.\n\nFinally, mood is ordinarily tacitly experienced (rather than explicitly thematised) in our engagement with narrative film; or when it is made explicit, it tends to be subsumed under aesthetic categories as an expressive-aesthetic feature of a work. Mood offers a sustained, diffuse, affectively charged background attunement that orients or ‘biases’ the viewer towards particular (intended) emotional and/or cognitive responses. A horror movie, for example, has to evoke specific moods (suspense, anxiety, dread) in order for the intended forms of affective and emotional responsiveness (involving shock and surprise, or fear and terror) to be solicited and sustained. Mood is not ordinarily an ‘object’ of explicit reflective awareness let alone thematic reflection (though in certain kinds of art film that is precisely how mood is intended to function). Yet if the appropriate forms of mood fail to be solicited, the result is typically a breakdown in the credibility or plausibility of the cinematic world, and hence a failure to maintain intended forms of emotional engagement. A bad horror movie, for example, is not frightening or shocking but comic or ridiculous. Without the successful solicitation of mood, the cinematic world of the horror movie loses what we might call cognitive credibility or affective plausibility. Subsequent attempts to provoke fear or horror fall flat and are experienced at a more reflective level as objects of detached commentary or deliberate mockery (through irony or humour, for example). On the other hand, when mood is made explicitly thematic (and not just confined to a tacitly experienced element of ‘background setting’ or world-building), it is readily subsumed under certain aesthetic categories; thus, for example, the ‘mood’ elements of German expressionist film, evoked using visual contrasts, light and shadow, ambiguous atmosphere, striking visual or aural (musical) effects, are grasped as aesthetic features of a cinematic style and so are not taken as objects of inquiry in their own right.\n\nAs a consequence of these issues, there are few developed theories of mood (whether phenomenological or cognitivist) to be found within the history of film theory. With the exception of certain early film theorists, especially those responding to German Expressionist film (Lotte Eisner, for example), theories of affect and emotion continue to dominate theoretical discussion of our experience of narrative film. This is unfortunate since mood remains an essential, if poorly understood, feature of our subjective experience of film, but also of the successful aesthetic composition of a (typically fictional) cinematic world, without which both our subjective engagement and aesthetic appreciation of a film would be diminished or impaired.\n\nAlthough still a matter of debate, moods can be distinguished from emotions in a number of ways. Here I identify five features that distinguish moods from emotions, and which have particular significance for the composition and reception of narrative film.\n\n1) As remarked, they can be distinguished by their non-intentional character: moods lack a determinate or specific intentional object – in the phenomenological sense of an object towards which consciousness is ‘directed’ – as distinct from emotions that typically have an identifiable intentional object (for example, my fear of a speeding car or of losing my job).\n\n2) Moods can be distinguished by their capacity to orient or ‘bias’ viewers towards certain emotional and/or cognitive responses (when feeling anxious, for example, I am more likely to perceive objects as disturbing or threatening than would otherwise be the case).\n\n3) Moods have a more diffuse causality compared with emotions: they have causes (to do with our environment or our subjective state) rather than reasons (that could be offered as motivating or explaining the source and significance of our response).\n\n4) Moods are more temporally extended than emotions, which usually are briefer, discrete episodes.\n\n5) Moods can be defined by their ‘world-revealing’ quality: they provide an affective ‘colouring’ that orients our cognitive, emotional, and practical engagement with the world, opening up or closing off spheres of meaning and of possible action. Elements of my environment can show up as affectively charged or cognitively salient thanks to the background mood that orients my practical engagement with the world. This feature is important for narrative film: mood is a necessary feature of the composition of a plausible cinematic world in which emotional engagement can successfully occur (or fail to occur).\n\nA common conflation that occurs in discussions of mood in relation to works of art concerns the difference between a subjectively experienced mood elicited by a work, and the aesthetic mood expressed by the work. Carl Plantinga has usefully elaborated this distinction between human moods (experienced by a subject) and art moods (the pervasive affective tone, atmosphere, or attunement conveyed by a work), what I have elsewhere discussed, drawing on early film theorists, as the Stimmung of a cinematic work. [9]  The mood of a work is distinct from the mood of the spectator, even though the work’s mood – expressing, for example, the perspective of the film’s narration, of a narrator, or a character – usually aims to elicit certain moods from its audience. [10]  I can recognise the mood of gloomy dread or acute anxiety expressed by a horror film without actually experiencing that mood myself while watching the film; or I can be experiencing a certain mood that does not necessarily correspond with that expressed or communicated by the film (a nostalgic mood while watching an old slapstick comedy, for example). In sum, mood primes or orients us emotionally (and cognitively) towards perceiving or attending to certain elements or aspects of a film-world, preparing us for an appropriate engagement with the emotional dynamics that unfold in the course of the narrative. The famous shower scene from Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960), for example, relies heavily on the mood-setting of the preceding scenes – the disquieting, halting conversation between Norman Bates and Marion Crane in the hotel’s gloomy, Gothic, drawing room before she retires to her room – in order for us to be suitably primed for the shower murder scene that follows. A version of the film that deleted this important mood-setting sequence, cutting straight to the shower scene for example, would show how important the creation of mood is for modulating affective intensity and emotional dynamics. In short, moods dispose us to perceive, experience, and respond to a world in certain ways; this is of decisive importance for understanding emotional and cognitive engagement in response to a (fictional or non-fictional) cinematic world. [11]\n\nThe phenomenon of mood is not confined to merely subjective or aesthetic forms of expression. It can also disclose historical and cultural dimensions of memory, experience, and time, in ways that contribute to our experience of a (past or fictionalised) cinematic world. Among the many questions that arise here I would like to pose the following: how are mood and history related in film and in our experience of cinema? How does film mood help render plausible a specific cinematic world, one capable of evoking and expressing distinctive forms of historical experience? In response, consider three ways in which film and history have been related in film theory:\n\n1) Historical inquiry into elements of cinema production, reception, and circulation (histories of film movements, genres, styles, technological developments, compositional techniques, audience reception, etc.). This approach is evident in the manner in which theorists talk about ‘history’ in relation to film today: the idea that the medium, comprising aspects of film production, composition, style, interpretation, circulation, and technological mediation, has a history (or histories) inviting careful empirical study.\n\n2) Historical films in which historical setting or context is explicitly marked or plays a functional role within the narrative (or else a constitutive and/or contributing role in marking a genre). This is the most common way of describing narrative films that are explicitly set in the past (Stanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon, for example) or that refer indirectly to an historical setting as part of their genre conventions (John Ford’s The Searchers or George Cukor’s Gaslight).\n\n3) ‘Symptomatic’ analyses of films as cultural-historical artefacts that reveal social, political, and ideological elements of their historical context (the study of ideological elements in German Expressionist cinema, for example, in Siegfried Kracauer’s famous text, From Caligari to Hitler). This ‘metatheoretical’ sense of history is familiar from the various schools of film theory that have sought to critique the implicit and explicit ideological dimensions of movies as expressions of their cultural-historical context (film noir as an expression of post-war pessimism concerning the ‘American Dream’, existential reflections on the disappointments of capitalist modernity, gender anxieties, and so on).\n\nWe can summarise these three ways of conceptualising the relationship between film and history as the empirical, the aesthetic, and the ideological: the empirical sense of the history of the medium; the aesthetic sense of historical narrative and genre; and the ideological sense of film as an expression of historically specific beliefs, values, or attitudes. Despite their overlap, there is little reflection in contemporary theory focusing on the manner in which affective response and emotional engagement are involved in the experience of history in and through film, or of how movies achieve a compelling sense of historical plausibility in their presentation of particular kinds of cinematic world.\n\nTo gain a clearer sense of historical mood in film, let me elaborate these three ways in which such moods can be expressed and evoked.\n\n1) The first and most obvious way involves films with historical settings that explicitly express historical moods – the way a cinematic mood is supposed to evoke a particular historical ‘feel’, affective quality, or aesthetic atmosphere – as contributing to the successful composition of a cinematic world. The beautifully austere, starkly lit black-and-white shots in Bergman’s The Seventh Seal (1957), for example, coupled with its rich textures of light and shadow, of earth, sea, and sky, trees, mud, and smoke, all contribute to the evocation of a distinctively medieval world, one marked by religious devotion, spiritual anxiety, and a vivid sense of life vying with an acute anticipation of death. Particular films will employ distinctive cinematic styles and aesthetic techniques in order to convey a pervasive affective tonality that we can define as historical mood: Carl Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) compared with Robert Bresson’s Lancelot du Lac (1974); Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950) compared with The Seven Samurai (1954); Terrence Malick’s The New World (2005) versus Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon (2009) (as I discuss below). Even a sense of the future can be regarded as an historical mood. The manner in which science fiction films present the historical sense of ‘futurity’ as a pervasive mood or Stimmung is an important, if neglected, aspect of cinematic world-building: Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Ridley Scott’s Alien (1979) are both exemplary cases of how historical moods need not be confined to the past but can also open up an imagined future.\n\nIt is also possible for the historical expression of moods in movies to be itself subject to historical change. Two films set in the same decade, but made in different historical periods, can express radically different kinds of historical mood: William Wyler’s The Heiress (1944), for example, based on Henry James’ novella, expresses a quite different historical mood concerning its period setting – the wealthy bourgeois milieu of 1850s New York – than Agnieszka Holland’s remake of Washington Square (1997), a difference that reflects not only aesthetic differences in narrative interpretation and cinematic style but cultural and moral-ethical shifts in values, attitudes, and sensibilities.\n\n2) The second way that history and cinema are typically related involves genre films: these frequently evoke historically specific moods as part of the presentation of generic cinematic worlds with their own distinctive aesthetic features. In many cases, historical setting is intrinsic to the genre, or at least a variable that needs to be present even if it can be manipulated or adapted in various ways. Indeed, the historical moods expressed in genre films need not be historically accurate or authentic (although they must still aim for affective-cognitive credibility) but can be expressive, stylised, or inflected for aesthetic or dramatic purposes. In Westerns, historical costume dramas, and film noir, for example, there are usually distinctive historical parameters, often tied to the details of narrative situation, which are expressed in historically distinctive moods (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) has to be set in the period before and after railroad expansion to the West; The Searchers, with its focus on troubled Civil and Mexican War veteran Ethan Edwards, must be set in or around 1868), although it is possible to alter or adapt these historical dimension in crossing between genres (Space Westerns, time travel comedies, neo-noirs, and so on).\n\nFilms that pay homage to, or else critique, specific genres, also have to deal with historical setting, atmosphere, and mood. Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven (1992) does so as a neo-Western, reconstructing but also critiquing the violent masculinist mythology of the classic Western. Roman Polanski’s Chinatown (1974) does so as a neo-noir set in 1938, filmed in a style reflecting the period it was made, rather than reproducing the classic ‘noir’ look, but which nonetheless deals with a story from the early decades of the twentieth century. War films are obviously bound by the historical parameters of their subject matter, even though the historical mood – or related moods – that such films express can vary widely, with differing ethical or ideological connotations (Saving Private Ryan  (1998) versus The Thin Red Line (1999), Good Morning Vietnam (1987) versus Full Metal Jacket (1987)). That this is a distinctive feature of genre films is evinced by the manner in which movie remakes attempt to emulate the visual style, look, and mood of their cinematic models. A genre film that pays homage to its generic predecessors can not only be set in a generically typical period but can strive to emulate the visual style as well as more pervasive features – such as mood or atmosphere – defining that cinematic world. David Fincher’s Zodiac, for example, not only reproduces the style and feel of 1970s police procedurals and crime dramas, but also the mood of sceptical, ambiguous 1970s corruption and conspiracy dramas that refuse any clear narrative resolution (such as The Conversation (1974) and All the President’s Men (1976)).\n\n3) The third way that movies can be historical is not intentional but artefactual or adventitious: the inadvertent but inevitable effect of historicity that marks a movie as belonging to its historically specific moment of production and reception. Indeed, films that implicitly express or disclose historically distinctive moods can be recognised retrospectively as expressions of the cultural-historical sensibilities of their own historical milieus. This is true, of course, of any work of art but it is particularly salient in the case of film, which has, even in the most ardent fiction, an inevitably ‘documentary’ aspect as an artefact expressing its ‘Zeitgeist’ or cultural-historical moment. If I watch an early 1960s Godard film (such as Breathless) today, I am not only watching one of Godard’s nouvelle vague, pre-Maoist works but also an iconic artefact of early 1960s Paris.\n\nA bout de soufflé\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite the film’s playful, anachronistic references to B-grade Hollywood crime dramas, Breathless clearly captures the historical mood or sensibility of its time, conveyed as much through elements of visual style (the revolutionary jump cut technique and theatrical Brechtian interruption of cinematic narrative convention) as through Jean Seberg’s and Jean-Paul Belmondo’s characteristic style, attitude, gestures, and physiognomy. It is not only settings (contemporary Parisian streetscapes, objects, and places) style and performances but also the manner in which we watch such a film with an awareness of its historical pastness that contributes to its artefactual historical mood: a pervasive atmosphere the film reveals as a cultural document of a particular historical moment of artistic and social emancipation with its accompanying sense of freedom.\n\nThere is more to be said about each of these modes of engaging and experiencing history through film. Here, however, I shall focus briefly on two contrasting historical moods in movies: ‘immersive immediacy’ and ‘reflective mediation’. Two recent historical films – Malick’s The New World and Haneke’s The White Ribbon – offer fine examples of this contrast between immersion and reflection in historical moods as well as showing how such moods are essential to the formation of a meaningful cinematic world.\n\nHistorical films – movies set in the past with an appropriate sense of ‘pastness’ – use distinctive kinds of mood to compose a historically specific cinematic world. One way to do this is through an ‘immersive’ experience of that world as expressing its sensuous and material ‘immediacy’: the direct, perceptual presentation of specific affective or sensuous qualities of a world expressed in an ‘enveloping’ manner. There are obvious representational elements that feature in the composition of such a world: the appropriate use of location, landscape, period-specific artefacts and objects, including costume, hairstyles, gestures, language (idiom), even facial physiognomy (as we shall see in The White Ribbon). But there are also more subtle forms of cinematic mood inducement involving the depiction of movement and of time, the use of light and shadow, colour and contrast, variations in camera movement, shot length, cutting rhythms, the use of soundscape, music, and other audiovisual effects.\n\nConsider the opening sequence of Malick’s The New World, a mythopoetic rendering of the conflictual historical encounter between ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Worlds, based on the Pocahontas legend and the memoirs of John Smith. [12]  The film opens with an image of quiet movement across the surface of water, accompanied by a mesmerising voiceover set against the prominent background sounds of birdsong, crickets, and water: “Come, Spirit. Help us sing the story of our land. You are our mother, we your field of corn. We rise from out of the soul of you”. We cut to an image of a beautiful young woman, shot from below, arms raised heavenward, giving thanks to the sky. This sequence is followed by the credits proper, set against a background of animated maps of the Virginia region festooned with animals, birds, and waterways, but also ships, dwellings, and battles. The slow flowing camera movements across water, an immersive movement through elemental nature that gives way to Western cartography and colonialist mythology, introduces the central contrast between worlds that will serve as the dramatic and aesthetic focus of the film.\n\nThe opening image of The New World, accompanied by swelling horns of Wagner’s Das for Das Rheingold Prelude, features naked figures swimming against the sunlit surface of the water. We glimpse a young woman, her face seen from underwater and her hand touching the water’s surface. An image of a young man follows, seen from beneath the water, pointing off into the distance. The next shot reveals three imposing ships entering the harbour and announcing the central contrast of the film: that between the New World, a mythic world immersed in nature, and the Old World, that of the colonisers who have come to establish a new colony on these shores (an inter-title announces the entry into Western history: Virginia, 1607). The sensuous, immersive qualities of these images, defined by flowing movement, elemental nature, human figures set against water, earth, and sky, set the mood as ‘mythopoetic’: combining mythology and poetry in disclosing a sensuously rich, materially textured, mythically charged world, where human action remains at the mercy of nature. The aquatic immersion and mythic cross-cultural resonances between worlds contribute to the mood of sensuous immediacy. Such immersion, however, is tempered by a ‘reflective’ focus on the visual framing of the relationship between Old and New Worlds, which then sets the background for the romantic drama between Pocahontas/Rebecca and John Smith.\n\nThe New World\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStriking throughout is the manner in which Malick and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki combine a naturalistic style (using natural light, location shooting, ‘period’ costume, accurate artefactual, and setting details) with passages of lyrical, poetic abstraction. The effect is both to ‘immerse’ the spectator in the moment of historical encounter or clash between worlds, and to reflect upon the significance of this encounter, both mythical and historical: the tragic ‘founding’ colonialist myth of North America. The mood of sensuous immersion and perceptual immediacy, accompanied by subtle historical reflection on the clash between colonialist and indigenous modes of dwelling, prepares us for the romantic and historical drama – a rewriting of the Pocahontas/John Smith legend – that is about to unfold.\n\nA different approach to evoking historically specific mood can be found in Haneke’s The White Ribbon, notable for its exploration of the social and psychological conditions of violence, the historical experience of trauma, and the collective character of responsibility and guilt. It presents a fable-like prehistory of the Nazi period (set just prior to the outbreak of WWI), focusing on the children who will become adults as part of the Nazi generation. Set in the fictional northern Protestant village of Eichenwald, the film is narrated by the local schoolteacher, who warns us that, although much remains uncertain, his tale of certain “strange events” in the village “might shed a certain light on what happened in this country”. What follows is an examination of social-psychological conditions conducive to the rise of the “authoritarian personality” and some of the historical preconditions that contributed to Germany’s descent into barbarism. [13]  At the same time, Haneke insists that this story is not specific to Germany, but explores the manner in which an absolutist approach to morality, coupled with a culture of cruelty, resentment, and victimisation, can lead to social domination and political authoritarianism, as we see on the rise again today. [14]\n\nThe White Ribbon evokes a different kind of historical mood: a reflective mediation of historical experience that is also visceral and discomfiting in its realism. [15]  The emphasis is less on sensuous immersion and affective-emotional involvement than on distanced engagement and critical reflection. The mood is less expansive and immersive than ambiguous and alienating. The historical world of the film is presented as distanced, reflexively framed, stylised and austere, but also emphasising historical verisimilitude in setting, detail, and character physiognomy. From the silent opening credits, the slow inscription of the film’s subtitle, written in archaic Gothic font (Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte, ‘A German Children’s Tale/Children’s History), to the shocking opening sequence of the Doctor’s riding accident, Haneke’s film eschews the immediacy and vividness of colour in favour of sharp black and white imagery. This aesthetic decision conforms to photographic models of the past (August Sander’s famous folk portraiture and rural landscapes depicting turn-of-the-century German life), thus signifying both ‘pastness’ and a modernist cinematic sensibility. The depicted world is both viscerally real and historically abstracted, materially dense and sensuously textured; it is imbued with a mythic ‘premodern’ or quasi-Feudal quality – alluding perhaps to the thesis of Germany as a ‘belated’ nation – that remains firmly rooted in the decisive year of 1913 before the outbreak of WWI.\n\nThe film opens with a black screen image accompanied by the voice of an elderly narrator: “I don’t know if the story I want to tell you is entirely true. Some of it I only know by hearsay. After so many years, a lot of it is still obscure, and many questions remain unanswered.” The black screen resolves into an image – a landscape of open field, scattered trees, with a grassy clearing in the centre foreground – as the narrator continues: “But I think I must tell of the strange events that occurred in our village, because they could perhaps cast an illuminating light on certain things that happened in this country.” The image is now clear and precise, with a rider visible in the background, galloping towards us. The narrator explains that it all began with the Doctor’s riding accident. As he describes the scene, we see the Doctor’s horse lurch violently to the ground, thanks to a wire stretched across two trees, and the Doctor [Rainer Bock] falling heavily on his chest and shoulder. His daughter witnesses the accident and runs out to attend to her injured father, arranging for him to be transported to the nearest hospital. Already the mood evoked here is ambiguous (the narration warning us that the images that follow may be unreliable) as well as unnerving (a shocking, brutal accident without warning or explanation).\n\nWe are introduced to the Midwife (Susanne Lothar), a single woman in her forties who is also the Doctor’s housekeeper and receptionist; she is shown in profile via a tracking shot that accompanies her as she walks purposefully towards the village school in order to collect her son Karli (Eddy Grahl), who has Downs Syndrome. We encounter the first of the many children – the Pastor’s son Martin (Leonard Proxauf) and his daughter Clara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) – who comprise an unsettling pack associated with the violent incidents to be narrated further in the film. The schoolteacher (Christian Friedel), shown with Karli, is introduced; a sympathetic ‘outsider’ who is also the narrator, telling us his story from the vantage point of many decades (after the end of WWII). The children, always in a group, glance at each other, looking suspicious in their stiffly polite bearing, and then take their leave, ostensibly to ‘see after’ Anna (Roxanne Duran), the Doctor’s teenage daughter. The camera tracks them as they turn from the school and begin walking away, then remains stationary as they head off towards the boundary of the village – a fact that, the narrator remarks, seemed odd to him. The camera holds on the figures of the departing girls as the narrator comments on their behaviour, thus enacting the ambiguous interplay between what we see and what we hear that constitutes a key dialectical tension in the film.\n\nThe White Ribbon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere are a number of features in this sequence that contribute to establishing an historical mood that is mediated, reflective, and ambiguous. Instead of naivety or immersion the film expresses uncertainty, foreboding, and anxiety. I have already mentioned the black-and-white imagery that simultaneously connotes historical distance and photographic veracity, but also adds an austere ‘modernist’ aspect to the events depicted onscreen. The camera placement alternates between static and mobile shots, but in all cases maintains a certain distance, a focus and a reserve in relation to the characters. It might be described as disciplined but reticent: holding very precisely framed shots in long takes that contribute to the evocation of expectation and uncertainty, ambiguity, and anxiety.\n\nThis is evident in the presentation of the children, their uncomfortable bearing, stilted speech, and furtive glances, who not only sound but look like children of the period. Indeed, Haneke and his collaborators were deeply committed to maintaining historical fidelity in regard to setting and artefacts. The casting of the children and other village characters was a laborious affair as they had to be scrutinised in relation to the Sander photographs which served a model for how such characters should look. Only those actors whose physiognomy ‘matched’ that of the historical individuals of the period were given roles in the movie (farmhands, for example, were played by Romanian extras who had the harsh weather-beaten look that was required). This combination of ‘period’ authenticity and historical realism, stylised abstraction and historical reflection, marks The White Ribbon’s historical mood as a reflective, mediated, but ambiguous disclosure of the past. The historical experience of the narrator remains an enigma despite having been lived through, an experience repressed and only partially acknowledged, which only adds to the uncertainty surrounding his narrated account of events. This ambiguity about historical experience will prove central to the film’s treatment of the complex relationship between psychological deformation, social domination, and historical responsibility for the past. The White Ribbon’s visual strategies of reflective mediation establish a mood of historical ambiguity and ambivalence, preparing the spectator for an anticipation of the political violence to come by focusing on the social milieu of the younger generation that would come to maturity during the Nazizeit.\n\nThe topic of historical mood in cinema is clearly still in its infancy. I have outlined different ways that the relationship between film and historical experience might be understood, and explored how historical moods are relevant for the composition and understanding of cinematic worlds. By contrasting two examples of historical mood – immersive immediacy and reflective mediation – we can see how mood contributes to establishing a plausible cinematic world but also orients us affectively and cognitively to experience that world’s ‘pastness’ or its cinematic historicity. To do this justice, however, we need to explore further the historical aspects of emotion; how a sense of the past can be communicated experientially in narrative film. Film theory, in short, should explore not only the subjective and corporeal aspects of affect and emotion but also the complex historical dimensions of movie moods.\n\nThis essay was produced with the support of an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship, “Cinematic Ethics: Exploring Ethical Experience through Film”, (FT130100334)\n\n[1] Michael Walser, quoted in Johannes van Moltke, “Sympathy for the Devil: Cinema, History, and the Politics of Emotion,” New German Critique 102:34:3 (2007): pp.17.\n\n[2] See Noël Carroll, “Art and Mood: Preliminary Notes and Conjectures,” The Monist 86:4 (2003): pp.521-555; Carl Plantinga, “Art Moods and Human Moods in Narrative Cinema,” New Literary History 43:3 (2012): pp.455-475; Greg M.

Drawing on phenomenological and cognitivist approaches, I explore the idea of historical mood in movies, examining how it becomes manifest in different kinds of films: those which articulate explicit historical forms of sensibility as part of their fictional world; genre films which evoke historically particular kinds of mood in creating generically distinctive cinematic worlds; and films that implicitly express moods that can be recognised retrospectively as expressing the cultural–historical sensibilities of their milieu.

This essay explores the concept of historical mood as it is captured in narrative film, and considers its value for film studies and philosophy of film. Although theoretical discussions of spectator engagement within film theory continue to emphasise the notions of emotion and affect, the topic of mood has recently attracted interest from theorists concerned with understanding how emotional engagement is elicited in response to narrative film. Drawing on phenomenological and cognitivist approaches, most theorists approach mood either as a subjective phenomenon, expressing the spectator’s affective response to a film, or as an aesthetic element, expressive of a film’s artistic qualities. Mood, however, is not confined to subjective or aesthetic forms of expression; rather, it can also disclose historical and cultural dimensions of memory, experience and time, both explicitly and implicitly.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            In what follows I explore the idea of historical mood in movies, examining how it becomes manifest in different kinds of films: those with historical settings which articulate explicit historical forms of sensibility as part of their fictional world; genre films which evoke historically particular kinds of mood in creating generically distinctive kinds of cinematic world with their own aesthetic features (melodrama, westerns, film noir, and so on); and films that implicitly express moods that can be recognised retrospectively as expressing the cultural-historical sensibilities of their milieu. Extending the concept of cinematic mood to encompass its cultural and historical aspects, I argue, can enrich current theoretical frameworks for understanding the interplay between emotional engagement, aesthetic expression, and trans-historical experience within and through narrative film.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            The study of emotional engagement with film has become one of the most intensive areas of research in film theory over the last three decades. Drawing on both phenomenological and cognitivist perspectives, film theorists have developed detailed accounts of the role of emotional engagement in cinema and the manner in which narrative film both elicits and expresses affective and emotional states. This focus on emotion was introduced by analytic and cognitivist film theorists, who applied theories drawn from analytic aesthetics and cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology, to the study of emotional responses to narrative film. Within ‘Continental’ film theory, encompassing both phenomenological and Deleuzian approaches, the concept of ‘affect’ has become central, a development that also links up with accounts of the embodied character of cinematic experience. Indeed, one can talk today of an ‘affective turn’ in film theory, drawing on varied approaches that explore different ways of articulating the embodied-affective and emotional-cognitive aspects of our engagement with cinema.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Given this focus on affect and emotion, however, it is curious that the concept of mood has been ignored. Although acknowledged as a key dimension of film genre (by using mood terms to describe certain genres), mood remains an under-theorised concept in prevailing accounts of cinematic emotional engagement. Despite this theoretical neglect, it is a phenomenon that remains essential, I contend, for understanding narrative film, especially for achieving the successful composition of a cinematic world, including historically distant or past (cultural or fictional) worlds.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Why has the study of mood been neglected? There are three reasons I would offer. The first is that mood is difficult to define and phenomenologically opaque. The question of definition is a fraught one, but mood in general can be distinguished from emotion in being more sustained, diffuse, and lacking a determinate intentional object; it is not necessarily linked with action (moods prime us, rather, for particular cognitive and emotional responses). It is more difficult, therefore, to define moods precisely, just as it is more difficult to distinguish the background affective orientation or ‘attunement’ that constitutes a mood from the specific episodic emotional states that might be related to it (a background mood of melancholy, for example, versus a specific episode of sadness).\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            A second reason is that mood is traditionally understood either as a ‘subjective’ experience (and so not readily amenable to analysis via aesthetic theory), or else as an expressive-aesthetic aspect of a work of art (and so not obviously part of psychological or philosophical inquiry). It is common to speak of ‘being in a mood’ to describe someone in the grip of an affective state, where this is understood to reflect a subjective orientation or attitude. Such an understanding of ‘mood’ removes it from the domain of subjective experiences that typically feature in theoretical analyses of aesthetic response and aesthetic judgment. Alternatively, where mood is understood as an aesthetically relevant expressive feature of a work, it is then regarded without particular relevance to psychological or philosophical inquiry. Consequently, on both ‘subjectivist’ and ‘expressive-aesthetic’ views, mood tends to be overlooked in the analysis of aesthetic experience or for developing philosophical theories of mind.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Finally, mood is ordinarily tacitly experienced (rather than explicitly thematised) in our engagement with narrative film; or when it is made explicit, it tends to be subsumed under aesthetic categories as an expressive-aesthetic feature of a work. Mood offers a sustained, diffuse, affectively charged background attunement that orients or ‘biases’ the viewer towards particular (intended) emotional and/or cognitive responses. A horror movie, for example, has to evoke specific moods (suspense, anxiety, dread) in order for the intended forms of affective and emotional responsiveness (involving shock and surprise, or fear and terror) to be solicited and sustained. Mood is not ordinarily an ‘object’ of explicit reflective awareness let alone thematic reflection (though in certain kinds of art film that is precisely how mood is intended to function). Yet if the appropriate forms of mood fail to be solicited, the result is typically a breakdown in the credibility or plausibility of the cinematic world, and hence a failure to maintain intended forms of emotional engagement. A bad horror movie, for example, is not frightening or shocking but comic or ridiculous. Without the successful solicitation of mood, the cinematic world of the horror movie loses what we might call cognitive credibility or affective plausibility. Subsequent attempts to provoke fear or horror fall flat and are experienced at a more reflective level as objects of detached commentary or deliberate mockery (through irony or humour, for example). On the other hand, when mood is made explicitly thematic (and not just confined to a tacitly experienced element of ‘background setting’ or world-building), it is readily subsumed under certain aesthetic categories; thus, for example, the ‘mood’ elements of German expressionist film, evoked using visual contrasts, light and shadow, ambiguous atmosphere, striking visual or aural (musical) effects, are grasped as aesthetic features of a cinematic style and so are not taken as objects of inquiry in their own right.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            As a consequence of these issues, there are few developed theories of mood (whether phenomenological or cognitivist) to be found within the history of film theory. With the exception of certain early film theorists, especially those responding to German Expressionist film (Lotte Eisner, for example), theories of affect and emotion continue to dominate theoretical discussion of our experience of narrative film. This is unfortunate since mood remains an essential, if poorly understood, feature of our subjective experience of film, but also of the successful aesthetic composition of a (typically fictional) cinematic world, without which both our subjective engagement and aesthetic appreciation of a film would be diminished or impaired.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Although still a matter of debate, moods can be distinguished from emotions in a number of ways. Here I identify five features that distinguish moods from emotions, and which have particular significance for the composition and reception of narrative film.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <list>\n            <item>\n                <description>As remarked, they can be distinguished by their non-intentional character: moods lack a determinate or specific intentional object – in the phenomenological sense of an object towards which consciousness is ‘directed’ – as distinct from emotions that typically have an identifiable intentional object (for example, my fear of a speeding car or of losing my job).</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>Moods can be distinguished by their capacity to orient or ‘bias’ viewers towards certain emotional and/or cognitive responses (when feeling anxious, for example, I am more likely to perceive objects as disturbing or threatening than would otherwise be the case).</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>Moods have a more diffuse causality compared with emotions: they have causes (to do with our environment or our subjective state) rather than reasons (that could be offered as motivating or explaining the source and significance of our response).</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>Moods are more temporally extended than emotions, which usually are briefer, discrete episodes.</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>Moods can be defined by their ‘world-revealing’ quality: they provide an affective ‘colouring’ that orients our cognitive, emotional, and practical engagement with the world, opening up or closing off spheres of meaning and of possible action. Elements of my environment can show up as affectively charged or cognitively salient thanks to the background mood that orients my practical engagement with the world. This feature is important for narrative film: mood is a necessary feature of the composition of a plausible cinematic world in which emotional engagement can successfully occur (or fail to occur).</description>\n            </item>\n        </list>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            A common conflation that occurs in discussions of mood in relation to works of art concerns the difference between a subjectively experienced mood elicited by a work, and the aesthetic mood expressed by the work. Carl Plantinga has usefully elaborated this distinction between human moods (experienced by a subject) and art moods (the pervasive affective tone, atmosphere, or attunement conveyed by a work), what I have elsewhere discussed, drawing on early film theorists, as the <Themes>Stimmung</Themes> of a cinematic work. The mood of a work is distinct from the mood of the spectator, even though the work’s mood – expressing, for example, the perspective of the film’s narration, of a narrator, or a character – usually aims to elicit certain moods from its audience. I can recognise the mood of gloomy dread or acute anxiety expressed by a horror film without actually experiencing that mood myself while watching the film; or I can be experiencing a certain mood that does not necessarily correspond with that expressed or communicated by the film (a nostalgic mood while watching an old slapstick comedy, for example). In sum, mood primes or orients us emotionally (and cognitively) towards perceiving or attending to certain elements or aspects of a film-world, preparing us for an appropriate engagement with the emotional dynamics that unfold in the course of the narrative.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            The famous shower scene from <Name>Psycho</Name> (<Director>Alfred Hitchcock</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1960</ReleaseYear>) relies heavily on the mood-setting of the preceding scenes – the disquieting, halting conversation between Norman Bates and Marion Crane in the hotel’s gloomy, Gothic, drawing room before she retires to her room – in order for us to be suitably primed for the shower murder scene that follows. A version of the film that deleted this important mood-setting sequence, cutting straight to the shower scene for example, would show how important the creation of mood is for modulating affective intensity and emotional dynamics. In short, moods dispose us to perceive, experience, and respond to a world in certain ways; this is of decisive importance for understanding emotional and cognitive engagement in response to a (fictional or non-fictional) cinematic world.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            The phenomenon of mood is not confined to merely subjective or aesthetic forms of expression. It can also disclose historical and cultural dimensions of memory, experience, and time, in ways that contribute to our experience of a (past or fictionalised) cinematic world. Among the many questions that arise here I would like to pose the following: how are mood and history related in film and in our experience of cinema? How does film mood help render plausible a specific cinematic world, one capable of evoking and expressing distinctive forms of historical experience? In response, consider three ways in which film and history have been related in film theory:\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <list>\n            <item>\n                <description>Historical inquiry into elements of cinema production, reception, and circulation (histories of film movements, genres, styles, technological developments, compositional techniques, audience reception, etc.). This approach is evident in the manner in which theorists talk about ‘history’ in relation to film today: the idea that the medium, comprising aspects of film production, composition, style, interpretation, circulation, and technological mediation, has a history (or histories) inviting careful empirical study.</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>Historical films in which historical setting or context is explicitly marked or plays a functional role within the narrative (or else a constitutive and/or contributing role in marking a genre). This is the most common way of describing narrative films that are explicitly set in the past (Stanley Kubrick’s <Name>Barry Lyndon</Name>, for example) or that refer indirectly to an historical setting as part of their genre conventions (John Ford’s <Name>The Searchers</Name> or George Cukor’s <Name>Gaslight</Name>).</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>‘Symptomatic’ analyses of films as cultural-historical artefacts that reveal social, political, and ideological elements of their historical context (the study of ideological elements in German Expressionist cinema, for example, in Siegfried Kracauer’s famous text, From Caligari to Hitler). This ‘metatheoretical’ sense of history is familiar from the various schools of film theory that have sought to critique the implicit and explicit ideological dimensions of movies as expressions of their cultural-historical context (film noir as an expression of post-war pessimism concerning the ‘American Dream’, existential reflections on the disappointments of capitalist modernity, gender anxieties, and so on).</description>\n            </item>\n        </list>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            We can summarise these three ways of conceptualising the relationship between film and history as the empirical, the aesthetic, and the ideological: the empirical sense of the history of the medium; the aesthetic sense of historical narrative and genre; and the ideological sense of film as an expression of historically specific beliefs, values, or attitudes. Despite their overlap, there is little reflection in contemporary theory focusing on the manner in which affective response and emotional engagement are involved in the experience of history in and through film, or of how movies achieve a compelling sense of historical plausibility in their presentation of particular kinds of cinematic world.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            To gain a clearer sense of historical mood in film, let me elaborate these three ways in which such moods can be expressed and evoked.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <list>\n            <item>\n                <description>The first and most obvious way involves films with historical settings that explicitly express historical moods – the way a cinematic mood is supposed to evoke a particular historical ‘feel’, affective quality, or aesthetic atmosphere – as contributing to the successful composition of a cinematic world. The beautifully austere, starkly lit black-and-white shots in <Name>The Seventh Seal</Name> (<Director>Ingmar Bergman</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1957</ReleaseYear>), for example, coupled with its rich textures of light and shadow, of earth, sea, and sky, trees, mud, and smoke, all contribute to the evocation of a distinctively medieval world, one marked by religious devotion, spiritual anxiety, and a vivid sense of life vying with an acute anticipation of death. Particular films will employ distinctive cinematic styles and aesthetic techniques in order to convey a pervasive affective tonality that we can define as historical mood: <Name>The Passion of Joan of Arc</Name> (<Director>Carl Dreyer</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1928</ReleaseYear>) compared with <Name>Lancelot du Lac</Name> (<Director>Robert Bresson</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1974</ReleaseYear>); <Name>Rashomon</Name> (<Director>Akira Kurosawa</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1950</ReleaseYear>) compared with <Name>The Seven Samurai</Name> (<Director>Akira Kurosawa</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1954</ReleaseYear>); <Name>The New World</Name> (<Director>Terrence Malick</Director>, <ReleaseYear>2005</ReleaseYear>) versus <Name>The White Ribbon</Name> (<Director>Michael Haneke</Director>, <ReleaseYear>2009</ReleaseYear>) (as I discuss below). Even a sense of the future can be regarded as an historical mood. The manner in which science fiction films present the historical sense of ‘futurity’ as a pervasive mood or Stimmung is an important, if neglected, aspect of cinematic world-building: <Name>2001: A Space Odyssey</Name> (<Director>Stanley Kubrick</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1968</ReleaseYear>) or <Name>Alien</Name> (<Director>Ridley Scott</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1979</ReleaseYear>) are both exemplary cases of how historical moods need not be confined to the past but can also open up an imagined future.</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>It is also possible for the historical expression of moods in movies to be itself subject to historical change. Two films set in the same decade, but made in different historical periods, can express radically different kinds of historical mood: <Name>The Heiress</Name> (<Director>William Wyler</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1944</ReleaseYear>), for example, based on Henry James’ novella, expresses a quite different historical mood concerning its period setting – the wealthy bourgeois milieu of 1850s New York – than <Name>Washington Square</Name> (<Director>Agnieszka Holland</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1997</ReleaseYear>), a difference that reflects not only aesthetic differences in narrative interpretation and cinematic style but cultural and moral-ethical shifts in values, attitudes, and sensibilities.</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>The second way that history and cinema are typically related involves genre films: these frequently evoke historically specific moods as part of the presentation of generic cinematic worlds with their own distinctive aesthetic features. In many cases, historical setting is intrinsic to the genre, or at least a variable that needs to be present even if it can be manipulated or adapted in various ways. Indeed, the historical moods expressed in genre films need not be historically accurate or authentic (although they must still aim for affective-cognitive credibility) but can be expressive, stylised, or inflected for aesthetic or dramatic purposes. In Westerns, historical costume dramas, and film noir, for example, there are usually distinctive historical parameters, often tied to the details of narrative situation, which are expressed in historically distinctive moods (<Name>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1962</ReleaseYear>) has to be set in the period before and after railroad expansion to the West; <Name>The Searchers</Name>, with its focus on troubled Civil and Mexican War veteran Ethan Edwards, must be set in or around 1868), although it is possible to alter or adapt these historical dimension in crossing between genres (Space Westerns, time travel comedies, neo-noirs, and so on).</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>Films that pay homage to, or else critique, specific genres, also have to deal with historical setting, atmosphere, and mood. <Name>Unforgiven</Name> (<Director>Clint Eastwood</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1992</ReleaseYear>) does so as a neo-Western, reconstructing but also critiquing the violent masculinist mythology of the classic Western. <Name>Chinatown</Name> (<Director>Roman Polanski</Director>, <ReleaseYear>1974</ReleaseYear>) does so as a neo-noir set in 1938, filmed in a style reflecting the period it was made, rather than reproducing the classic ‘noir’ look, but which nonetheless deals with a story from the early decades of the twentieth century. War films are obviously bound by the historical parameters of their subject matter, even though the historical mood – or related moods – that such films express can vary widely, with differing ethical or ideological connotations (<Name>Saving Private Ryan</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1998</ReleaseYear>) versus <Name>The Thin Red Line</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1999</ReleaseYear>), <Name>Good Morning Vietnam</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1987</ReleaseYear>) versus <Name>Full Metal Jacket</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1987</ReleaseYear>)). That this is a distinctive feature of genre films is evinced by the manner in which movie remakes attempt to emulate the visual style, look, and mood of their cinematic models. <Name>Zodiac</Name> (<Director>David Fincher</Director>) not only reproduces the style and feel of 1970s police procedurals and crime dramas, but also the mood of sceptical, ambiguous 1970s corruption and conspiracy dramas that refuse any clear narrative resolution (such as <Name>The Conversation</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1974</ReleaseYear>) and <Name>All the President’s Men</Name> (<ReleaseYear>1976</ReleaseYear>)).</description>\n            </item>\n            <item>\n                <description>The third way that movies can be historical is not intentional but artefactual or adventitious: the inadvertent but inevitable effect of historicity that marks a movie as belonging to its historically specific moment of production and reception. Indeed, films that implicitly express or disclose historically distinctive moods can be recognised retrospectively as expressions of the cultural-historical sensibilities of their own historical milieus. This is true, of course, of any work of art but it is particularly salient in the case of film, which has, even in the most ardent fiction, an inevitably ‘documentary’ aspect as an artefact expressing its ‘Zeitgeist’ or cultural-historical moment. If I watch an early 1960s Godard film (such as <Name>Breathless</Name>) today, I am not only watching one of Godard’s nouvelle vague, pre-Maoist works but also an iconic artefact of early 1960s Paris.</description>\n            </item>\n        </list>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Despite the film’s playful, anachronistic references to B-grade Hollywood crime dramas, <Name>Breathless</Name> clearly captures the historical mood or sensibility of its time, conveyed as much through elements of visual style (the revolutionary jump cut technique and theatrical Brechtian interruption of cinematic narrative convention) as through Jean Seberg’s and Jean-Paul Belmondo’s characteristic style, attitude, gestures, and physiognomy. It is not only settings (contemporary Parisian streetscapes, objects, and places) style and performances but also the manner in which we watch such a film with an awareness of its historical pastness that contributes to its artefactual historical mood: a pervasive atmosphere the film reveals as a cultural document of a particular historical moment of artistic and social emancipation with its accompanying sense of freedom.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            There is more to be said about each of these modes of engaging and experiencing history through film. Here, however, I shall focus briefly on two contrasting historical moods in movies: ‘immersive immediacy’ and ‘reflective mediation’. Two recent historical films – <Name>The New World</Name> (<Director>Terrence Malick</Director>, <ReleaseYear>2005</ReleaseYear>) and <Name>The White Ribbon</Name> (<Director>Michael Haneke</Director>, <ReleaseYear>2009</ReleaseYear>) – offer fine examples of this contrast between immersion and reflection in historical moods as well as showing how such moods are essential to the formation of a meaningful cinematic world.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Historical films – movies set in the past with an appropriate sense of ‘pastness’ – use distinctive kinds of mood to compose a historically specific cinematic world. One way to do this is through an ‘immersive’ experience of that world as expressing its sensuous and material ‘immediacy’: the direct, perceptual presentation of specific affective or sensuous qualities of a world expressed in an ‘enveloping’ manner. There are obvious representational elements that feature in the composition of such a world: the appropriate use of location, landscape, period-specific artefacts and objects, including costume, hairstyles, gestures, language (idiom), even facial physiognomy (as we shall see in <Name>The White Ribbon</Name>). But there are also more subtle forms of cinematic mood inducement involving the depiction of movement and of time, the use of light and shadow, colour and contrast, variations in camera movement, shot length, cutting rhythms, the use of soundscape, music, and other audiovisual effects.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Consider the opening sequence of <Name>The New World</Name>, a mythopoetic rendering of the conflictual historical encounter between ‘Old’ and ‘New’ Worlds, based on the Pocahontas legend and the memoirs of John Smith. The film opens with an image of quiet movement across the surface of water, accompanied by a mesmerising voiceover set against the prominent background sounds of birdsong, crickets, and water: “Come, Spirit. Help us sing the story of our land. You are our mother, we your field of corn. We rise from out of the soul of you”. We cut to an image of a beautiful young woman, shot from below, arms raised heavenward, giving thanks to the sky. This sequence is followed by the credits proper, set against a background of animated maps of the Virginia region festooned with animals, birds, and waterways, but also ships, dwellings, and battles. The slow flowing camera movements across water, an immersive movement through elemental nature that gives way to Western cartography and colonialist mythology, introduces the central contrast between worlds that will serve as the dramatic and aesthetic focus of the film.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            The opening image of <Name>The New World</Name>, accompanied by swelling horns of Wagner’s <Themes>Das Rheingold Prelude</Themes>, features naked figures swimming against the sunlit surface of the water. We glimpse a young woman, her face seen from underwater and her hand touching the water’s surface. An image of a young man follows, seen from beneath the water, pointing off into the distance. The next shot reveals three imposing ships entering the harbour and announcing the central contrast of the film: that between the New World, a mythic world immersed in nature, and the Old World, that of the colonisers who have come to establish a new colony on these shores (an inter-title announces the entry into Western history: Virginia, 1607). The sensuous, immersive qualities of these images, defined by flowing movement, elemental nature, human figures set against water, earth, and sky, set the mood as ‘mythopoetic’: combining mythology and poetry in disclosing a sensuously rich, materially textured, mythically charged world, where human action remains at the mercy of nature. The aquatic immersion and mythic cross-cultural resonances between worlds contribute to the mood of sensuous immediacy. Such immersion, however, is tempered by a ‘reflective’ focus on the visual framing of the relationship between Old and New Worlds, which then sets the background for the romantic drama between Pocahontas/Rebecca and John Smith.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Striking throughout is the manner in which Malick and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki combine a naturalistic style (using natural light, location shooting, ‘period’ costume, accurate artefactual, and setting details) with passages of lyrical, poetic abstraction. The effect is both to ‘immerse’ the spectator in the moment of historical encounter or clash between worlds, and to reflect upon the significance of this encounter, both mythical and historical: the tragic ‘founding’ colonialist myth of North America. The mood of sensuous immersion and perceptual immediacy, accompanied by subtle historical reflection on the clash between colonialist and indigenous modes of dwelling, prepares us for the romantic and historical drama – a rewriting of the Pocahontas/John Smith legend – that is about to unfold.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            A different approach to evoking historically specific mood can be found in <Name>The White Ribbon</Name>, notable for its exploration of the social and psychological conditions of violence, the historical experience of trauma, and the collective character of responsibility and guilt. It presents a fable-like prehistory of the Nazi period (set just prior to the outbreak of WWI), focusing on the children who will become adults as part of the Nazi generation. Set in the fictional northern Protestant village of Eichenwald, the film is narrated by the local schoolteacher, who warns us that, although much remains uncertain, his tale of certain “strange events” in the village “might shed a certain light on what happened in this country”. What follows is an examination of social-psychological conditions conducive to the rise of the “authoritarian personality” and some of the historical preconditions that contributed to Germany’s descent into barbarism.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            <Name>The White Ribbon</Name> evokes a different kind of historical mood: a reflective mediation of historical experience that is also visceral and discomfiting in its realism. The emphasis is less on sensuous immersion and affective-emotional involvement than on distanced engagement and critical reflection. The mood is less expansive and immersive than ambiguous and alienating. The historical world of the film is presented as distanced, reflexively framed, stylised and austere, but also emphasising historical verisimilitude in setting, detail, and character physiognomy. From the silent opening credits, the slow inscription of the film’s subtitle, written in archaic Gothic font (Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte, ‘A German Children’s Tale/Children’s History), to the shocking opening sequence of the Doctor’s riding accident, Haneke’s film eschews the immediacy and vividness of colour in favour of sharp black and white imagery. This aesthetic decision conforms to photographic models of the past (August Sander’s famous folk portraiture and rural landscapes depicting turn-of-the-century German life), thus signifying both ‘pastness’ and a modernist cinematic sensibility. The depicted world is both viscerally real and historically abstracted, materially dense and sensuously textured; it is imbued with a mythic ‘premodern’ or quasi-Feudal quality – alluding perhaps to the thesis of Germany as a ‘belated’ nation – that remains firmly rooted in the decisive year of 1913 before the outbreak of WWI.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            The film opens with a black screen image accompanied by the voice of an elderly narrator: “I don’t know if the story I want to tell you is entirely true. Some of it I only know by hearsay. After so many years, a lot of it is still obscure, and many questions remain unanswered.” The black screen resolves into an image – a landscape of open field, scattered trees, with a grassy clearing in the centre foreground – as the narrator continues: “But I think I must tell of the strange events that occurred in our village, because they could perhaps cast an illuminating light on certain things that happened in this country.” The image is now clear and precise, with a rider visible in the background, galloping towards us. The narrator explains that it all began with the Doctor’s riding accident. As he describes the scene, we see the Doctor’s horse lurch violently to the ground, thanks to a wire stretched across two trees, and the Doctor falling heavily on his chest and shoulder. His daughter witnesses the accident and runs out to attend to her injured father, arranging for him to be transported to the nearest hospital. Already the mood evoked here is ambiguous (the narration warning us that the images that follow may be unreliable) as well as unnerving (a shocking, brutal accident without warning or explanation).\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            We are introduced to the Midwife (Susanne Lothar), a single woman in her forties who is also the Doctor’s housekeeper and receptionist; she is shown in profile via a tracking shot that accompanies her as she walks purposefully towards the village school in order to collect her son Karli (Eddy Grahl), who has Downs Syndrome. We encounter the first of the many children – the Pastor’s son Martin (Leonard Proxauf) and his daughter Clara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) – who comprise an unsettling pack associated with the violent incidents to be narrated further in the film. The schoolteacher (Christian Friedel), shown with Karli, is introduced; a sympathetic ‘outsider’ who is also the narrator, telling us his story from the vantage point of many decades (after the end of WWII). The children, always in a group, glance at each other, looking suspicious in their stiffly polite bearing, and then take their leave, ostensibly to ‘see after’ Anna (Roxanne Duran), the Doctor’s teenage daughter. The camera tracks them as they turn from the school and begin walking away, then remains stationary as they head off towards the boundary of the village – a fact that, the narrator remarks, seemed odd to him. The camera holds on the figures of the departing girls as the narrator comments on their behaviour, thus enacting the ambiguous interplay between what we see and what we hear that constitutes a key dialectical tension in the film.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            There are a number of features in this sequence that contribute to establishing an historical mood that is mediated, reflective, and ambiguous. Instead of naivety or immersion the film expresses uncertainty, foreboding, and anxiety. I have already mentioned the black-and-white imagery that simultaneously connotes historical distance and photographic veracity, but also adds an austere ‘modernist’ aspect to the events depicted onscreen. The camera placement alternates between static and mobile shots, but in all cases maintains a certain distance, a focus and a reserve in relation to the characters. It might be described as disciplined but reticent: holding very precisely framed shots in long takes that contribute to the evocation of expectation and uncertainty, ambiguity, and anxiety.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            This is evident in the presentation of the children, their uncomfortable bearing, stilted speech, and furtive glances, who not only sound but look like children of the period. Indeed, Haneke and his collaborators were deeply committed to maintaining historical fidelity in regard to setting and artefacts. The casting of the children and other village characters was a laborious affair as they had to be scrutinised in relation to the Sander photographs which served a model for how such characters should look. Only those actors whose physiognomy ‘matched’ that of the historical individuals of the period were given roles in the movie (farmhands, for example, were played by Romanian extras who had the harsh weather-beaten look that was required). This combination of ‘period’ authenticity and historical realism, stylised abstraction and historical reflection, marks <Name>The White Ribbon</Name>’s historical mood as a reflective, mediated, but ambiguous disclosure of the past. The historical experience of the narrator remains an enigma despite having been lived through, an experience repressed and only partially acknowledged, which only adds to the uncertainty surrounding his narrated account of events. The historical mood of <Name>The White Ribbon</Name>’s visual strategies of reflective mediation establish a mood of historical ambiguity and ambivalence, preparing the spectator for an anticipation of the political violence to come by focusing on the social milieu of the younger generation that would come to maturity during the Nazizeit.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            The topic of historical mood in cinema is clearly still in its infancy. I have outlined different ways that the relationship between film and historical experience might be understood, and explored how historical moods are relevant for the composition and understanding of cinematic worlds. By contrasting two examples of historical mood – immersive immediacy and reflective mediation – we can see how mood contributes to establishing a plausible cinematic world but also orients us affectively and cognitively to experience that world’s ‘pastness’ or its cinematic historicity. To do this justice, however, we need to explore further the historical aspects of emotion; how a sense of the past can be communicated experientially in narrative film. Film theory, in short, should explore not only the subjective and corporeal aspects of affect and emotion but also the complex historical dimensions of movie moods.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <footer>\n            <author>Robert Sinnerbrink</author>\n            <additionalInformation>\n                This essay was produced with the support of an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship, “Cinematic Ethics: Exploring Ethical Experience through Film”, (FT130100334)\n            </additionalInformation>\n        </footer>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have inserted the relevant XML tags according to the attributes specified in the ADT.

K. A Martha's appearance on the Piers Morgan show where she denied all allegations made about her in this series.\n\nThe most admirable aspect about this series is the fact that Richard, or Donny, never portrayed himself to be just the victim. He was honest about his mistakes, and all the things he may have done to lead Martha on. He also didn't portray Martha to be just an abuser. I think the show did well to portray that Martha also had her good parts and was herself a victim to her childhood tragedies. There was nothing one-sided about the way he told his story. The series is quite unconventional in the way that the narrative was so much than just Victim vs. Abuser.

I went into this expecting a fluffy romantic comedy, and there was much, much more to this than I expected. There are themes (I won't spoil them for you) that add quite the depth to the romance and the comedy. Stil, when it wants to be fun and light-hearted, it is, while never feeling sugarcoated. And it also never falls into the expected melodrama of most korean drama. In the last few episodes, I was quite impressed by how powerful some scenes were (scenes I did not expect at first, and then dreaded later on because I fear consistently melodrama). Yet, this show is able to pull out the wealth of emotions from a scene without ever feeling cheesy, cliché or meek. \n\nFrom beginning to end, this show is on point. It has its own identity and it is worth watching. Especially for the wonderful acting of every single character on this show. Every single actor plays incredibly well, and mostly, every character is deeply interesting. I tried to do this review while shying away from anything that could spoil it for you, but, unless you are looking for a thriller-adventure TV show at the moment, I don't see how you could not love this. This is a korean classic and do not look over this one only because it has only a few people who rated this. It will become known over here soon enough, I'm sure.\n\n- sam-levesque\n- Mar 28, 2015\n- Permalink\n\n### Pretty solid Korean TV melodrama!\n\nIt's Okay, It's Love: 2014 Korean TV melodrama,16 episodes.\n\nStory: Relationship adverse psychiatrist meets popular playboy novelist. They are seemingly mismatched for one another, but they end up having to live together as roommates due to some contrived circumstances. They soon start to develop feelings for one another, and thus, another K-drama love story is underway.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nIf the story sounds familiar to you, well, of course it does; many of these K-drama shows invoke the same basic story being retold again &amp; again with just slight variations. This show involves two thirty some year old leads that fall in love and try to stay in love, overcome obstacles along the way, and eventually try to find some peace or happiness at the end of it all regardless of what happens. For these shows to work, all you really need is some experienced leads and some decent writing, and, you need to keep the show at a minimal number of episodes that include enough interesting auxiliary characters and side stories to keep everything moving along when the lead love story isn't the focal point. This particular show, while nowhere near the best K-drama I've seen, accomplishes enough of the aforementioned ingredients to be above satisfactory at the very least.\n\nAside from the love story, the overall theme of this show focuses on the general healing of past &amp; present emotional wounds among the characters. Along with the female lead, 2 of the secondary cast members are also psychiatrists, and many of the side stories occur in a hospital dealing with random patients that need some help. The psychiatrists aren't much better off than some of their patients though, and the same goes for everyone else on this show, as they all have their own deep seeded personal problems to reconcile (some more than others). Most of the interaction with the patients is just window dressing &amp; filler, as the docs diagnose a different disorder for each weekly new patient, then fix 'em up and send them on their way. Don't expect to gain any deep insight about the field of psychiatry when you watch this show; it's pretty clear the writers and cast are just winging it as best they can after briefly perusing a Psychiatry for Dummies book.\n\nJo In-sung &amp; Gong Hyo-jin are your two leads. Neither is a stranger to this genre, and they've each played similar characters many times before. Jo In-sung has long since mastered playing the suave &amp; smug handsome guy who comes complete with a past tragedy and stoic underlying intentions. Gong Hyo-jin is an expert at portraying the attractive &amp; caring, yet somewhat flawed &amp; vulnerable woman that just needs to find that one special guy that truly understands her. They work very well together, but it's not so much that the two stars have some searing on-screen chemistry, as it is that they're both just real solid pros who know what's needed to play these parts. In an indication of how professional these actors are, Gong Hyo-jin doesn't delay or disrupt the series at all when she breaks her arm off set in an accident; she just shows up for work as usual, the writers hurriedly fit this mishap into the daily script re-writes, and the show doesn't miss a beat.\n\nThe rest of the cast is all right. No complaints really. There are number of solid veterans on hand, along with several other interesting characters, and two younglings who get the resident flower boy and snotty hottie roles while they work on their acting chops. A lot of these side characters have their own relationship and or emotional issues to deal with as the show progresses. There are really no secondary love interests that compete for the leads' affections though; one dude tries to \"re-involve\" himself with Gong Hyo-jin occasionally, but she ain't having none of his nonsense. This character also serves as somewhat of antagonist, albeit a very meek one, in a story that has very few of antagonists at all...the only true antagonist in play is Jo In-sung's older delinquent brother, who's soon to be released from prison and is determined to cause some trouble with his family secret &amp; desire for justice. This show doesn't really put its focus on love triangles or ridiculously mean/evil peopleit's much more about relationships and healing and that sort of thing.\n\nOne thing I really liked about this show, and deserves special mention, is its idea of giving Jo In-sung's character a \"hidden alter ego\" (so to speak). I can't say too much about this without spoiling things because it's somewhat crucial to the story. It won't take you long to catch on to it though if you're paying attention, and, eventually it's made blatantly obvious later on. This story line could have even been better implemented if more time was allowed to think it through a little more, but this is KTV \"on-the-fly\", so I must commend the writers for even trying to implement it and for pulling it off as well as they did.\n\nSummary: I don't really have many complaints with this show to be honest...Everything is pretty good, and it makes for a pretty decent &amp; solid K-drama overall. Probably best suited to late 20's-mid 40's viewing crowd, but there's very little vulgarity or violence as usual, and no sex; so, just about anyone can watch it and not be overly offended.\n\nBottom Line: 7.5-8 out of 10 stars on the KTV drama scale!...I'll recommend it!\n\n- cremea\n- Oct 17, 2014\n- Permalink\n\n### Pleasantly Surprised!\n\nI generally dislike older k-dramas, but I heard good things about this show and decided to give it a shot. What a pleasant surprise!\n\nThis show has more mature themes and plot lines than almost any k drama I have ever seen, but for the most part these were handled maturely. I was particularly taken aback by how good the acting was in this - both the ML and FL were outstanding. I found the FL to be quite irritating for about the first half of the show - spoiled, temperamental, and unfair to the ML most of the time. What was really refreshing was how the ML handled the FL, I absolutely loved his \"give as good as he got\" attitude. He was mature but also fair in their interactions.\n\nI also thought all the mental illnesses were handled very well! There was a lot of professionalism and realistic portrayals, so I was very impressed with that. A lot of shows (including Hollywood shows in particular) tend to portray mental illness, especially schizophrenia, as an illness that manifests as aggressive and dangerous. I really liked how they showed how most of the time these illnesses are not dangerous to other people, if anyone its to the patients themselves.\n\nOverall this was a really enjoyable watch, I am so glad I gave it a shot!\n\n- fake\\_moviestar\n- Jul 21, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### The only Korean show which did not have even a single childish part or joke.\n\nWell, this is definitely one of the best Kdramas i have seen in a while. I don't even like calling IOTL a k drama but i'd rather prefer calling it a Korean show. It was simply amazing.I will recommend it to everyone. I am not a doctor, so i can't say how aptly the psychiatric aspect of the show was portrayed. But, i want to point out how nicely the show was written and the different characters were interwoven with each other. The show was 6 at the beginning, but as the story moved on it kept on getting better and better and by the 12th episode, it got to 10. The actors did an extraordinary job. The main actor was outstanding. His character was so vulnerable at one point and he acted that part so beautifully, I can't even. The main actress, her dressing sense was so good. Her character was irritating at times but she can't help it as the character was written that way and she acted really well as well. TBH all the characters did an amazing job. The kisses were so real and felt raw. Those kind of kisses are difficult to find in kdramas.:D And finally the OST. It was so good and the songs were played on such needed moments. \"Let me go, I don't wanna be your HERO\", that song gave me goosebumps every time it was played on the show. All in all, it was definitely one of the best Korean Shows.\n\n- Susan19995\n- Jun 15, 2017\n- Permalink\n\n### Perfection\n\nI am already a Korean drama addict so I love all the cheesiness and the puppy love often displayed in Korean dramas. I went into this drama thinking the same way especially because of the cheesy title but boy was I wrong. The plot, actors, acting and the scene of this drama is absolutely beautiful. Zo In Sung and Hyo Jin portray their characters so well that people think they are an item in real life. The plot also gives a refreshing storyline for kdramas as it focuses on such a rare yet very important topic in society. This drama will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and at the end will leave you stunned. Another thing I loved was that the end wasn't just random and abrupt but was well put together and beautiful. The writer did such an amazing job. This is my beast kdrama now along with 'I can hear your voice'. This is my 2nd time watching it now because I want to notice all the little inner acting and messages I might have missed the first time. lol. I would definitely recommend this drama to everyone regardless of your gender or age. Watch this not just to kill time but to actually enjoy a drama.\n\n- estheriroro\n- Sep 27, 2014\n- Permalink\n\n### One of my fave kdramas\n\nJo In-Sung and Gong Hyu Jin's chemistry are just magnificient!

A unique one...not just a ordinary love story if u think so.. with twists n turns.\nPERFECTION..!!\n\n- vidhyag\n- Jan 18, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### The Best Korean Drama I've ever watched\n\nThis drama its not like other dramas it doesn't have cliches and it will definitely make you cry at the end. The message throughout the drama is so powerful. Each character has own unique problem which people can relate but like the drama said its okay to have problems. I watched this drama a year ago but still when I think about it I get so emotional. It left a permanent mark in my heart. Also the soundtrack is one of the best soundtrack of all time.\n\n- Aliceinhll\n- May 22, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Way heavier than anticipated\n\nI wouldn't recommend It'S OK, That's Love to everyone. I am glad series begin exploring mental disorders, but this was way heavier than what I was looking for. They throw the whole gimmick, schizophrenia, OCD, domestic violence, child abuse, rape, that's a little much for a series classified under romance. I watched it until the end because I was still curious, but this was depressing and at times disturbing if you e experienced some of those yourself.\n\nThe production was very good either with transitions being abrupt, music not well aligned, etc.\n\nI think this series should come with a few warnings as it can be triggering for some.\n\n- smsteffy-82376\n- Nov 19, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Most entertaining Kdrama\n\nIt has everything that makes for a good show - great cast, good acting by all, great chemistry between characters,good balance of comedy, romance and serious storyline and last and the most important of all - it's been written so well. Kudos to the writer of the show. Must watch if one is looking for a non cliche light romcom drama.\n\n- kharevijayavk\n- Feb 10, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### one thing i don't like about this drama\n\nIt is definitely not your typical kdrama. It has so much more than JUST a rom-com. Literally I'm surprised how this drama portrays all those topics very easily which are still considered taboo in Asian society. The actors fully deliver beautiful acting because often there are one take scenes which feels so natural. The plot &amp; characters are written so well props to writers &amp; director who made this drama a masterpiece but one thing i don't like about this drama is that ML's character always talks about how important consent is &amp; how he would never do anything if women says no yet continues to kiss FL without consent she clearly have issues but somehow her issues are vanished when he kisses her which felt a bit unrealistic. Other than that i can not talk more about how charming ML is &amp; his chemistry with FL outstanding.\n\n- zizuziza-79349\n- Feb 26, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Melodrama\n\nWell ,the drama starts in an awkward way. A lot of \"jokes\" and dialogues makes the drama seems to be only for adults. However ,continuing , the series start to be interesting. The story around the novelist is really well made, as well as the relationship with his brother has some touchy moments. The Ost was incredible ,too!\n\nThe negatives for me start with Ji Hae-soo 's story and family. I think it would be better if Ji Hae-soo was just a simple psychiatrist without the disorder story which seems unessecary to me. Moreover, I didn't like her mother behavior and her family story was just unnecessary too. The sexual jokes were , also so much, that I can't bear it. It results to be disgusting.\n\n- Mr\\_Avenger\n- Aug 7, 2022\n- Permalink\n\n### Interesting look at mental health issues.\n\nMORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.com\n\nThis kdrama was pretty interesting. It had a more adult content especially with the topic involved. Mental health are the main part of the story. Most of the characters had issues they had to deal with. It was interesting to see them deal with what they have. The bond that the four main character developed was enjoyable to watch. Jae-yeol and Hae-soo's relationship was adorable and had a more adult perspective. They had to face many challenges and it was entertaining to see how things would unfold. I had issues with some scenes because it seemed like to lack coherency.\n\n- erikacunanan29\n- Jul 11, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### Watch it...just shut up and watch it\n\nI guess the most natural......close to reality show\n1. Guy is a cutie\n2. Girl is real...doesnt try to become cute/likable\n3. Side characters could have been more developed...but okay\n\nThe eye popping moment when you realize the plot!!!!! I mean....i went 'WHAT???????'\n\nDidn't see that coming!!!!\n\nA must watch!!!!\n\n- sakshiagarwal900\n- Jun 7, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Do not miss it\n\nKorea is always making good medical drama. This is no exception.\n\nI think a lot of reseach has been done on mental illness and illusion. I like the friendly way the female lead, a psychiatry, handles the figure in illusion.\n\nThe beautiful soundtrack never leave my mind.\n\n- madbird-61243\n- Dec 27, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### An Eye Opener...\n\nThis series is definitely one of the funniest series out there. The whole cast itself from the start gives you that laughter will have a strong presence in this series. However, I have to say I enjoyed the romance between the two leads especially. Precisely, around the period where Jo In-Sung's character was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His journey to recovery was not an easy one and times frightening to see. The things people go through is just something that brings tears to my eyes. To see the trauma and how powerful its presence in someone's life to the point his mind manifests a being is really a painful experience. The writer did a great job with this series. The series is both entertaining and informative. The series also deals with other patients within the main cast and their lives with their respective mental illnesses. Quite an eye opener. A must watch!!!\n\n- Chaokage\n- Aug 7, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Are you really ok ?\n\nThe story of a love affair between a Psychiatrist and a successful writer. Both parties have mental health issues due to events in their past. Can their love overcome these issues as well as the serious family problems both have. The Psychiatrist is played by Hyo-Jin Kong who is superb in her role and the male lead In-Sung Jo is also convincing. The story mainly centres around the hospital and tries to highlight how ostracised a person can be because of their illness. A physical injury is visible and easily understood unlike mental illness which people tend to shun as it is not so easy to interpret. An enjoyable series with interesting side characters.\n\n- alaningle7\n- Sep 22, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Makes you think.\n\nNot since queen of the classroom (Japanese version),has a drama made me think the way this one has.

This is not a typical korean melodrama. I went into this expecting a fluffy romantic comedy, and there was much, much more to this than I expected. There are <Themes>themes</Themes> (I won't spoil them for you) that add quite the depth to the romance and the comedy. Still, when it wants to be fun and light-hearted, it is, while never feeling sugarcoated. And it also never falls into the expected melodrama of most korean drama. In the last few episodes, I was quite impressed by how powerful some scenes were (scenes I did not expect at first, and then dreaded later on because I fear consistently melodrama). Yet, this show is able to pull out the wealth of emotions from a scene without ever feeling cheesy, cliché or meek. From beginning to end, this show is on point. It has its own identity and it is worth watching. Especially for the wonderful acting of every single character on this show. Every single actor plays incredibly well, and mostly, every character is deeply interesting. I tried to do this review while shying away from anything that could spoil it for you, but, unless you are looking for a thriller-adventure TV show at the moment, I don't see how you could not love this. This is a korean classic and do not look over this one only because it has only a few people who rated this. It will become known over here soon enough, I'm sure.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"Reviewer\": \"cremea\",\n                \"Review\": \"Pretty solid Korean TV melodrama! <Name>It's Okay, It's Love</Name>: 2014 Korean TV melodrama, 16 episodes. Story: Relationship adverse psychiatrist meets popular playboy novelist. They are seemingly mismatched for one another, but they end up having to live together as roommates due to some contrived circumstances. They soon start to develop feelings for one another, and thus, another K-drama love story is underway. If the story sounds familiar to you, well, of course it does; many of these K-drama shows invoke the same basic story being retold again & again with just slight variations. This show involves two thirty-some year old leads that fall in love and try to stay in love, overcome obstacles along the way, and eventually try to find some peace or happiness at the end of it all regardless of what happens. For these shows to work, all you really need is some experienced leads and some decent writing, and, you need to keep the show at a minimal number of episodes that include enough interesting auxiliary characters and side stories to keep everything moving along when the lead love story isn't the focal point. This particular show, while nowhere near the best K-drama I've seen, accomplishes enough of the aforementioned ingredients to be above satisfactory at the very least. Aside from the love story, the overall <Themes>theme</Themes> of this show focuses on the general healing of past & present emotional wounds among the characters. Along with the female lead, 2 of the secondary cast members are also psychiatrists, and many of the side stories occur in a hospital dealing with random patients that need some help. The psychiatrists aren't much better off than some of their patients though, and the same goes for everyone else on this show, as they all have their own deep-seated personal problems to reconcile (some more than others). Most of the interaction with the patients is just window dressing & filler, as the docs diagnose a different disorder for each weekly new patient, then fix 'em up and send them on their way. Don't expect to gain any deep insight about the field of psychiatry when you watch this show; it's pretty clear the writers and cast are just winging it as best they can after briefly perusing a Psychiatry for Dummies book.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"Reviewer\": \"fake_moviestar\",\n                \"Review\": \"Pleasantly Surprised! I generally dislike older k-dramas, but I heard good things about this show and decided to give it a shot. What a pleasant surprise! This show has more mature <Themes>themes</Themes> and plot lines than almost any k drama I have ever seen, but for the most part these were handled maturely. I was particularly taken aback by how good the acting was in this - both the ML and FL were outstanding. I found the FL to be quite irritating for about the first half of the show - spoiled, temperamental, and unfair to the ML most of the time. What was really refreshing was how the ML handled the FL, I absolutely loved his 'give as good as he got' attitude. He was mature but also fair in their interactions. I also thought all the mental illnesses were handled very well! There was a lot of professionalism and realistic portrayals, so I was very impressed with that. A lot of shows (including Hollywood shows in particular) tend to portray mental illness, especially schizophrenia, as an illness that manifests as aggressive and dangerous. I really liked how they showed how most of the time these illnesses are not dangerous to other people, if anyone it's to the patients themselves.

Well, this is definitely one of the best Kdramas I have seen in a while. I don't even like calling IOTL a k drama but I'd rather prefer calling it a Korean show. It was simply amazing. I will recommend it to everyone. I am not a doctor, so I can't say how aptly the psychiatric aspect of the show was portrayed. But, I want to point out how nicely the show was written and the different characters were interwoven with each other. The show was 6 at the beginning, but as the story moved on it kept on getting better and better and by the 12th episode, it got to 10. The actors did an extraordinary job. The main actor was outstanding. His character was so vulnerable at one point and he acted that part so beautifully, I can't even. The main actress, her dressing sense was so good. Her character was irritating at times but she can't help it as the character was written that way and she acted really well as well. TBH all the characters did an amazing job. The kisses were so real and felt raw. Those kinds of kisses are difficult to find in kdramas. And finally the OST. It was so good and the songs were played on such needed moments. 'Let me go, I don't wanna be your HERO', that song gave me goosebumps every time it was played on the show. All in all, it was definitely one of the best Korean Shows.\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"Reviewer\": \"estheriroro\",\n                \"Review\": \"Perfection! I am already a Korean drama addict so I love all the cheesiness and the puppy love often displayed in Korean dramas. I went into this drama thinking the same way especially because of the cheesy title but boy was I wrong. The plot, actors, acting and the scene of this drama is absolutely beautiful. Zo In Sung and Hyo Jin portray their characters so well that people think they are an item in real life. The plot also gives a refreshing storyline for kdramas as it focuses on such a rare yet very important topic in society. This drama will take you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and at the end will leave you stunned. Another thing I loved was that the end wasn't just random and abrupt but was well put together and beautiful. The writer did such an amazing job. This is my best kdrama now along with 'I can hear your voice'. This is my 2nd time watching it now because I want to notice all the little inner acting and messages I might have missed the first time. lol.

I watched it until the end because I was still curious, but this was depressing and at times disturbing if you've experienced some of those yourself.

The actors fully deliver beautiful acting because often there are one take scenes which feel so natural. The plot & characters are written so well; props to writers & director who made this drama a masterpiece. But one thing I don't like about this drama is that ML's character always talks about how important consent is & how he would never do anything if women say no yet continues to kiss FL without consent; she clearly has issues but somehow her issues are vanished when he kisses her which felt a bit unrealistic.

His journey to recovery was not an easy one and times frightening to see. The things people go through is just something that brings tears to my eyes. To see the trauma and how powerful its presence in someone's life to the point his mind manifests a being is really a painful experience. The writer did a great job with this series.

It’s been 8 to 10 out of 10, so does it mean that I didn’t have the heart to rate a lousy art? Nope, not at all. The sole reason was that I wouldn’t even bother invest my time to write a review on something atrocious (subjectively, solely based on my personal opinion) in the first place. Once I found out that this piece of art wasn’t my cup of tea, I wouldn’t even make an effort to write anything about it.\n\nI have to admit that sometimes I chose to overlook the faulty of an art for the sake of enjoying the art. And everything felt much better and simpler that way, that the beauty of appreciation lies in the lack of judgment and more of understanding. Nonetheless, this time I feel like pinpointing, not nitpicking, some lackluster scenes which could’ve been perfectly wholesome. And the first one on the list is Hi, Bye, Mama!.\n\nHI BYE, MAMA! / 하이바이, 마마! (2020)\n\nThe drama tells about a wandering ghost who came back to life after 5 years since her unfair death due to a traffic accident, leaving his husband Jo Kang Hwa with the born of their daughter who survived the accident. Cha Yu Ri had been watching the growth of her lovely daughter as an invisible ghost, but suddenly reappeared to carry out a reincarnation project that allowed her to become a visible human for 49 days. Her family stayed the same, but her husband had remarried with his junior at the hospital named Oh Min Jung. Her abrupt comeback took everybody around her by surprise and shuddered the life of her family once again.\n\nHi Bye, Mama! was written by Kwon Hye Joo, the same screenwriter who was behind the masterpiece Go Back Couple. Both dramas are somehow on the same page about the meaning of family and parents. Same heartwarming stories, quite similar in feelings but slightly different plot execution.\n\nINITIAL IMPRESSION\n\nWhile the premise of conducting a quest for a second chance to live again in the span of 49 days doesn’t exactly breathe a fresh air in Kdramaland, it is still an interesting and heartrending genre to pull off. I watched an old drama titled 49 Days / 49일 back then in 2011 which hooked me right off the bat till the end of the story. Speaking about the matter of life and death is always thought-provoking but compelling at the same time, for most people only began to realize what truly matters in life by then.\n\nCha Yu Ri (Kim Tae Hee) sparks with bubbly and outgoing traits from the beginning, whether as a person or a ghost. Albeit her characterization was kinda inconsistent from time to time, I didn’t think of it as a big deal because we, humans, are arguably the most inconsistent beings on Earth, aren’t we? Regardless, I found Cha Yu Ri quite relatable and had instantly grown fond of her with her daily thoughts and the following actions.\n\nI have never encountered Kim Tae Hee’s drama in a way that allowed me to reminisce the scenes with a special attachment, so I had no idea about her previous acting performances at all. However, she managed to astonish me with how awesome her delivery was. Might also because she herself has just become a baby mother on her own, Kim Tae Hee understands the feelings of a mother well, and portrayed Cha Yu Ri equally well and don’t fight me on this one. Loved her voice also, especially when she was yelling in anger or deep frustration.\n\nAnd I have never seen someone who cries as prettily as this one. Kim Tae Hee is indeed that gorgeous.\n\nJo Kang Hwa (Lee Kyu Hyung) is a righteous chest surgeon in the hospital. He is one of the most sincere male leads in Kdramaland, don’t fight me on this one also. From the glimpse of his past with Yu Ri, he was a loving boyfriend who turned into a loving husband. Nonetheless, Kang Hwa experienced a forceful turnaround after the death of Cha Yu Ri and almost became a completely different person. It was inevitably painful to see him feigning ignorance over everything else while being unable to overcome his guilt for failing to rescue his wife from death. Even after remarrying with a beautiful young wife who loves him just enough, Kang Hwa still kept a hidden space inside his heart for Yu Ri, which actually hindered him from being himself.\n\nHere Lee Kyu Hyung doesn’t have that flower boyish-vibe with him, or that charismatic tsundere-vibe that roam around in almost every Kdrama plot. Instead, he was depicted as an ordinary guy who loves his significant other with devoted affection. Just Kang Hwa being Kang Hwa. I guess. He is just.. kind. Lee Kyu Hyung is perfect for this role and I really like his deep gaze that speaks louder than words.\n\nOh Min Jung (Go Bo Kyul) is portrayed as a nonchalant and introverted young woman who quit her nursery work after getting married with Kang Hwa and became a homemaker for him and Jo Seo Woo, the daughter that Yu Ri left behind. Her character felt quite off at first because I wasn’t so sure of her stance. Min Jung looks gloomy and fragile all the time, like she is in the edge of breaking down in the corner of the room. But then, I believe that she was just too accustomed to keeping things for herself in a reserved manner.\n\nGo Bo Kyul appeared in Go Back Couple as the male lead’s first love at campus. She gives off the pretty-yet-untouchable girl that definitely suits the first-love title. I think she did a wonderful job there, and so did she here. Go Bo Kyul actually looks too young to become a mother, and her utterly soft thin voice also doesn’t help, but I think that’s what the drama aims to showcase: the struggle of a woman that gets married with a widower with a kid, who is putting an effort to adjust with his life and the sudden child-rearing responsibility. But then, she is equally a kind character. This drama is seriously overwhelmed with kind people.\n\nALLURING STUFFS\n\nI would say that the child actor Seo Woo Jin was the first trigger that kept me seated throughout the whole episodes. He was cast to portray a kid of opposite gender due to his so-called resemblance with Kim Tae Hee, and he indeed was adorable enough to play the role of a lovely but gloomy little daughter.\n\nLike this one &lt;33\n\nEP2. I love that the show unravels the past by bits in a serene manner, and that the writer seriously put an effort in composing a solid atmosphere in the first episodes, which was indeed a solid one.\n\n[SPOILERS ALERT]\n\n“Everyone passes through a tunnel of darkness in life. A long tunnel that makes you think that you may never see the light again. But as there are no tunnels without exits, there is no eternal love nor eternal pain in the world.”\n\nThe broken-hearted Kang Hwa had been crumbling so bad ever since Yu Ri left him without words, but Yu Ri’s mother made him raise Seo Woo just so that he could find a reason to live and start over again. But then, death is forever the most sorrowful kind of goodbye. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nEP2. I always love the interaction between Yu Ri and Seo Woo because Yu Ri is the exact copy of every mother on Earth; chatty, sometimes too loud for her own sake, but cares about her family more than anybody else in the world.\n\nEP3. [SPOILERS ALERT] The moment when Kang Hwa bumped into Yu Ri after she came back alive was gold. His eyes spoke thousand mixed feelings bulked inside; confusion, absurdity, but also a genuine yearning amidst the distress. His bewilderment was depicted naturally, but Kang Hwa didn’t hesitate to stop Yu Ri from her escape attempt. He even rented a hotel room and gave his credit card to ensure her comfort and safety. I liked that he knew it right away that it was truly her late wife, as unbelievable as it might seem to be. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nEP5. Seriously, Kang Hwa is one of the sweetest male leads in Kdramaland. [SPOILERS ALERT] I was close to bawling my eyes out during the flashback when Kang Hwa kept coming to the hotel’s receptionist asking him to check on Yu Ri every two hours because, as dumbfounded as he was at that time, he was scared that Yu Ri might suddenly vanish into thin air. [END OF SPOILERS] I am honestly touched with him feeling afraid to lose her for the second time without proper words, then keeping an eye close to her just to ensure her safety.\n\nEP7. I actually liked the scenes between Yu Ri and Jang Pil Seung (Lee Shi Woo), a son of the Jang family who had been wandering off ever since the three of them died  together of a tragic car accident. Despite the huge age difference (Lee Shi Woo is only a 99 liner fyi), their on-screen interactions didn’t put me off. The occasional meetings between the two felt like the start of any love line in Kdramaland. It disappointed me that the writer didn’t bother to develop Pil Seung’s character in spite of his numerous appearances.\n\nEP9. I like that the writer interprets the meaning of a soulmate as somebody whose presence lights the other when things were dark, just like how Yu Ri shone brightly upon Kang Hwa in the past. [SPOILERS ALERT] During the flashback, Kang Hwa was occupied with treacherous despair after Yu Ri passed away. He lost his source of strength and light, which multiplied Yu Ri’s regrets as a ghost. She desperately wished that Kang Hwa would find another source of light even if it wasn’t her and thankfully, he did when he met Min Jung. And this was Yu Ri’s bittersweet smile, knowing that Kang Hwa could finally put a smile on his face albeit because of another woman. Yu Ri couldn’t afford feeling jealous because he thought of Kang Hwa’s happiness first. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nEP10. This drama is surprisingly full of kind people with good intentions, including Min Jung. Her character may occur as tedious due to her lukewarm behavior at times, but she was indeed a kind person. [SPOILERS ALERT] There’s a hole in my heart when Min Jung uttered her own narrative about getting married with Kang Hwa and taking care of his little child. That she could never replace the position of Seo Woo’s biological mother. That she was still lacking no matter what she had done.\n\n“Back then, I was cocky enough to think that there was nothing I couldn’t achieve with effort and passion. But there is a place in life that I can’t achieve or accomplish with my efforts and passion alone.” [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nEP10. Another hole in my heart emerged upon hearing the diagnosis of Kang Hwa’s psychological disorder. About him refusing to get properly treated even after the mourning period had long come to an end.\n\n“The more stable his new marriage got, the guiltier he would’ve felt. Even while laughing and feeling happy, he would’ve felt a sudden pang of guilt. He probably didn’t seek help either because his symptoms were the only reminder of what happened. He wanted to forget nothing.”\n\nJust imagine how ripped apart his heart had been the whole time.\n\nEP12. [SPOILERS ALERT] Every dead person left with a sad story, but the story behind the suicide of Park Hye Jin (Bae Yoon Kyung) especially tugs at my heartstrings. She ended her own life due to relentless bullying at her workplace. She thought that everything would be better if she didn’t exist in the first place. “But then, the moment I killed myself, I regretted it. My dream wasn’t all that I had. Mom, dad, my friends.. I had them in my life too. Why do people always regret things when it’s too late?” [END OF SPOILERS] A friendly reminder that as messed up as we might have been, we are all precious in the eyes of other people who realize our worth. Thus, ending your life before the destined moment comes is never worth-it.\n\nEP14. A little shoutout to how Yu Ri and Go Hyun Jung (Shin Dong Mi) took the meaning of friendship to the next level as far as taking each other’s side no matter what. Hyun Jung tried to be understanding to Yu Ri’s stance and did her best to keep Yu Ri in her memory.\n\nEP14. Kang Hwa is seriously a character that triggers my prolonged sighing throughout the episodes for being awfully kind. [SPOILERS ALERT] From hesitating to get remarried until he chose to live in guilt instead, to being excessively considerate towards Min Jung with the child-rearing responsibilities, and also enduring life while holding onto Yu Ri in his heart, Kang Hwa did everything he could and stacked up the pain to the point of having both Min Jung and Yu Ri voiced it out. That he had to stop pretending to be okay when things were not.\n\nThe most heart-breaking part was when Kang Hwa’s symptoms reappeared 10 minutes after entering the operating room and Yu Ri ran all her might to calm him. Bursting into tears, Kang Hwa let out his resentment and misery in the end. I believe that Yu Ri couldn’t have been more relieved by then. Kang Hwa, too might have been more relieved upon hearing Yu Ri’s words. “Stop blaming yourself. It’s not your fault.” [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nEP15. Just like Ma Jin Joo from Go Back Couple and her lingering regrets for not spending more time with her mother, Yu Ri also stuck around her mother a lot when she came back home. When asked if she was upset for losing her place as Kang Hwa’s wife and Seo Woo’s mother, Yu Ri replied, “I still have you, Mom. You are mine and will be mine forever. I had you when I was born, alive and dead. You had always been mine.” There’s a strong feeling of relief that no matter what happens, there will always be a person who stands by me and takes my side, and that person is my mother.\n\nSTUFFS THAT IRKED ME\n\nOver my years of watching Kdramas, it’s crystal clear that it’s best to leave out some petty criticisms especially in fantasy dramas like this. It’s useless to fight over several inconsistent logic the writers throw at the viewers because, at the end of the day, everything is fictitious. Including the oddness, I guess.\n\nOverwhelming side stories\n\nI feel that most dramas are always like this, where side characters also get their own stories written delightfully to find justice or proper closure to mark their finals. The hit ghost drama Master’s Sun or Hotel del Luna also wrote about side characters a lot and made several heartwarming ones. This drama, too, wrote some tear-jerking side stories about the ghosts. However, I feel that some of them were messily executed and a bit uncalled-for, [SPOILERS ALERT] like the part when ghosts voiced their raging jealousy towards Yu Ri, who managed to be alive again, by singing out loud the song of angry ghosts in the charnel house. Also about running after Yu Ri to ask her to grant their wish. Many of them seem like unnecessary scenes to my eyes. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nSeo Woo’s unresolved development problems\n\nThe initial episode already revealed Seo Woo’s lacking cognitive development for children her age, presumably resulted from the shortfall of Kang Hwa and Min Jung’s parenting. There was Min Jung’s effort to take Seo Woo to the psychiatrist to oversee her growth. There was Yu Ri’s effort to chase the ghosts away and talk to her in daily basis. There was Kang Hwa who knew exactly what was wrong with his daughter. But oddly enough, there was no progress nor talks of frustration about her lacking development. Seo Woo was still the same as she was in the first episodes, except that she smiled a bit more often. And then, boom! The teenage Seo Woo grew up just like any regular teenager ever found.\n\nWeak reasoning, endless questions and cliffhangers that left me freakin‘ hanging\n\nThis one is quite a pity because I expected nothing but the best from the ideas who produced Go Back Couple back then, but some plot holes here are indeed worth-mentioning. [SPOILERS ALERT] The whole commotion began with Yu Ri’s reappearance in human form and her 49-day “judgement” period to find her place back, to which she declined right away because she only wanted Seo Woo to stop seeing ghosts and didn’t want to be consumed by greed.\n\nSome other questions that I had to list down because I just couldn’t find an answer to satisfy my curiosity:\n\n- Before her death, Yu Ri had given a name to the fetus inside her stomach. She kept calling it Yeol Moo, a name Kang Hwa must have known about. It might not mean much, but I would like to know why he decided to give a different name upon the childbirth.\n- How is it possible that Yu Ri had no idea about Seo Woo’s allergy to strawberries when, in fact, she had practically lived with Kang Hwa’s family for 5 years? Yu Ri herself even understood Min Jung’s alcohol taste, so it didn’t make sense that she knew nothing about her kid.\n- As an office worker myself, I couldn’t get why Yu Ri managed to get hired as a kitchen assistant at the playground by going with a different name without an ID verification. I mean, it is very unlikely that a playground doesn’t do background check on their worker. I assumed that it would be different from those regular odd jobs going around, wouldn’t it?\n- There’s this exorcist who made an appearance out of nowhere with a high success rate of sending ghosts away from the world. It was said that he came to that area due to Shaman Mi Dong’s constant failures in sending up the ghosts on her own. This exorcist was definitely so eager to turn Seo Woo into a shaman and he kept chasing her unreasonably. But why? And when Yu Ri made up her mind to sacrifice her second chance in order to protect Seo Woo, suddenly he vanished from the screen without words. Just why? Frankly speaking, the conflicts felt kinda weak compared to the ones in Go Back Couple.\n\nFinally, the closure itself was such a pity because I thought the reason why Yu Ri had to ascend after all the sluggish troubles and struggles was somehow still lacking. I didn’t mind Yu Ri going up because she was originally a ghost, but the reason behind is weaker than what I had expected. It might have been more solid if Yu Ri insisted on going up herself, instead of being forcefully sent up in exchange of Seo Woo’s sixth sense.\n\n[END OF SPOILERS]\n\nLOVELINES ALERT\n\nCha Yu Ri &amp; Jo Kang Hwa\n\nAs spouses who were once deeply in love with each other, I could feel the overwhelming chemistry and love between the two, be it at the present time or during their flashbacks. Sparkling gazes, wide smiles, tingling laughter and natural banters were all I need to get hooked into their lovey-dovey moments.\n\nSoon after, the jubilant time passed and Kang Hwa never truly recovered from the  tormenting agony. He was someone who would rather live in guilt for as long as he could remember Yu Ri, thinking that he didn’t deserve an ounce of happiness after sending her away. Which made it so heartrending to see his sincere desperation and yearning once he saw Yu Ri again.\n\n[SPOILERS ALERT] When Kang Hwa managed to discover the fact that Yu Ri had been tagging along with him all along, the first thing he did was running to her while bursting into tears, deeply apologizing for being happy again with another woman, to which Yu Ri replied that it’s okay for Kang Hwa to finally let her go. That it’s okay for him to pursue his happiness. To forget her and live a happy life without burden. [END OF SPOILERS] This heartfelt sincerity is never outdated, which made me root for their happiness even more.\n\nTowards the end of her leaving, it put a motherly smile on my face as Kang Hwa breathed a sigh of relief saying, “I will remember you. I will only cherish our happy moments.”\n\nJo Kang Hwa &amp; Oh Min Jung\n\nWriting about the relationship between Kang Hwa and Min Jung got me conflicted at first because I wasn’t so convinced with their couple. Their interactions felt like summoning two introverted strangers in the same room, not exactly memorable nor appealing to my eyes. I couldn’t perceive Kang Hwa’s consideration and care as love at first, or maybe it was me who was getting too immersed with the chemistry between the main leads. It feels hard to connect with her character because she just doesn’t feel that real. Or that she just doesn’t relinquish enough human emotions for me to relate with her feelings.\n\nAfter so many episodes, thankfully, Min Jung spoke up about the ordeal inside her heart. When her anger finally blew up, relating to her agony became much easier. [SPOILERS ALERT] After Min Jung learned about Yu Ri’s identity, she became completely lost in dismay as if her world totally fell apart before her. From then, her poignant woes were all vivid to my heart as Min Jung finally delivered her true human emotions.\n\nAlthough this couple is rather pale in comparison with Kang Hwa and Yu Ri’s relationship, they managed to define love in their own way. It made me realize how genuine Min Jung’s feelings were when she made up her mind to leave Kang Hwa so that he could reunite with Yu Ri, to which Kang Hwa didn’t retort or say anything. And it broke her even more. [END OF SPOILERS]\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nRegardless of the flaws, the drama was polished with beautiful after-thoughts and poignant closures. Stories about family never fail to deliver a heart-rending message referring to the most important treasure on Earth, family. Contrary to the present popular belief about putting yourself as the leader of your own life, this drama is strongly-attached to the common Asian family values.\n\n“There is a reason why you should live an honest life. Your life is not only yours, but also your parents’.”\n\nI used to yearn for the day of my own freedom, which comes from financial independence and liberty from family; their expectations and restrictions. I used to see family as too demanding, too vexatious and too exhausting to deal with. As I grow older, I began to recognize my family from a different perspective, that they are the only safe shelter from the frigid world. I work my fingers to the bone and try to lead a genuine life because I believe that my success and happiness become the pride of my parents. And thank God, as impaired as it is, my family also has become a tranquil home to live in. One of the most memorable quotes from this drama tells me a lot how unconditional is parental love.\n\n“A child who lost his parents is called an orphan, but why isn’t there any term to refer to a parent who lost his child? Because there aren’t any words enough to describe the excruciating pain.”\n\nLastly, this drama encourages people to live their life as if it was their last day on Earth; full of gratitude and kindness while cherishing people so dear to them. There’s no guarantee that tomorrow will come like today, and once we realize that fact, being nice will never become any easier. My last thought goes to the answer of Kang Hwa’s attitude towards Min Jung during their marriage life all along. He was being severely considerate and thoughtful unlike how common spouses are supposed to be just because he no longer wanted to have lingering regrets like what he did with Yu Ri.\n\n“I didn’t want to have regrets again. I should’ve been nicer, I should’ve granted her wish, I should’ve held back. I didn’t want to repeat such regrets.”\n\nIs is worth-checking out? Definitely yes. The overall tone of the show is heartwarming like no other and everything is depicted beautifully in spite of the flaws. I am content enough with the heartfelt messages delivered. Lots of tears and hurting, but I am thankful for what it has taught me.\n\nFinal epilogue\n\n“When you go to Heaven, God will ask you two questions. If you answer yes to both questions, you can be reborn as a human in your next life.\n\nOne question is, were you happy with your life?\n\nThe other question is, were other people happy because of you?“\n\nGRADE\n\n7/10\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Published by sapphired17\n\nJust a little fangirl of Korean dramas, who's over the fangirl period for DBSK and Super Junior.

It’s been 8 to 10 out of 10, so does it mean that I didn’t have the heart to rate a lousy art? Nope, not at all. The sole reason was that I wouldn’t even bother to invest my time to write a review on something atrocious (subjectively, solely based on my personal opinion) in the first place. \n        </Introduction>\n        \n        <PlotSummary>\n            The drama tells about a wandering ghost who came back to life after 5 years since her unfair death due to a traffic accident, leaving her husband Jo Kang Hwa with the birth of their daughter who survived the accident. Cha Yu Ri had been watching the growth of her lovely daughter as an invisible ghost, but suddenly reappeared to carry out a reincarnation project that allowed her to become a visible human for 49 days. Her family stayed the same, but her husband had remarried with his junior at the hospital named Oh Min Jung. Her abrupt comeback took everybody around her by surprise and shuddered the life of her family once again.\n        </PlotSummary>\n        \n        <InitialImpression>\n            While the premise of conducting a quest for a second chance to live again in the span of 49 days doesn’t exactly breathe fresh air in Kdramaland, it is still an interesting and heartrending genre to pull off. \n        </InitialImpression>\n        \n        <CharacterAnalysis>\n            <Character>\n                <Name>Cha Yu Ri</Name>\n                <Actor>Kim Tae Hee</Actor>\n                <Description>Cha Yu Ri sparks with bubbly and outgoing traits from the beginning, whether as a person or a ghost. Albeit her characterization was kinda inconsistent from time to time, I found her quite relatable.</Description>\n            </Character>\n            <Character>\n                <Name>Jo Kang Hwa</Name>\n                <Actor>Lee Kyu Hyung</Actor>\n                <Description>Jo Kang Hwa is a righteous chest surgeon in the hospital. He is depicted as an ordinary guy who loves his significant other with devoted affection.</Description>\n            </Character>\n            <Character>\n                <Name>Oh Min Jung</Name>\n                <Actor>Go Bo Kyul</Actor>\n                <Description>Oh Min Jung is portrayed as a nonchalant and introverted young woman who became a homemaker for Kang Hwa and Jo Seo Woo, the daughter that Yu Ri left behind.</Description>\n            </Character>\n        </CharacterAnalysis>\n        \n        <ThemesExplored>\n            The drama explores themes of family, loss, and the emotional struggles of its characters, particularly focusing on the impact of grief and the quest for second chances.\n        </ThemesExplored>\n        \n        <FinalThoughts>\n            Regardless of the flaws, the drama was polished with beautiful after-thoughts and poignant closures. Stories about family never fail to deliver a heart-rending message referring to the most important treasure on Earth, family.\n        </FinalThoughts>\n    </Content>\n</Review>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the key attributes from the ADT are clearly tagged. The essence of the original article is preserved, and the relevant information is organized under appropriate sections.",

It aired on tvN from December 14, 2019 to February 16, 2020, every Saturday and Sunday at 21:00 (KST). It is also available  for streaming on Netflix.\n\nAt the time of airing, Crash Landing on You became the highest-rated tvN series and the second highest-rated series in Korean cable television history in both viewership ratings and number of viewers.[6]\n\n## Premise\n\nYoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) is a successful South Korean businesswoman and chaebol heiress. One day, while paragliding in Seoul, she is blown off course by a tornado and crash-lands in the North Korean portion of the DMZ. Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), a member of the North Korean elite and a captain in the Korean People's Army is patrolling and discovers Se-ri. He is persuaded to hide her and help her return to the South.\n\n## Plot\n\nOne day, while Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) is paragliding in Seoul, a sudden tornado blows her off course and knocks her out. She awakens to find her paraglide hanging in a tree in a forest in the North Korean portion of the DMZ. There she meets Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), who eventually gives her shelter and develops plans to help her return to South Korea secretly. Over time, they fall in love, despite the divide between their respective countries.\n\nBack in South Korea, Yoon Se-ri's family suppresses the news of her disappearance, fearing it will depress the stock price of Queens Group. Just before Se-ri went missing, her retiring father had told his family that he intended to make her his successor, based on her ability as a businesswoman, which she proved by building her own company, Seri's Choice. Her half-brothers, Yoon Se-jun (Choi Dae-hoon) and Yoon Se-hyung (Park Hyung-soo), each hoped to be their father's replacement but they have struggled to manage the subsidiaries under their control. The brothers are supported by equally-ambitious wives, Do Hye-ji (Hwang Woo-seul-hye) and Go Sang-ah (Yoon Ji-min), respectively. In Se-ri's absence, Se-hyung uses unscrupulous means to win the succession battle, while his wife Sang-ah attempts to take over Se-ri's Choice.\n\nSe-ri and Jeong-hyeok's story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan (Seo Ji-hye) and Gu Seung-jun (Kim Jung-hyun). Dan is the sophisticated daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying the cello in Russia for several years but returns to marry Jeong-hyeok, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage though they have only met a few times. As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths more than once with Gu Seung-jun, who has fled to North Korea (with the protection of corrupt North Korean officials) in order to escape the pursuit of Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of funds.\n\nThe first half of the story (episodes 1–9) follows Jeong-hyeok's attempts to hide Se-ri and facilitate her return to South Korea. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang (Oh Man-seok), a corrupt and ruthless officer from the Ministry of State Security, who previously arranged the murder of Jeong-hyeok's elder brother, an officer who tried to expose him for crimes against the North Korean regime. Jeong-hyeok's attachment to Se-ri distresses not only Dan, his fiancée, but also his father, a high-ranking political figure. If it became known that Jeong-hyeok harbored a South Korean citizen, it could be used by rival officials to ruin their family.\n\nIn the second half of the story (episodes 10–16), Se-ri has returned to South Korea and resumes leadership of her company, surprising her family and others who had thought her dead. Cheol-gang is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment but escapes custody and infiltrates South Korea to go after Se-ri for revenge. Jeong-hyeok goes to South Korea to protect Se-ri from Cheol-gang. His subordinates follow, sent to Seoul by his father to retrieve him. Meanwhile, in North Korea, despite hostile initial encounters, Dan and Seung-jun fall in love and she shelters him when corrupt officers betray him to Se-hyung's gangsters.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe cast of

In addition, the North Korean lapel pins used by North Korean characters were one third smaller than their actual size.[20] Props manager Joo Dong-man said the crew did not have a \"guidebook on multiple hurdles he had to hop over — skillfully and delicately — to accurately depict the country while dodging criticism\" and, thus, had to be careful \"not to misrepresent the state\". Their research was also guided by North Koreans living in South Korea.[3][19]\n\nThe first script reading took place on July 31, 2019, in Sangam-dong, Seoul, and filming overseas started at the end of August 2019.[21] North Korean scenes were shot in South Korea and Mongolia.[3] Scenes that took place in Switzerland were shot on location.[3] The village of Iseltwald, one such location, experienced a tourism boom as a result.[22][23]\n\n## Original soundtrack\n\n| Crash Landing on You (Original Television Soundtrack)

International response\n\nCrash Landing on You was a huge success in China. The hashtag for the final episode received over 460 million views on Weibo.[41]\n\nThe show was also popular in Japan[14] during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic via Netflix.[42][43] While the Korean Wave is a historically prominent component of media within Japan, Crash Landing on You has been especially influential there, in part due to its portrayal of daily life in North Korea.[42] The series was featured on Japanese-Netflix's top 10 for 69 consecutive weeks.[44]\n\nIn the Philippines, many viewers noted similarities between the plot line and the political narrative of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.[45]\n\nIn the United States, Variety named Crash Landing on You one of \"The Best International Shows on Netflix\",[46] and one of the \"Best International TV Series of 2020\".[47] Time also ranked it as one of the best Korean dramas on Netflix.[48] Jo Walker of The Guardian's \"Stream Team\" called it \"addictively off-the-wall, heartbreaking and hilarious.\"[49] Adella Suliman and Stella Kim of NBC News also suggested that the drama \"features all the ingredients a viewer could wish for\" and has \"drawn a global audience of millions, many no doubt searching for entertainment as they while away their time in coronavirus-related lockdowns\".[50]\n\nAl Jazeera stated that it is a Hallyu success.[51]\n\n### Representation of and reception in South and North Korea\n\n#### General\n\nAlthough the series is a work of fiction, it has received positive reviews from North Korean defectors for its depiction of everyday life in North Korea. At the same time, some details, such as the availability of food, relatively warm behavior of the army and the ease with which the characters cross the border have been criticized.[52][20][17][53][50] Kim Ah-ra, one of the extras who portrayed a North Korean villager, is a writer and actress from North Korea who states that she felt \"like [she] was actually back in a North Korean village\".[53]\n\nKwak Moon-wan, a North Korean defector, who had served with the Supreme Guard Command (which protects the ruling Kim family) worked as an adviser for the series, providing the writers with details about life in North Korea as well as North Korean governmental agencies that added credibility to the show.[54] He acknowledged some of the criticism, admitting that he has taken liberties with the depiction of North Korea (such as not mentioning food shortages), but rejected the claim that he was glamorizing the regime or drawing a false equivalence, saying that the show also depicted some of the darker aspect of life under the regime, such as the issue of kotjebi (child homelessness) and the frequent power cuts. Some North Korean refugees, such as Chun Hyo-jin, who defected from the border village of Hyesan at the age of nineteen, tend to agree: \"Even if what they say, that it glamorizes North Korea, is true, would they choose to live there? I don't think so.\" Even though the drama leaves political matters aside, which are essential to the North Korea issue as she sees it, she says it still is of great significance: \"Its depiction of North Korea is a bit far from reality, but it has made the people interested in North Korea.\"[55] The drama's producer Lee Jung-hyo said during a press conference in Seoul in December: \"I know some people are uncomfortable about our subject, North Korea, but we don't portray a wholly authentic North Korea in our drama. Most settings are closer to a fantasy, although some aspects do reflect real North Korean life.\"[56]\n\nKang Na-ra, a North Korean defector who advised the show's production team, stated that about 60% of North Korea's depiction in the show is accurate:[57] \"The richer families in North Korea like to show off their wealth by adding lace curtains to their windows. So that was pretty well portrayed.\" She also appreciated the detail about kimchi caves: \"Since rural North Korea doesn't get electricity, they don't have refrigerators. They have kimchi caves where they store kimchi, and that was also recreated well.\"[58] House checks are also a regular affair. She revealed that she once had to hide inside a furnace at the house of the broker who helped her escape in order to avoid detection. In the drama, the heiress has to hide in the kimchi storage area when security forces come knocking one night. As depicted in the drama, North Koreans are allowed to choose only from a fixed list of hair styles — 18 for women and 28 for men. Kang said that \"there's a punishment for you if you don't comply\" in an interview with YouTube channel DKDKTV.[59] On the other hand, as she explained in a YouTube video, the characters were able to slip across the border much more easily than in real life: \"I had to pay a broker 10 million won (US$8,400) to swim across the Yalu river [which borders North Korea and China] while being shot at from behind by soldiers [when I escaped].\"[60] Cartoonist Choi Seong-guk, who defected to the South in 2011, also said the drama set is 60% accurate. The portrayal of jangmadang, or local markets where all kinds of goods, including imports from South Korea, are sold is especially real, he told The Sunday Times. However, he felt that the drama \"glamorized the soldiers too much, almost to an uncomfortable extent\". He said North Korean men enter the military when they are 17 and serve for 10 to 13 years, and \"during this time, they are...ruthless and harsh, robbing homes and raping women at night\".[59] Still, he hopes the drama will make its way to North Korea and go viral: \"I hope the North Koreans who see this drama will realize how positively the South Koreans think of them and learn to change.\"[59]\n\nThere were also critical responses to the themes of the drama in both regions. In January 2020, The Christian Liberal Party (CLP) filed a complaint in South Korea against tvN at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, accusing the network of glamorizing North Korea through this series, in violation of the National Security Law.[61][62][unreliable source?][63] Then, in March 2020, a few North Korean media outlets criticized unnamed South Korean programs and films that explored relations between North and South Korea. While Crash Landing on You was not directly mentioned by the media outlets, it was perceived to be among the referenced works. Another is the 2019 film Ashfall, although that film was also not directly cited in the articles.[64][65]\n\n#### Scholarship\n\nStephen Epstein (Victoria University of Wellington) and Christopher Green (Leiden University) suggest that while Crash Landing on You is formulaic, it also \"is a crucial text for evaluating ongoing change in South Korean popular representations of its neighbour. Indeed, given the concerted use of North Korean backdrops in Crash Landing on You and the size and global extent of its audiences, the show is likely the most noteworthy South Korean popular culture representation of North Korea yet produced.\"[66] Yun Suk-jin, a professor at Chungnam National University concurs, noting that the series \"changed the stereotypes on North Korea and candidly showed that it too is a place where people live\".[53] Sarah A. Son, lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Sheffield also agrees, noting that Crash Landing on You responds to the \"socio-cultural divide\" between the North and the South, which academic scholarship cites as one of the biggest obstacles to future unification. Son argues that \"through the re-framing of stereotypes, albeit with some creative licence, Crash Landing on You arguably humanises the North for its audience in ways that inter-Korean dialogue has not in recent years. Despite its soft-focus romanticisation of the political situation, Crash Landing on You brings the pain of the division to a personal level for a generation of Koreans who, unlike their grandparents, have no memory of what it was like to be a single nation.\"[18]\n\nJoanna Elfving-Hwang, associate professor of Korean Studies at the University of Western Australia notes that \"North Korea tends to appear in our imagination as the 'axis of evil', we think of [negative things like] nuclear weapons and human rights abuses...this drama has dared to think about North Korean people differently and represented them as quite human and quite Korean\".[60] Steve Hung Lok-wai, a Korean Affairs expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong states that the drama sidestepped larger political issues through a narrative that did not end with the male lead's defection: \"Lots of people questioned whether the male lead, the North Korean soldier, would end up defecting to the South for love, but they were able to sidestep that scenario and gave it a plausible ending where the two would meet in Switzerland.\" This, he argues, is \"quite smart because they avoided all the real taboos but made it believable enough where it would make people think about these political problems\".[60] John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University, praised the series for its decision to draw parallels between powerful families in both the South and the North, and to humanize North Koreans beyond generic stereotypes.[67]\n\n### Viewership\n\nThe series was a huge rating success in South Korea despite airing on tvN, a cable channel/pay TV, which normally has a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS). It is currently the fourth highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history.[68] The final episode's ratings made it the second highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history at that time, overtaking fellow tvN dramas Reply 1988 and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, until it was finally surpassed by JTBC's The World of the Married and Reborn Rich.[69]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|

The tension was high throughout. Totally  did not see the coma guy being the accomplice, so that was a good twist, and he made for a very scary villain. . Plus for once it was the FL lead saving the ML, instead of the other way around, but both characters still managed to be essential to the plot and contribute to solving the big questions of the drama.\n\nRomance: A lot of the drama is the FL lead doubting the ML, and learning to trust him again. The tension and the heartbreak is excellently done.\n\nSkinship: So much more than we usually get in dramas! The chemistry between these two was great.\n\nCrying Scenes: Really hit or miss, personally. There were a few scenes that really got me, but also a couple other where I felt nothing and was like \"okay, can we stop wailing already?\" I especially disliked the ML's crying scenes, because he cried a TON in the second half of the drama, when in the first half he was so stoic and it just seemed weird for him to go from like zero emotions to wailing. I was expecting a little more subdued crying?\n\nSecondary Characters:\n\n- I wish they had included the daughter a bit more!! Kind of felt like she got forgotten there in the middle...I kept thinking about how she's going to be so traumatized when she grows up, lol! The makings of a new drama already.\n- That one police detective who she works with! Absolutely loved him. When you first meet him in the first episode, you think he's going to be a total a**hole, but it turns out he's actually not only a really excellent detective, but he really cares about his team and doesn't hold back when necessary.\n- The mom character. She cried a great deal too much for me to really like her, but her obvious moral conflict throughout really added some complexity to the situation. The doctor dad was pretty 2D, but you could tell that she really loved her son and it hurt her so much that he was literally a serial killer. My mom has told me in the past that one of her greatest fears is that one of her kids who grow up to be a predatory person who intentionally harms and takes advantage of other people, and so I thought of her when watching this character struggle with how to love her son best.\n\nFavorite Scene: Overall loved episodes 4-6, when FL first begins to suspect her husband. The scene where the ML and FL fight in the warehouse and then she finds his watch afterwards especially. ANd then the desperate search for the ML, the whole pool scene--so intense!!\n\nEnding: Amnesia?????!! Okay, then! Honestly felt like the final episode was like a whole new drama, sort of? But I really enjoyed it. I did appreciate how having him forget his memory allowed us to see his \"true self.\" So much of the drama I was trying to guess when he was being genuine and when he was lying, and you get the feeling that he doesn't even know himself. So his conflict when he loses his memory in the last ep, and he's like \"Wow, was I really a douchebag who deceived a woman for years?\" is so real, and you can see that he was really conflicted about it. I think that him being more open about his manipulation of other people will ultimately be helpful for his relationship with the FL as well. As someone who has had a friend who was an excellent manipulator, being able to trust that this person was not going to manipulate me was essential to our friendship. That said, I do hope that eventually he regains his memory.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.5 to 9/10. Though the excitement dipped a bit in the middle, this drama kept me, a chronic drama dropper (though I'm working to change that), glued to the screen from start to finish. The mixing of romance and thriller was just prime. I don't usually go in for thriller/crime/serial killer dramas as a genre, but because I heard the romance was good, I gave this a go. So glad I did! The main tension of the show is definitely that slow building/breaking of trust between the two leads, but in the context of this life or death situation the stakes are just so much higher. Plus the fact that they are married makes the \"can I really trust you when you've lied to me?\" aspect so much more intense.\n\nOverall, highly recommend to people looking for an exciting drama binge that perfectly blends romance and a police/serial killer plot. My docked points are mostly for the crying scenes and forgetting about the daughter for so long.\n\nWould love to hear other people's thoughts! Did you like the ending? Did the crying annoy you as much as it annoyed me?

Seriously, I even tried to practice drama amnesia, and forget that I knew anything about this story world, going in.\n\nThe reason I wanted to do that, was because I wanted to be able to review Show as a standalone drama, particularly for readers who haven’t watched SOOD, and therefore don’t actually care whether Show matches up to its source material.\n\nThese folks just want to know if this show is worth watching, right, and what I think Show does well, etc.\n\nWell.. that watch approach didn’t work out so well, because, as it turns out, it’s basically impossible (for me, at least) to pretend that the source material doesn’t exist, while watching this show. 😅\n\nAnd so, I realize that I just can’t make it such that this review will be equally helpful to those who’ve watched SOOD, and those who haven’t.\n\nSorry. 😬\n\nIn the end, I’ve chosen to talk about this show from the perspective of someone who’s watched SOOD – because, well, that’s the truth – and while I will talk about what Show does well and all that, I feel it’s only fair to warn you upfront, that I will also be discussing this show in the light of SOOD, quite a bit.\n\nWhich is why I thought I’d begin by talking about whether I thought this remake was necessary, and whether it brings value to the story of SOOD.\n\nThen I’ll talk about how to manage your expectations going into this one, and what viewing lens would be most helpful.\n\nAnd then, I’ll talk about various aspects of the show, and I will make comparisons to SOOD, where I think it’s useful to do so.\n\nIf you’re interested in my blow-by-blow reactions, &amp;/or in all the various Patreon members’ comments during the course of our watch, you might like to check out my episode notes on Patreon here.\n\n#### WAS THIS REMAKE NECESSARY?\n\nThis is a question that I heard bandied about quite a lot, by fans of SOOD, pretty soon after A Time Called You aired.\n\nAnd so naturally, this was a question that I chewed on for a fair while, during my watch, so that I could try to figure out an answer to this question that felt authentic to me.\n\nUltimately, even though Show doesn’t manage to recapture the magic that was SOOD, I do think that it’s a worthwhile remake, for the simple reason that the remake makes the story more accessible.\n\nFirst, it makes the story accessible to folks who only consume kdramas, and thus would very likely never check out SOOD anyway, because they’re just not into Taiwanese dramas.\n\nSecond, it makes the story accessible to folks who consume dramas casually, because while I get that part of SOOD’s charm was that it gave us so much to process with the way it dropped information and clues, I understand that this can be alienating for some viewers.\n\nNot everyone likes to dedicate full attention to a drama while watching, and that’s perfectly understandable. I get that a lot of people put on dramas as something to multitask to, rather than as something to give their full focus to.\n\nAlso, it’s entirely possible that some viewers actually have difficulty keying in to SOOD’s style of dropping scattered information, and then piecing it together.\n\nThis remake solves these issues by making the details easier to follow and digest (more on that later, where I talk about how Show does that).\n\nIn the end, I feel that I should consider this remake an in-principle win, because it makes this story – which I love – more accessible to more viewers.\n\nBetter to enjoy a decent remake, rather than miss out on an amazing story altogether, is what I’m thinking.\n\n#### MANAGING EXPECTATIONS / THE VIEWING LENS\n\nHere are a few things that I think would be helpful to keep in mind, to maximize your enjoyment of your watch.\n\n1. Don’t expect Show to be a replica of SOOD\n\nThe original has such a special place in my heart, that I think upon it pretty much as lightning in a bottle; amazing and precious, but near impossible to recreate.\n\nAllowing Show room in your mind, to be what it wants to be, is helpful, I think.\n\n2. Don’t expect the characters to be replicas of their SOOD counterparts\n\nIt helped me to think that these characters exist in a parallel dimension to the original characters from SOOD I know and love.\n\nSo, in my head, they were different people in a different dimension, who find themselves in a similar cycle of events that our SOOD characters went through.\n\nWith this lens in place, the characters have permission in my head, to be different compared to their SOOD counterparts.\n\nAnd so, grumbles that Si Heon isn’t as playful as Ziwei, wouldn’t (or shouldn’t) bother you during your watch.\n\n3. Think of the plot twists as tropes\n\nBecause this is a very twisty story, part of the thrill of watching this story for the first time, is being mind-blown by the twists.\n\nThese same twists will inevitably pack less of a punch, in the remake, if you’ve already seen SOOD.\n\nI found that thinking of the plot twists as tropes, helped me.\n\nLike, sure, it’s not new, but how well is it executed? That’s a good way to approach it, I think, because this way, I feel like we’d all be less likely to blame Show for not feeling exciting, just because we already know the workings of this story.\n\n4. If you haven’t seen SOOD, then go in blind\n\nIf you haven’t already watched SOOD, and are interested in this show, then I would suggest going in blind, to the extent of not even checking out the trailers for this show, because the trailers give too much away.\n\nAlternatively, since you haven’t seen either show, perhaps you’d like to consider watching SOOD instead? because it really is wonderful. 🥹\n\n#### STUFF I LIKED\n\nShow is very pretty to look at\n\nI do have to say, this show is very pretty to look at.\n\nThe intense Spring palette is very pretty, and when combined with actual scenery, like pink blossoms amid greenery, it really, really pops with Pretty.\n\nI have no aversion to Pretty, so this was quite welcome, in my books.\n\nIn particular, I found the high school very beautiful, in an almost surreal way. Like, can high school be this pretty, in real life?\n\nI mean, yes, it’s not very believable that this sprawling, majestic high school exists in this smallish town, but putting that aside, I have to admit that it’s eye-catching and quite gorgeous.\n\nSome things that I feel are improvements on the original\n\nWhile Show does largely align itself with its source material, there are also changes that Show has made.\n\nPersonally, I find that I welcomed some of the changes more than others, so I’ve got them split into three different sections in this review:\n\n1, where I found the changes positive, ie, I found the changes to be an improvement on the original, and then\n\n2, where I felt neutral towards the changes, and finally,\n\n3, where I felt the changes actually had a not-so-great effect on the story that Show was working to tell.\n\nOverall, I do give Show points for being bold to make changes to the original, so that it can be its own thing.\n\nHere the various changes that Show made, which I found to be positive.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1-2. I welcomed the absence of the cartoony office crowd, which was a feature of SOOD (and which is also a feature in almost every Taiwanese drama that features an office).\n\nI’ve gotten used to the cartoony office crowd trope in TW dramas, but that doesn’t mean that I didn’t welcome the absence of it, in this show. 😅\n\nThe office people and antics landed as much more normal in this show, rather than OTT and comical, as was the case in SOOD.\n\nE5-6. When Si Heon becomes cognizant of his feelings for Jun Hee, I really like the gentle manner in which he tells In Gyu about this, and the way he tells In Gyu that he doesn’t want to lie to him.\n\nThis is quite different from the way Ziwei blurts out how he feels towards Yuxuan, to Junjie, in SOOD.\n\nI personally liked this quite a bit, because it demonstrates how important In Gyu is, to Si Heon, and also, how Si Heon is sensitive, mature and considerate.\n\nE5-6. I thought that Show having Min Ju’s attacker be Yeon Jun’s business partner, back in 2023, rather than Jun Hee’s psychiatrist, was a fun touch.\n\nWhat I mean is, fans of SOOD would have fully expected the attacker to have been Jun Hee’s psychiatrist, since the attacker had been Yuxuan’s psychiatrist in the original.\n\nInstead, Show teases us with a cameo of Park Ki Woong as Jun Hee’s psychiatrist – and that’s really such a clever trick, since Park Ki Woong’s acted as some extremely unhinged characters.\n\nAnd thenn. Show surprises us by having a completely different character be the attacker.\n\nI liked that this gave fans of SOOD something to be surprised by.\n\nE5-6. I also like the way Si Heon is shown to meet young Jun Hee.\n\nIt’s pretty cute, and I honestly like Show’s treatment of this meeting more than SOOD’s treatment of it, which I’d found a bit of a stretch, so yay in Show’s favor, even though I have heart-eyes for SOOD forever.\n\nE7-8. I thought it was quite refreshing that In Gyu tells “Min Ju” that if she likes Si Heon, it’s ok if she dates him, because there isn’t a lot of time left, before Si Heon leaves Korea.\n\nI also like the fact that In Gyu and Si Heon actually have a conversation about how In Gyu doesn’t actually feel the same way about Min Ju now, and therefore isn’t actually really upset at hearing that Si Heon likes Min Ju.\n\nAnd, it also makes sense that they conclude that the reason “Min Ju” “made up” all that stuff about being a different person from 2023, in order to heal the rift between them, makes good sense too.\n\nI like the healthier communication dynamic, and I also like the reasoning that the boys use to explain the “made up” story, because it works neatly.\n\nE9-10. I appreciate that Show provides an explanation for why In Gyu’s hearing aid had been found at the place where Min Ju had been attacked.\n\nThis was something that I’m pretty sure SOOD never addressed, and I’m glad that Show provides an answer that makes sense.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nShow gives us some really nice moments\n\nEven though I had some issues with how Show executed certain portions of our story (more on that later), I have to admit that Show managed to serve up some very nice moments.\n\nWhat I’m impressed with, is that I found that I liked these moments, even if those moments were served up in the middle of a stretch where I was actually feeling perplexed about aspects about Show’s delivery.\n\nOr.. maybe that’s my kdrama conditioning coming into play..? 😅\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE7-8. I did very much like the scene closing episode 7, where Si Heon finally runs into Jun Hee at the convenience store.\n\nThe way his eyes fill with tears as he just looks at her – in the context that his last memory, from before his time travel, had been that she was gone forever – feels very heartfelt and poignant. I liked this a lot.\n\nE7-8. I also really do like the scene where Si Heon dashes out to buy a birthday cake for Jun Hee, and then belatedly gets to share it with her, after she returns to the restaurant after breaking up with her no-good cheating boyfriend.\n\nAfter being treated so poorly by her no-good cheating boyfriend (who’s now her ex-boyfriend) on her birthday, it’s little wonder that Jun Hee would feel so touched to see “Yeon Jun” have that cake lit up in her absence, while he calls her to wish her “happy birthday.”\n\nI’m glad that she doesn’t walk away, and instead, goes up to him and tells him to wish her “happy birthday” face-to-face.\n\nThis definitely feels like a pivotal moment in their connection, as she tells him to make a wish too, and then when he smiles and tells her that his wish has already come true because she’s there with him, she smiles in return.\n\nAw. That is a very nice moment indeed. 🥰\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nKang Hoon as In Gyu\n\nI just wanted to say that I thought Kang Hoon was perfectly cast as In Gyu.\n\nEven though I started this review by saying that it would be helpful to not expect our characters to be similar to their SOOD counterparts, it was actually a real bonus for me personally, that Kang Hoon as In Gyu, has such a similar vibe, as Patrick Shih as Junjie.\n\nTo my eyes, he fit the role perfectly, and brought In Gyu to life in a manner that felt pitch perfect for the character’s gentle spirit and tender heart.\n\n#### STUFF THAT WAS OK\n\nThe way Show is streamlined\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, I do think that this remake does a good job of streamlining information, so that it’s easier to receive and digest.\n\nI feel that Show does this in two ways.\n\n1. Show is structurally more streamlined\n\nWhat I mean is, Show’s cut out some stuff from the original, and then connected the dots in a more obvious fashion, so that we as an audience, would find it easier to see how the various pieces connect together.\n\nI do think that this is a good thing, because as much as I loved Someday Or One Day, there were some elements that I didn’t care for so much, like the cartoony office antics.\n\n2. Show digests information for us\n\nWhat I mean is, Show has a tendency to digest information for us, instead of giving us the information to us, to do with it what we will.\n\nTypically, Show does this by getting our characters to digest the information for us, and informing us, via their lines, what conclusions we can draw, from the new piece of information.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE3-4. For example, when Jun Hee realizes that the math doesn’t add up, and that Si Heon can’t be Yeon Jun, she goes through an entire internal monologue, working through all the pieces of information, to come to her conclusion, which we, as an audience, are privy to.\n\nSee what I mean about her digesting the information for us, instead of allowing us to digest it for ourselves, and reach our own conclusions?\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nThis could be seen as a pro or a con, depending on where you’re coming from.\n\nI personally loved that the original dropped information in a somewhat scattered fashion, because that upped the challenge in terms of piecing everything together.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge that this could be too much of a challenge for some, who don’t enjoy this kind of thing.\n\nThis show’s more streamlined and straightforward treatment of those bits of information would be welcome by this group of viewers, I think.\n\nI do think that this is part of Show’s effort to keep audiences, ie, because it’s easier to stay on track with the information that Show is serving up, Show believes that more viewers are likely to stick with Show, instead of dropping out because they can’t follow what’s going on.\n\nAnd I do feel that quite a lot of viewers would appreciate, particularly the casual viewers who don’t prefer to pay full attention while watching their dramas. Or even viewers who struggle to focus for extended periods of time, because of health issues.\n\nI can see how this storytelling approach would be helpful for a lot of people.\n\nAt the same time, I do (quietly) mourn the loss of the experience that Someday Or One Day gave us, which was the opportunity to discover what the various pieces of information meant, for ourselves, and piece it all together, for ourselves.\n\nThere was a distinct thrill that came with that experience, which is, while not completely absent from this show, is very much muted, in comparison.\n\nPlease note that I’m just offering up this comparison as a matter of interest, and don’t intend to diss this show in favor of SOOD; I just felt that it was interesting to note the difference in storytelling technique, and also, think about who might be benefiting from this different style of telling our story.\n\nChanges to the story that worked out to neutral for me\n\nI realize that I only have one thing in this category, and that is Show’s treatment of Yeon Jun’s story, which I found to be very different from SOOD.\n\nI found it an interesting / refreshing choice, because it’s a pretty big change, which changes Show’s thematic focus, to some degree.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\n[SOOD SPOILER]\n\nIn SOOD, Quansheng had been harshly rejected, not just by the boy he liked, but by his fellow students as well, which had then led him to consider suicide.\n\nIn fact, I had considered this to be a pretty key point, since the production team behind SOOD had expressed that they’d been inspired by the issue of bullying / outcasts, in making the show.\n\n[END SOOD SPOILER]\n\nHere, however, Yeon Jun’s feelings are very much reciprocated, and we even have a little burgeoning love story, and therefore none of the rejection, bullying and outcast dynamic that we’d gotten in SOOD.\n\nI thought this was a pretty interesting and bold choice, because this means that Show is making a conscious choice to deviate thematically, from the original, which is something that I hadn’t expected.\n\nSome people would hate this thematic deviation, while others would likely find it fine, I’m sure.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nAhn Hyo Seop as Si Heon / Yeon Jun\n\nHonestly, when this k-remake was first announced, I was pretty upset with the casting of Ahn Hyo Seop, because I was convinced that he didn’t have the acting range required for the role of the male lead.\n\nAnd thennn. I watched Dr. Romantic 3 (review here!), where Ahn Hyo Seop had some very difficult scenes, and he did really well in them, and I decided that he must have more range than I’d given him credit for, and my feelings about him being cast, promptly neutralized. 😁\n\nOverall, I’d say that Ahn Hyo Seop does a reasonable job of the role, in the sense that there were some moments where I thought he did well, and then there were some scenes where I wasn’t feeling his delivery, so much.\n\n..Which is why his performance evens out as fairly neutral, to me.\n\nI will say for the record, that I thought he did a decent job in the delivery of Yeon Jun, when Show delves into Yeon Jun’s story via flashback in episodes 7 &amp; 8.\n\nWhile I was confused at first, thinking that it was Si Heon on my screen, it didn’t take very long for me to pick up on the body language cues that informed me that this was, in fact, Yeon Jun that I was watching.\n\nJeon Yeo Been as Jun Hee / Min Ju\n\nI’m honestly a little afraid to say this, but – please don’t hate me – I found Jeon Yeo Been’s performance rather uneven, in this show. 🙈😬\n\nI know that this is personal to every viewer, because I’ve come across multiple comments raving about her performance in this; that she’s basically eating up every scene.\n\nAnd I’m in my own corner, wondering why I don’t feel the same way? 🙈\n\nPlease know that I have enjoyed Jeon Yeo Been a lot in other shows (like Be Melodramatic and Vincenzo), and have nothing against her, as an actress.\n\nI honestly think she’s great, generally speaking, and I was particularly taken with her melancholic character in Be Melodramatic.\n\nI’m just not sure why her delivery in this show lands as such a mixed bag for me. Maybe it has to do with how she was directed..?\n\nI just want to reiterate that I didn’t hate her performance; I just felt.. disconnected from her performance. I think that’s the best way to put it. 😅\n\nSometimes I just don’t feel it\n\nI don’t know how to explain it, but there are times when she’s going through all the appropriate motions on my screen, but somehow, I find myself failing to truly connect with the sadness (for example) that she’s communicating, through her tears.\n\nThe various characters\n\nOverall, I feel that Jeon Yeo Been looks most at home playing Jun Hee while she’s in 1998, in Min Ju’s body.\n\nThat’s when I feel like she’s believably inhabiting the character, and this is when I feel like her delivery feels most natural, comparatively speaking.\n\nI feel like the performance I feel most disconnected from, is when Jeon Yeo Been is playing Min Ju, mostly.\n\nI get that Min Ju is a character who feels uncomfortable in her own skin, but I’m not actually pinpointing whether Jeon Yeo Been feels comfortable in Min Ju’s skin.\n\nRather, I feel like the way Jeon Yeo Been’s delivering Min Ju feels kind of.. fake and unnatural?\n\nAs in, it feels like she’s purposely walking a certain way, and talking a certain way, but I find neither thing believable. It feels more like she’s play-acting as Min Ju, rather than being Min Ju, if you know what I mean? 🙊\n\nOf course, like I said earlier, this is completely, absolutely subjective, and you might possibly love Jeon Yeo Been’s performance in this, like so many other folks do.\n\nOne specific thing\n\nThis is Min Ju\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI will say that there is one specific thing about Jeon Yeo Been’s delivery that contributes quite a bit, to throwing me off.\n\nBasically, it’s the way she walks as Jun Hee while in Min Ju’s body.\n\nMin Ju the character has a way of walking which is very peculiar; she walks with her feet turned in, and her arms straight by her sides, with her hands often curled into fists.\n\nIt looks highly unnatural, and I don’t particularly care for it, but I can buy the idea that this is how Min Ju walks, and that it goes with her “social outcast” sort of vibe.\n\nThe thing is, I noticed that Jun Hee occasionally kinda walks like that, while in Min Ju’s body.\n\nThis is Jun Hee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNot always, but sometimes, those ticks – like the straight arms with clenched fists, and the inward-turning feet – are there, and I can’t help wondering if Jeon Yeo Been kind of maybe forgot which character she was in, and just walked like that, just because she was in school uniform? 😅\n\nBecause, importantly, Jun Hee in 2023 doesn’t walk like that, so there’s no reason she would walk like that, in 1998, just because she’s in Min Ju’s body.\n\nAfter all, she’s never actually met Min Ju, so she wouldn’t know Min Ju walks like that, and so I can’t rationalize that she’s just trying to stay in character while living as Min Ju.\n\nI’m sorry that I don’t have more screenshots of this to illustrate what I mean. I definitely picked up on it more than once, during my watch. It’s not always there, but sometimes it shows up.\n\nAnyway. This is a key thing that distracted me about Jeon Yeo Been’s delivery as Jun Hee, but it’s not a dealbreaker. I was just rather distracted whenever it came up, is all.\n\nThe chemistry between Ahn Hyo Seop and Jeon Yeo Been\n\nThe chemistry between Ahn Hyo Seop and Jeon Yeo Been, as Si Heon and Jun Hee, was rather uneven for me too.\n\nI felt that their chemistry worked best when Si Heon and Jun Hee are in high school together, while Jun Hee’s in Min Ju’s body.\n\nThat chemistry was friendly and easy, and I thought that worked pretty well.\n\nHowever, when it comes to times in our story when we get distinctly romantic moments between Si Heon and Jun Hee, I felt that the chemistry that between them came across as more posey than natural, and that took away from the “real, true love” that I wanted to see between our OTP.\n\nEven the kisses that we get between them feel very posed for the camera, when I feel like having them interact in a more natural way would give us a more dynamic, alive sort of feel, for their relationship.\n\nOverall, I felt the OTP connection worked out to just ok, for me.\n\nMin Jin Woong as Chan Yeong / Chan Hui [SPOILERS]\n\nAt first, I appreciated Min Jin Woong’s portrayal of both Chan Yeong and Chan Hui in episodes 9 &amp; 10.\n\nAt that point, I’d felt that the dual roles allowed him to show his acting range quite nicely, even though I did also think that Chan Yeong being all murderous was kind of on the hammy side. 😅\n\nAs I got into Show’s finale stretch, however, we didn’t see Chan Hui much if at all, and Chan Yeong just got more hammy and glowery, which led me to change my mind about this role being a nice showcase of his range, oops. 🙊\n\nThe way Show kdramafies itself\n\nOne of the key things that I came to accept, is that Show, in classic kdrama fashion, leans harder into the romance than its source material.\n\nGiven that leaning into the romance is something that is so quintessentially kdrama-esque, I don’t begrudge that of Show; it’s part of Show’s way of making this story its own, after all.\n\nIn fact, I actually found it quite fascinating to observe what quirks jumped out at me, as being quintessentially kdrama; that this was Show’s way of kdramafying itself.\n\nFor the record, I do think that these types of details stood out to me more, because I’ve seen how this story’s been done without these kdrama touches.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE3-4. I’d like to talk about that closing scene in episode 4, where Si Heon takes Jun Hee to that park, to sit under that tree, because he wants to talk about redefining their relationship, out of deference to In Gyu’s feelings for Jun Hee.\n\nThe scene actually is very, very similar to its counterpart in SOOD, with our leads taking turns to fall asleep while the other person is talking, each of them contemplating the other in a thoughtful, vulnerable way.\n\nThe difference here, is that in this show, we have our leads actually reaching out to touch the other person, which didn’t happen in SOOD.\n\nAnd I picked up on this right away, recognizing this “reaching out to the other person” thing, whether actually making contact or not, as being quintessentially kdrama.\n\nE5-6. During the drawing competition arc, there’s that moment when Jun Hee picks the grass off Si Heon’s hair, and they share A Moment, as their gazes lock.\n\nTee hee hee. This is so very kdrama, but I kinda love it?\n\nOf course, that moment in the rain, along that beautiful green stretch alongside the trees, is also quite kdrama.\n\nWhat I mean is, yes, there was an iconic rain scene in SOOD too, but trust the kdrama version to make sure the scene happens on a picturesque path where they’re framed by trees.\n\nIt kinda gives me classic Winter Sonata vibes, heh.\n\nE9-10. I thought about why Show would have Si Heon die in the apartment, rather than out in the street, like how Ziwei had died, in SOOD, and here’s what I realized.\n\nIt was largely because Show wanted a dying Si Heon to be able to futilely reach for Jun Hee with his dying breath, in classic kdrama fashion.\n\nAnd, also, in classic kdrama fashion, have a single tear fall from his eye, even as he breathes his last.\n\nI mean, that’s sooo kdrama, isn’t it? 😁\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\n#### STUFF I DIDN’T LIKE SO MUCH\n\nExecution that created loss of impact of some scenes\n\nSo.. this is the section where I talk about the changes that Show made, that I didn’t like so much.\n\nI hope it’s clear by now, that I am not against the idea of Show making changes, in order to create its own uniquely flavored take on its source material.\n\nIt’s just that there were certain changes that Show made, that I felt took away from the impact of certain scenes, or diluted the emotional resonance of certain parts of our story.\n\nHere’s the quick rundown of the key things that I felt didn’t work so well, when it came to Show’s tweaks.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1. As a matter of interest, although the scene at the end of episode 1 is very similar to the end of the end of SOOD’s first episode, I have to admit that the way this show does it, isn’t as impactful as how it was done in SOOD.\n\nThe reason for this, is that in this show, Jun Hee comes upon the photo of the three friends, quite a long time before the final scene, and so, by then, we already know that Jun Hee isn’t the person in the photo.\n\nWhereas, in SOOD, our female lead Yuxuan sees the photo right before the closing of episode 1, where Ziwei asks Yunru for her name, in the record shop.\n\nThat creates a mind-blown sort of moment for the viewer, because, in that short moment, we finally realize that the girl we’ve been watching in high school, isn’t the same person as the woman we’ve been watching in our current day timeline.\n\nI do wish that Show would have retained that element of surprise, because that would have been really fun for new viewers of this story.\n\nE1-2. Credit to Anisa from Dramas Over Flowers for pointing this out in their podcast episode where the ladies talk about this show.\n\nAnisa pointed out that we never see Min Ju using a walkman or wearing earbuds through the entire stretch up till the accident, which creates a disconnect from the plot point where Si Heon and In Gyu give her a new Walkman for her birthday, because her old one is worn out.\n\nE3-4. Because of In Gyu’s reprimand, that Si Heon seeks out Jun Hee to apologize, and that’s how they end up having their first in-depth conversation, where she tells him about her “dream” where he’d been Yeon Jun, and they’d been in a long-term relationship together.\n\nAt this point, we know that this isn’t a dream, but I do buy the idea that Jun Hee is confused about what is real and what is not, and actually starts to believe that she really is Min Ju, and that her entire life as Jun Hee had been a long and complicated dream that she’d dreamt, while in her coma.\n\nThis creates an interesting effect, I’d say, because in SOOD, I’d believed this too, along with our female lead, whereas here, we as an audience are already sure that Jun Hee and Min Ju are two different people, but Jun Hee herself isn’t so sure, at this point.\n\nE7-8. I feel like Show uses a too-light sort of touch, when it comes to Si Heon actually starting to believe for real, that Min Ju really is Jun Hee, a completely different person who’s from 2023.\n\nI feel like we don’t get to see enough of Si Heon interacting with Jun Hee, while believing that she’s Jun Hee, even though he does state, for the record, that he believes her, and wants to know more about the person he likes.\n\nI realize that this is quite crucial, in terms of providing believable context to the part in our story where Si Heon lands in Yeon Jun’s body and starts to work his way towards meeting Jun Hee in university.\n\nWithout being able to witness for myself, for some length of meaningful time, Si Heon interacting with Jun Hee, and having feelings for her, while believing her time travel story, I find that it’s that much harder to buy into the subsequent development, where he lands in Yeon Jun’s body and works to find his way back to her.\n\nInstead, it’s really not that much screen time later, that we see Si Heon landing in Yeon Jun’s body, via the accident.\n\nThis felt rather rushed to my eyes, and even though I can’t remember the exact sequence of events in SOOD, I do recall being able to fully buy into our male lead striving to connect again with our female lead.\n\nEssentially, I felt able to believe in his love for her, and I think that’s the missing link for me, this set of episodes: I feel like Si Heon’s feelings for Jun Hee aren’t overtly present enough, for me to buy into the rash confession that he makes to her, when he tells her that he’s liked her for a long time, and doesn’t want to waste any more time.\n\nE7-8. This entire stretch of Si Heon trying to make a connection with Jun Hee while in Yeon Jun’s body is kinda underwhelming for me, personally.\n\nI don’t hate it, but I do wish that Show could have given me something more.. potent?\n\nAs it is, I feel like Si Heon’s going through all the motions, but I’m not feeling a potency of emotion from him, when it comes to how he feels about Jun Hee.\n\nAnd, without that potency of emotion coming through, it’s hard to buy into why he would dedicate himself so much, to reconnecting with her, and courting her, such that she would fall for “Yeon Jun” just like he’d remembered her describing, back in 1998.\n\nSo far, I feel like what I’m getting is a more diluted version of what I’d hoped for, and I feel rather disappointed about that.\n\nAlso, can I also just say that Si Heon blurting out that thing about him liking Jun Hee, and how his feelings have nothing to do with how long they’ve known each other, is very out of character for him.\n\nI’ve accepted that Si Heon is not brash, impetuous or outspoken like his Taiwanese counterpart Ziwei, so to have him say this, pretty much out of the blue, felt really out of character, and therefore rather perplexing, to me.\n\nIn fact, generally speaking, I found the more comedic moments, like during the blind date, when Si Heon is all flustered around Jun Hee, a tiny bit jarring, because I don’t have that mental association with his character in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, Si Heon’s the casually, effortlessly cool one, among the various characters, and it’s just.. a little odd to see him suddenly be all flustered and at a loss.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to reiterate that this was not a key issue in my feeling underwhelmed by the romancing arc, we get in episode 8.\n\nIt’s just an issue that compounded my bemusement that stemmed from the relative lack of supporting context around Si Heon’s feelings for Jun Hee.\n\nI will say that this did become better, for me, once Si Heon decides to dial things back and take a more restrained approach.\n\nThis, to my eyes, felt a lot more like the Si Heon that I’d come to know from 1998, and that landed a lot more comfortably, for me.\n\nE9-10. One of my main points of dissatisfaction at this point in our story, is that I feel Show isn’t giving us enough of the love story between Si Heon and Jun Hee to ground this whole thing.\n\nI need to feel like their love is more epic, in order to buy into everything else that Show is serving up.\n\nI need to believe that they love each other enough, to want to move heaven and earth for the sake of their love, and.. I’m just not feeling it?\n\nThe minting of their relationship in college feels kind of rushed, to my eyes.\n\nFirst, it felt to me as if Jun Hee came around rather quickly, and then it also felt to me, like we didn’t get enough time to dwell on their wholesome happiness as a couple, before it all started to come apart, with Jun Hee insisting on leaving Korea without him, and the plane crash happening very quickly after that.\n\nI’m rather perplexed by this narrative decision, because aren’t kdramas typically really good at serving up the romance?\n\nIn fact, I’ve been saying that this show is kdrama-fying SOOD, and one of the big ways it’s doing that, is by leaning into the romance.\n\nSo why, when it’s finally time for the romance actually bloom, is Show glossing over things so quickly, that I feel like we don’t really get a chance to feel the feels? (Which, in my opinion, are essential, for this story to reach epic heights.)\n\nI do think part of the problem is the fact that this remake is shorter than the original, but also, like I mentioned earlier, there’s just something missing in the OTP chemistry, as well as the teasing out of their love story.\n\nE9-10. I feel the scene where Jun Hee grieves Si Heon’s death is not as impactful as in SOOD, and the reason for this, is, I find it distracting that Show has Jun Hee process information for us – that Chan Yeong wouldn’t have been able to go to 1998 to do all those horrific things, if she hadn’t told him about it all – when I’d expected her to be grieving.\n\nI was so convinced that this wasn’t the approach in SOOD, that I went back to check how SOOD had treated this moment, and I found that there was no such similar thing, with Yuxuan.\n\nInstead, we just sat with Yuxuan in her grief, because, for a while, she’s just too overcome with grief to even speak – and I felt that that landed as more authentic, to me.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nActor delivery – sometimes\n\nI honestly wasn’t sure whether to share this section, because I don’t want you guys to think I’m a hater, but I decided to share it anyway, in the spirit of being fair.\n\nLike, since I talked about finding Jeon Yeo Been’s performance being a mixed bag for me, where I sometimes just wasn’t feeling it, here’s a section where I talk about other actors’ performances leaving me cold too, heh.\n\nHonestly, guys. I really do like these actors, and I really did try to get into the flow, but I gotta be honest: I just wasn’t feeling it, sometimes. 🙊\n\nI don’t know why, honestly. I was watching several other shows at the same time, like I always do, and I was able to engage emotionally with other dramas, so it’s not like my feelings weren’t working or something. 😅\n\nAgain, perhaps it had something to do with how they were being directed?\n\nThis is entirely subjective, of course, and I’m sure that there are lots of folks who are perfectly satisfied with the amount of emotional heft that our actors serve up.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE9-10. I find that I’m not fully buying the emotion that our characters are serving up.\n\nAs in, they are doing the right things, and crying tears, and looking pained or perplexed as the situation calls for it, but.. to my eyes, it feels like I’m seeing a slightly hollow version of the feelings that I’m expecting?\n\nIt sounds presumptuous of me to say this, but to my eyes, at least, it feels like our actors are going through the paces, but not actually immersed in their roles enough to actually feel at one with their characters?\n\nI mean, sure, they could be actually immersed in their roles and I could be reading it all wrong, but this is just what it looks like to my eyes, and I wish that I was receiving it differently. 🙈\n\nLike when In Gyu realized that his grandmother is ill, and confronts Si Heon at the hospital, for example.\n\nIt’s all quite dramatic, with In Gyu grabbing Si Heon’s collar and crying as he blames Si Heon for not telling him that Gran was ill, but.. I’m not really feeling it, to be brutally honest. 🙊😬\n\nAnd then, there’s the scene where Si Heon rushes to try to prevent In Gyu’s suicide.\n\nI just feel like I wanted more complex emotions from them both, honestly.\n\nTo be brutally honest (please don’t hate me), I’m slightly underwhelmed by Ahn Hyo Seop’s portrayal of Si Heon’s desperate urgency and his horror and grief, and I’m also perplexed at why In Gyu is portrayed as being so flatly expressionless, before he falls to his death.\n\nSimilarly, I felt like the scene where Jun Hee reunites with Si Heon in the present should have been more emotionally nuanced and raw, but again, I wasn’t feeling what I’d expected to feel, at this very significant point in our story.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nSome of the comic touches\n\nThis isn’t a huge deal by any means, but I just thought that I’d state for the record, that there were times when Show’s comic touches didn’t really land so well, for me.\n\nGenerally, this was when the spots of levity felt awkwardly injected and out of place.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE3-4. Like this moment when Jun Hee throws her hands up and twirls around, blustering about why she’s back in 1998.\n\nThat doesn’t feel organic to Jun Hee’s character, to my eyes, and felt like an odd stab at serving up something funny, which just didn’t quite work, in my opinion.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\n#### THOUGHTS ON THE ENDING [SPOILERS]\n\nComing into this finale, I’d been curious about whether Show would stay aligned to the source material, or choose to make this ending its own, and in the end, I’d say it’s kinda both?\n\nIn that, this stays true to the original, mostly, with a few touches to make this ending its own.\n\nAnd, I’ll say that I am reasonably satisfied, with the ending.\n\nWe get all the various twists and turns that lead to Min Ju eventually managing to survive the murder, and then have Jun Hee managing to return to 1995 once more, and this time, she is determined to set things in their proper place, by destroying the tape and the player.\n\nI will say that in the original, it had been clearer to me, that the reason that Yuxuan chose to destroy the tape, was not just to save Yunru, but to also save Ziwei and Junjie; that she chose to love them by protecting them, even if it meant that they wouldn’t be able to remember one another.\n\nIn this version, I felt that the focus was more on setting things back in place for Min Ju, with less focus on saving Si Heon and In Gyu.\n\nI mean, yes, of course with the destruction of the tape and everything being reset, this results in Si Heon and In Gyu being saved too, so it’s not like Jun Hee only set out to save Min Ju.\n\nI just found the focus much stronger on Min Ju, and I found that to be an.. interesting choice.\n\nPerhaps writer-nim felt that so much had been taken from Min Ju, with Jun Hee taking over her life, that it was only right that our finale focused more on Min Ju, and setting things right for her? I’m not sure.\n\nI also would have preferred if Min Ju’s renewed hope in life had more to do with coming to love herself more, like in the original, rather than about seeing In Gyu’s feelings for her in a more positive light.\n\nI would also have preferred more acknowledgment from Show, that Jun Hee was doing this just as much because she cared so deeply about Si Heon and In Gyu, that she couldn’t allow them to die again and again, in this cycle of fate that they’d found themselves in.\n\nI found the final moments on the beach suitably poignant and touching, and the subsequent erasing of their shared experiences and memories, bittersweet.\n\nAt the same time, I have to admit that this show didn’t manage to give me chills with the beach scene, the same way SOOD did.\n\nAnd you might think that that’s because I’d watched SOOD first, and well, you wouldn’t be wrong about that.\n\nIt’s just that I did go back to revisit the beach scene in SOOD after finishing this show, just to refresh my memory, to see if Show had done anything significantly different than SOOD that I’d missed.\n\nAnd, I was so surprised to find that I got literal chills watching the beach scene, and found it so much more affecting, than the scene I’d just watched, minutes ago, in A Time Called You.\n\nThis, even though the main beats of both scenes are very similar.\n\nIn that sense, I do think that there’s something about SOOD that was just lightning in a bottle for me, such that it still brings back very strong feels, even like this, when I go back to a specific scene, and dive in, without watching the lead-up.\n\nFor the record, though, I do appreciate what Show was trying to do there, pointing us to the Big Possibility of a happy ending, with Si Heon and Jun Hee meeting again, 2011.\n\nWe don’t get the same solid crumb of possibility in SOOD, which I felt had left me with a beautiful, haunting sense of equal parts loss and hope, and that had worked really well for me.\n\nIn my head, I’d always clung to the idea that Ziwei and Yuxuan would find their way to each other all over again, even though everything had been reset, and that open ending, full of hope and uncertainty, has really stayed with me.\n\nI’m sure though, that there are viewers who had wished for something a little more concrete, and this finale offers exactly that.\n\nWe get to see Si Heon being drawn to Jun Hee and taking steps to connect with her, and if kdrama tradition is anything to go by (which of course it is), this almost certainly points to the beginning of a brand new chapter of their love story. 🥲\n\n#### THE FINAL VERDICT:\n\nA likely reasonably solid watch for those who are new to this story, but probably underwhelming for those who loved SOOD first.\n\n#### FINAL GRADE: B\n\n#### TRAILER:\n\n#### MV:\n\n### PATREON UPDATE!\n\nThe next drama I’ll be covering on Patreon, in place of A Time Called You, is The Story Of Park’s Marriage Contract [Korea].

And I did not watch the trailers for A Time Called You. And I love that I did neither. This show blew me away. There were so many times I cried and so many times I fell in love. I actually have just started watching K-dramas due to Netflix. My first K-drama starred Ahn and I enjoyed that so much, I had to see what else he was in. That’s how I came across this jewel that quickly spun me into its magical web of mystery and love that defies space and time.\n\nYou made a point regarding the end, how it felt more about saving Min-Ju than anyone else. I felt like saving her love’s life is her priority, but she was just vague because making things right and saving Min-Ju would save them all without drowning in the details of his death. She couldn’t even bring herself to destroy the cassette player. Destroying it would mean losing her love forever and she had to trust In-Gyu to do it for her. If it was just to save Min-Ju, I believe she would have had an easier time with the task. NGL I was scared for her, trusting someone else with something so important though.\n\nI think Ahn-Hyo Seop did a phenomenal job as the lead actor. I could drown in his eyes, they conveyed so much emotion. His love for her was the kind love songs are written about.\n\nSometimes I wanted more from Han Jun-Hee but that was just my inner fan gurl crying out for this beautiful creature who loved her so. In reality, she did superb. I knew she loved him deeply even if she wasn’t over the top. It’s not for women to sing their love. Women are meant to be sung to, they are the muses that inspire men to feel weak in the knees but still retain the strength to carry them. I know her heart sang just for him even if it appeared like he did all the heavy lifting for their love at times.\n\nI think they did a great job of weaving the story and providing answers, I did not feel lost. All in all, I would happily watch this again. I won’t be sitting on edge biting my nails from anxiety this time. Now that I know the ending, now that I know he finds her, I fully believe he will find his home within her heart again. The second time around will be to enjoy the beautiful moments again and to catch anything I may have missed the first time around knowing what I know now.\n\nThank you for a lovely review, I enjoyed reading. I felt like this was lighting in a bottle for me, so I may have to catch the original and see what magic may be unearthed there!\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 months ago\n\nReply to\n\nHi there Dee, thanks for enjoying the review ❤️, and putting up with my heart-eyes for SOOD, when you haven’t actually seen the show! 😅 Since you’re toying with the idea of checking out SOOD, I just wanted to say that I very much support the idea! Perhaps having seen this first, might even work in your favor, since that would make the twists and turns in SOOD much easier for you to follow!\n\nPS: Congratulations on starting your kdrama journey!! The great thing about being a little late to the party, is that there are soooo many great shows that you can check out, aside from the currently airing ones! You might find my Full List useful (here!). It’s not a comprehensive list of all the shows out there, but it is a list of all the shows I’ve written about, on this site. I hope you’ll enjoy poking around! ❤️\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncc\n\n8 months ago\n\nI have just watched this Show (I totally missed the boat on this one) and most of the reviews who saw SOOD first did not want to even give this remake a chance. and if you love a piece of work so much, it will be hard to accept anything else as worthy. I appreciate your review in which you totally say how much you love the original, but you do seem to give a more balanced and neutral review of how this Korean remake works and maybe does not work for you. Instead of simply stating how inferior it is to the original. That type of review does not help new viewers to a remake decide if this show is worthwhile to watch or not. Again, appreciate your balanced and detailed take on this remake (which I really feel quite attached to).\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8 months ago\n\nReply to\n\nAw, I’m glad that you found this review fair, cc.. I understand that it can be painful to read a beloved show being torn apart by someone else. I did my best to give as balanced a view as possible, and I’m glad that that worked well for you! Thanks for reading, and for your kind note! ❤️\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenapeters\n\n1 year ago\n\nI really enjoyed reading this review comparing A Time Called You and SOOD. I know you said you would have liked to have been able to review A Time Called You on its own for the new-to-the-story readers, but for those of us who have seen and loved SOOD, your breakdown of what you liked and disliked about the remake in comparison to the original was perfect.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nAw thank you, @enapeters, I’m so glad that you enjoyed the side-by-side comparison! ❤️ I will say that it was a very interesting experience for me, to see how the versions differ, even though this show didn’t manage to capture my heart the way SOOD did. It was worth it, for science! 😁\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABV\n\n1 year ago\n\nThank you very much for the great review as always. I have not watched the original so I have really been mulling over whether to pick this one or not. What makes me hesitate is actually the casting of the leads in this drama as I was apprehensive over whether they are suitable for their respective roles. Thankfully, I do not have to compare this series to its original. It is pretty much universally accepted that the original is the superior series. But one of the main reasons to watch this is the accessibility anyway.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nThis is definitely much more accessible than the original.. but I would also say, if you hesitate because of the casting of the leads in this one, you’re not wrong.. I did feel like there was something lacking in the leads’ delivery, and this could be due to the way they were directed, &amp;/or their own interpretation of the roles.\n\nIf you are neutral about wanting to check out this show, perhaps try the original? If you are able to get into it, SOOD really is very, very special. 🥹❤️\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABV\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nThank you for the clarification. My apprehension was born from the fact that I have watched the leads in the shows that you mentioned in your review and from the few clips I have seen of this series, something felt off.\n\nUsually, if there is a spark, you feel it right away and that can be the trigger to pick up a series.\n\nGiven how acclaimed Someday Or One Day is, I guess I should give it a shot. I have not watched a Taiwanese Drama before so this would be my first. If I watch it though, then watching the Korean version would be more difficult. Quite the dilemma.🤔\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nHmm.. I’d say, give the original a try, since you do have curiosity about it, and if you can’t get into it (maybe because you’re not feeling the Taiwanese style, for eg), then give this one a try? The original looks less polished, but that is part of its charm, and the actors spark together so well. ❤️\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABV\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nThank you. I will probably end up doing this. I am definitely curious about the series itself and I want to experience it as so many people seem to like it.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nI do have episode notes available for SOOD, if that helps!

It doesn’t quite capture all of the magic of SOOD, but it does make everything easier to process and digest, comparatively speaking, and it does so while being very pretty to look at, since Show’s production values are extremely polished, and its cast, very good-looking.\n    </ShortVerdict>\n\n    <LongVerdict>\n        If you had trouble getting into SOOD, perhaps because you find it hard to dial into the vibe of Taiwanese dramas, or perhaps because you find it hard to watch dramas that aren’t Korean, then this is a drama that would likely work well for you. Also, if you found it difficult to keep up with all the twists, turns and developments in SOOD, this show could also work well for you.\n    </LongVerdict>\n\n    <OSTAlbum>\n        Here’s the OST album, in case you’d like to listen to it while you read the review. Overall, I’d say that the music in this show is pleasant and inoffensive. While I didn’t dislike any of the music tracks that I heard during my watch, I have to confess that none of the songs actually got under my skin, unfortunately.\n    </OSTAlbum>\n\n    <ReviewApproach>\n        I thought and thought about this, you guys, and I realize that this review will just have to be different from how my reviews are typically organized, and here’s the reason why. Coming into this show, I tried to be as fair and as objective as I possibly could, as I watched this remake. Seriously, I even tried to practice drama amnesia, and forget that I knew anything about this story world, going in.\n    </ReviewApproach>\n\n    <NecessityOfRemake>\n        This is a question that I heard bandied about quite a lot, by fans of SOOD, pretty soon after <Name>A Time Called You</Name> aired. Ultimately, even though Show doesn’t manage to recapture the magic that was SOOD, I do think that it’s a worthwhile remake, for the simple reason that the remake makes the story more accessible.\n    </NecessityOfRemake>\n\n    <ManagingExpectations>\n        Here are a few things that I think would be helpful to keep in mind, to maximize your enjoyment of your watch. \n        1. Don’t expect Show to be a replica of SOOD.\n        2. Don’t expect the characters to be replicas of their SOOD counterparts.\n        3. Think of the plot twists as tropes.\n        4. If you haven’t seen SOOD, then go in blind.\n    </ManagingExpectations>\n\n    <StuffILiked>\n        Show is very pretty to look at. The intense Spring palette is very pretty, and when combined with actual scenery, like pink blossoms amid greenery, it really, really pops with Pretty. I have no aversion to Pretty, so this was quite welcome, in my books.\n    </StuffILiked>\n\n    <StuffThatWasOk>\n        The way Show is streamlined. Like I mentioned earlier, I do think that this remake does a good job of streamlining information, so that it’s easier to receive and digest.\n    </StuffThatWasOk>\n\n    <StuffIDidntLikeSoMuch>\n        Execution that created loss of impact of some scenes. There were certain changes that Show made, that I felt took away from the impact of certain scenes, or diluted the emotional resonance of certain parts of our story.\n    </StuffIDidntLikeSoMuch>\n\n    <FinalVerdict>\n        A likely reasonably solid watch for those who are new to this story, but probably underwhelming for those who loved SOOD first.\n    </FinalVerdict>\n    \n    <FinalGrade>B</FinalGrade>\n</Review>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes while maintaining the original meaning and flow of the article.

The film depicts the friendship and  love between young people in high school in 1999.[1] It was released on October 21, 2022, on Netflix.[2]\n\n## Plot\n\nSet in 1999, the story revolves around Na Bo-ra (Kim Yoo-jung), a seventeen-year-old high school student with a bright personality. Bo-ra's best friend, Yeon-du (Roh Yoon-seo), who has been preparing to visit the US for heart surgery, suddenly declares that she cannot leave as she has fallen in love with a boy from their school whose name she knows as Baek Hyun-jin (Park Jung-woo). Bo-ra promises that she will follow Baek Hyun-jin, find out everything about him, and email what she discovers. Reassured, Yeon-du departs.\n\nAt school, Bo-ra starts to follow Hyun-jin. One day, she overhears that Hyun-jin and his best friend Poong Woon-ho (Byeon Woo-seok) will join the broadcasting club at school, so she successfully auditions to join the club. While Woon-ho joins the club, Hyun-jin does not. Bo-ra tries to get close to Woon-ho in order to observe Hyun-jin.\n\nHyun-jin, mistaken that Bo-ra is interested in him, asks her to date him only to be rejected by her. Meanwhile, Bo-ra realizes that she has fallen in love with Woon-ho, who has developed feelings for her as well.\n\nWhen Yeon-du returns to Korea after successful heart surgery, they realize that Bo-ra has been following the wrong boy, and that the real 'Baek Hyun-jin' whom Yeon-du loves is actually Poong Woon-ho, a confusion caused by the boy wearing his friend's school jacket bearing his name tag. Loyal to her friend, and protective because of her health condition, Bo-ra conceals that she loves the same Woon-ho. Then Bo-ra starts to avoid Woon-ho so that their blossoming relationship will end, but through Hyun-jin, Yeon-du learns that Woon-ho and Bo-ra like each other. A tearful Yeon-du tells Bo-ra that she can give up Woon-ho for the sake of their friendship, that Bo-ra is the most cherished person for her. Yeon-du is disappointed that Bo-ra was not honest with her and hid her feelings for Woon-ho.\n\nMeanwhile, Woon-ho prepares to move back to New Zealand to resume life with his mother and younger brother. On the day of his departure, with the help of Yeon-du and Hyun-jin, Bo-ra arrives at the train station just in time for them to confess their feelings before separating. They maintain contact while Woon-ho plans to attend university in Seoul. Without explanation, Woon-ho stops answering Bo-ra's emails; she never hears from him again. Heartbroken, confused, and angry, Bo-ra tries to get over him.\n\nTime passes as Bo-ra attends university and matures. In 2019, she receives an invitation to an art exhibition from a person named Joseph, who turns out to be Woon-ho's younger brother, from whom she learns that Woon-ho died in an accident all those years ago. Joseph thanks Bo-ra for remembering Woon-ho and says that the happiest moments in Woon-ho's short life were spent in her company. As the film ends, Bo-ra views a heartwarming, yet heartbreaking, video made by Woon-ho that depicts their time together.\n\n## Cast\n\n### Main\n\n- Kim Yoo-jung as Na Bo-ra[ 3]\n    - Han Hyo-joo as adult Na Bo-ra[4][5]\n\n- Byeon Woo-seok as Poong Woon-ho[6]\n\n- Park Jung-woo as Baek Hyun-jin[7]\n\n- Roh Yoon-seo as Kim Yeon-du[3]\n\n### Supporting\n\n- Kim Sung-kyung as Bo-ra's mother[8]\n- Jeong Seok-yong as Bo-ra's father\n- Lee Cheon-moo as Na Ba-da, Bo-ra's younger brother\n- Yoon Yi-re as 'Madam', Bo-ra's classmate[9]\n- Jeon Hye-won as 'Darn it', Bo-ra's classmate[10]\n\n### Special appearance\n\n- Lee Beom-soo[11] as a school teacher\n- Park Hae-joon[11] as a doctor at the school infirmary\n- Ryu Seung-ryong[11] as Poong Woon-ho's father (voice)\n- Gong Myung[12] as Jung Woon-ho, Bo-ra's blind date\n- Ong Seong-wu [ 13] as Poong Jun-ho / Joseph, Poong Woon-ho's younger brother\n    - Jung Min-joon as young Jun-ho\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector Bang Woo-ri wrote the script based on her personal experience of exchanging diaries with her friend.

She stated, \"this work has a charm that makes you smile as if it were a memory of your own first love,\" and [the film] \"will be imprinted on the audience as \"Korea's representative first love movie.\"[27]\n\n## Accolades\n\n| Award ceremony       |   Year  | Category              | Nominee / Work    | Result    | Ref.    |\n|----------------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Baeksang Arts Awards |   2023  | Best New Actor – Film | Byeon Woo-seok    | Nominated | [28]    |\n| Buil Film Awards     |   2023  | Best New Actor        | Byeon Woo-seok    | Nominated | [29]    |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Kim Ye-eun (September 1, 2021). 김유정·변우석·박정우·노윤서, 넷플릭스 영화 '20세기 소녀' 출연 [공식입장] [Kim Yoo-jung, Byun Woo-seok, Park Jung-woo, and Noh Yun-seo to appear in the Netflix movie '20th Century Girl' [Official Position]] (in Korean).
