    "profile": "**Personality Traits:**  \n1. **Introspective**  \n2. **Rebellious**  \n3. **Cynical**  \n4. **Appreciative of Dark Humor**  \n5. **Critical Thinker**  \n\n**Detailed Explanation:**  \n\n1. **Introspective:**  \n   The user’s enjoyment of films like \"Fight Club\" and \"Falling Down\" suggests a tendency towards introspection.

This suggests that the user may resonate with themes of rebellion against authority or societal constraints, reflecting a desire for autonomy and a non-conformist attitude.\n\n3. **Cynical:**  \n   The user’s preference for films that often portray a bleak or critical view of society, such as \"Office Space\" and \"God Bless America,\" points to a potentially cynical outlook. These films highlight the absurdities of modern life and the frustrations of the everyday worker, suggesting that the user may have a skeptical view of societal structures and may often question the motives behind social conventions.\n\n4. **Appreciative of Dark Humor:**  \n   The choice of films like \"Office Space\" and \"God Bless America\" indicates an appreciation for dark humor and satire.

    "ADT": "Class Name: MovieRecommendation  \nAttributes:  \nName, required  \nGenre, optional  \nThemes, optional  \nTone, optional  \nProtagonist Type, optional  \nCynicism Level, optional  \nDark Humor Elements, optional  \nAdditional Information, required  \n\n### Rationale for Attributes:\n\n1. **Name (required):**  \n   This attribute is essential as it identifies the movie being recommended. It serves as the primary reference point for the user.\n\n2. **Genre (optional):**  \n   While not strictly necessary, knowing the genre can help the user quickly assess whether the movie aligns with their preferences. Given the user's interest in films that challenge societal norms, genres like drama, dark comedy, or thriller may be particularly relevant.\n\n3. **Themes (optional):**  \n   This attribute captures the central ideas or messages of the movie. Since the user enjoys introspective and rebellious narratives, themes such as identity crisis, societal critique, or anti-establishment sentiments would resonate well. This allows for dynamic adjustments based on the user's evolving interests.\n\n4. **Tone (optional):**  \n   The tone of the movie (e.g., dark, satirical, serious) can provide insight into the emotional experience the user might expect. Given the user's appreciation for dark humor and cynicism, a tone that reflects these qualities would be particularly appealing.\n\n5. **Protagonist Type (optional):**  \n   This attribute describes the nature of the main character (e.g., anti-hero, outsider, rebel). Since the user enjoys films with complex characters who often challenge societal norms, this attribute can help tailor recommendations to their preferences.\n\n6. **Cynicism Level (optional):**  \n   This attribute indicates the degree of cynicism portrayed in the film. Given the user's cynical outlook, movies that feature a high level of cynicism may be more appealing, allowing for nuanced recommendations that align with their worldview.\n\n7. **Dark Humor Elements (optional):**  \n   This attribute specifies whether the movie incorporates dark humor, which is a significant aspect of the user's taste. Including this attribute allows for recommendations that match the user's appreciation for humor that addresses serious themes.\n\n8. **Additional Information (required):**  \n   This attribute serves as a repository for supplementary descriptive details about the movie that are not of primary importance. It can be formatted in JSON to include various aspects such as director, cast, release year, and any other relevant notes that might enhance the user's understanding of the film. \n\nBy structuring the ADT in this way, it allows for a comprehensive yet flexible approach to movie recommendations that cater to the user's specific interests and personality traits.",

It’s not enough to just be edgy, or even malicious. You need to tap into deep, disturbing levels of discomfort… and build a summer home.\n\nWe made the ultimate list of dark comedy movies and TV shows, plus a video essay that takes a deep dive into one dark comedy, The Lobster. Let’s jump into our list of the best dark comedy movies and TV shows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Watch: How to Make a Dark Comedy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubscribe for more filmmaking videos like this.\n\n## Dark Humor Definition\n\n### What makes the best dark comedies?\n\nSome of the movies on this list don't really set out to be dark comedies, but they still make us laugh at things that are truly unfortunate or just plain sad.\n\nSome of the best movies in existence are dark comedies, and they are often built on cynical representations of otherwise dramatic subjects.\n\nOther times, they are films that make us laugh despite being rather accurate representations of society or powerful institutions.\n\n## Dark Comedy Definition\n\n### What is dark comedy?\n\nDark comedy, black comedy or black humor is a sub-genre of comedy where commonly objectionable topics and events are used in a satirical manner as a source of humor in a narrative work. A dark comedy can be a movie, TV show, novel, podcast, or any other form of narrative art.\n\nDark comedies intend to make light of events that would otherwise be considered too painful to discuss. The hope is that viewers will gain a cathartic experience, or simply laugh at some absurd situation.\n\nYou will probably disagree with this list in one way or another. Maybe you don’t think a particular film should be considered a dark comedy.\n\nWe drew a very simple line...\n\n“Do the tragic events on screen make us laugh throughout the film?”\n\nIf the answer was, “yes”, then the film was considered for our list.\n\nWe’ve defined dark humor, so here’s our list of the best dark comedies.\n\n## Related Posts\n\n- Zack Snyder's Directing Style →\n- David Fincher's Directing Style →\n- Wes Anderson's Directing Style →\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 1. Fargo\n\nThe Coen Brothers created this dark comedy about greed and inferiority. The filmmaking techniques in this movie are some of the best ever, and worth study.

Ah jeez.\n\n#### Fargo | Truecoat\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.”\n\n## Best Black Comedies\n\n### 2. American Psycho\n\nMuch like the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, this dark comedy movie directed by Mary Harron shows us that just because we're following a serial killer doesn’t mean the story has to be all gore and gloom.\n\nHold onto you funny bone for this dark comedy. Sorbet?\n\n#### American Psycho Business Card Scene  •  Subscribe on YouTube\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 3. Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nStanley Kubrick directed one of the earliest and truly one of the best dark comedies ever. You can't get much darker than nuclear war, and Kubrick filmed this movie made a single war room cinematic.\n\n#### Dr. Strangelove | Total Commitment\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An insane general triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a War Room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop.”\n\n## Best Black Humor Movies\n\n### 4. Fight Club\n\nThis dark comedy directed by David Fincher could be considered a lot of different things, like one of the greatest films of all time, but it has the great ability to make you laugh at just pure violence.\n\nI haven't laughed like that since grade school.\n\n#### Fight Club | I Wan't You To Hit Me\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 5. Pulp Fiction\n\nThis dark comedy from Quentin Tarantino took the classic crime stories and gave them a twist. Adrenaline shots to the heart, burning pop-tarts, samurai swords, gimps, and speed bumps pave the way for this dark comedy movie that changed cinema forever.\n\n#### Pulp Fiction | Ready, Honey Bunny\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 6. Burn After Reading\n\nThe Coen Brothers are mainstream filmmakers with a dark sense of humor who make dark comedies like no one else. This dark comedy begins like a John Le Carre spy novel but quickly becomes one of the best dark comedy movies of all time.\n\n#### Burn After Reading | Osbourne Is Out\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A disk containing mysterious information from a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous and daft gym employees who attempt to sell it.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 7. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n\nTerry Gilliam can be considered a surrealist filmmaker, and each of his movies has a rich psychological theme attached. This dark comedy is centered around Hunter S. Thompson on assignment in Las Vegas.\n\n#### Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas | Somewhere Around Barstow\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer travel to Las Vegas for a series of psychedelic escapades.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Movies and TV Shows\n\n### 8. The Big Lebowski\n\nThe Coen Brothers attack with one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Quite possibly their best film overall. Think this film should be number one on our dark comedy movie list?\n\nYou know what I say? Mark it zero.\n\n#### The Big Lebowski | I'm The Dude\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski, mistaken for a millionaire of the same name, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it.''\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 9. O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\nThe Coen Brothers show up again with this dark comedy movie that is an adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey. The Coens take one of the earliest stories in history and ask “What if it was meant to be a dark comedy?”\n\n#### O Brother, Where Art Thou? | Your Truly\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “In the deep south during the 1930s, three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawman pursues them.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 10. In Bruges\n\nMartin McDonagh broke onto the scene with this dark comedy. The entire movie is an essay on good, bad, heaven, hell, purgatory... and Bruges. It has definitely earned a place on our list of the best dark comedy movies.\n\n#### In Bruges | A Lollipop Man\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Guilt-stricken after a job gone wrong, hitman Ray and his partner await orders from their ruthless boss in Bruges, Belgium, the last place in the world Ray wants to be.”\n\n## Best Dark Humor Films\n\n### 11. Very Bad Things\n\nThis dark comedy from Peter Berg is one of the best. The rhythm of the edit, the camera movement, and the use of every department to support the theme of dark comedy show why this film is such a classic.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A prostitute is killed during a bachelor party and the attendees turn on each other as the wedding approaches.”\n\n## List of Black Comedy Films\n\n### 12. The Death of Stalin\n\nStalin’s death is far from tragic, but this dark comedy from Armando Iannuci shows us the mad dash for power in a struggling Soviet Union, and how the passing of a “great leader” is a comedy-rich subject.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Moscow, 1953. After being in power for nearly 30 years, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin takes ill and quickly dies. Now the members of the Council of Ministers scramble for power.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 13. Snatch\n\nThe dark comedy directed by Guy Ritchie showed the world how Ritchie commands tone in his films, and much like Wes Anderson or The Coen Brothers, he can jump back and forth more effectively than most.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A disk containing mysterious information from a CIA agent ends up in the hands of two unscrupulous and daft gym employees who attempt to sell it.”\n\n## BEST DARK COMEDIES\n\n### 14. Falling Down\n\nThe dark comedy directed by Joel Schumacher is one of those $25 million dollar films you wish Hollywood would still make. The opening scene may be one of the greatest examples of sound design and emotion.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An unemployed defense worker frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society, begins to psychotically and violently lash out against them.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 15. Birdman\n\nThe dark comedy directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu not only won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but it also made a lot of people laugh at violence, sexual harassment, and Broadway. Dark stuff my friends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Birdman\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A washed-up superhero actor attempts to revive his fading career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway production.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 16. The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nWes Anderson’s dark comedy about a hotel concierge wrongly accused for the murder of his elderly lover may be Anderson’s best film yet. Wes Anderson is a true auteurist filmmaker, and a funny one at that.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous hotel from the fictional Republic of Zubrowka between the first and second World Wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 17. Death to Smoochy\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Danny Devito boasts a really great cast and a great premise. You need directors like Danny Devito who find the comedy in the greed that surrounds children’s entertainment.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A kids show host, Rainbow Randolph, is fired in disgrace while his replacement, Sheldon Mopes, aka Smoochy the Rhino, finds himself a rising star. Unfortunately for Sheldon, the business of kids television isn't all child's play.”\n\n## List of Dark Humor Films\n\n### 18. The Lobster\n\nYorgos Lanthimos directed this dark comedy before The Favourite, and his tone, location, and performances from his actors cement this as one of the best dark comedy movies that really leans into the dark comedy definition.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 19. The Cable Guy\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Ben Stiller follows a normal guy with some mild bravery issues, and a social outcast raised by television. This film is a really great example of how to humanize your antagonist.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A lonely and mentally disturbed cable guy raised on television just wants a new friend, but his target, a designer, rejects him, with bad consequences.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 20. Hot Fuzz\n\nHot Fuzz is the best of the dark comedy movies directed by Edgar Wright, because it is both the darkest and the funniest. This movie may, at times, be a parody of other films... but Wright has reinvented comedic cinema.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Hot Fuzz\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A skilled London police officer is transferred to a small town with a dark secret.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 21. God Bless America\n\nAnother dark comedy from Bobcat Goldthwait that shows, very clearly, what the definition of dark comedy means. Very rarely will you find yourself cheering on the exact person we hate to see in the news.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “On a mission to rid society of its most repellent citizens, terminally ill Frank makes an unlikely accomplice in 16-year-old Roxy.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 22. Raising Arizona\n\nThis is one of the first dark comedies from The Coen Brothers, and it is one of the more sadistic to boot. Nick Cage is great, The Coens really dipped into stylistic filmmaking that they scale back for later films, but never lose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Raising Arizona\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “When a childless couple of an ex-con and an ex-cop decide to help themselves to one of another family's quintuplets, their lives become more complicated than they anticipated.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 23. American Beauty\n\nSam Mendes directs this dark comedy that proved to producers that he could handle other laugh riots like... Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Revolutionary Road and a few James Bond movies. Stars Kevin Spacey.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A sexually frustrated suburban father has a midlife crisis after becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 24. Thank You For Smoking\n\nJason Reitman directs this dark comedy that defends the world of big tobacco or at least one human behind big tobacco. He uses cinema and cutaways in a very clever way to add the necessary style to this movie.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Thank You for Smoking\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Satirical comedy follows the machinations of Big Tobacco's chief spokesman, Nick Naylor, who spins on behalf of cigarettes while trying to remain a role model for his twelve-year-old son.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 25. Election\n\nAlexander Payne directs this dark comedy about a high school class election and shows why he is one of the best American comedy directors working today. Payne would then direct Sideways and The Descendants.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A high school teacher's personal life becomes complicated as he works with students during the school elections, particularly with an obsessive overachiever determined to become student body president.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 26. Trainspotting\n\nDanny Boyle directs this dark comedy that took junkie culture and made it both funny and a bit hard to watch… so I guess that’s just junkie culture. Double feature this with Requiem for a Dream for a fun night.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Renton, deeply immersed in the Edinburgh drug scene, tries to clean up and get out, despite the allure of the drugs and the influence of friends.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 27. Adaptation\n\nSpike Jonze directs this dark comedy that allowed the world to finally get what it had been wanting for years… two servings of Nick Cage. This is another great dark comedy that also has a heart.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A lovelorn screenwriter becomes desperate as he tries and fails to adapt 'The Orchid Thief' by Susan Orlean for the screen.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 28. Seven Psychopaths\n\nMartin McDonagh makes his second appearance on this list with this dark comedy. He plays with cinema and screenwriting in a rather unique way and gives some nice variety from In Bruges… minus Colin Farrell.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A struggling screenwriter inadvertently becomes entangled in the Los Angeles criminal underworld after his oddball friends kidnap a gangster's beloved Shih Tzu.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 29. Monty Python's Life of Brian\n\nTerry Jones directs this dark comedy about Christianity and shows how a few changes in history could have resulted in a quarter of the world worshipping a dude named Brian. Always look on the bright side of life.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Born on the original Christmas in the stable next door to Jesus, Brian of Nazareth spends his life being mistaken for a messiah.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 30. A Clockwork Orange\n\nStanley Kubrick directs one of the more fringe dark comedies on this list, not because of the subject matter, but rather the approach. This movie is funny… but I wouldn’t blame you if you squint and tilt your head right now.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### A Clockwork Orange\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “In the future, a sadistic gang leader is imprisoned and volunteers for a conduct-aversion experiment, but it doesn't go as planned.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 31. The Royal Tenenbaums\n\nCall back stabbings, BBs lodged in the skin, and a HILARIOUS shaving scene are just some of the funny moments you’ll find in this dark comedy movie directed by Wes Anderson. Do you speak for everybody?\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The eccentric members of a dysfunctional family reluctantly gather under the same roof for various reasons.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 32. Barton Fink\n\nBarton Fink may not be the best of the dark comedies directed by The Coen Brothers, but it definitely set the stage.

Shaun of the Dead\n\nEdgar Wright directs this dark comedy that shows the early signs of a true auteur.

Throw Momma From The Train\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Danny Devito is sort of a meta-parody of Strangers on a Train. This movie makes great use of angles and cinematic gags to amplify the awkward moments into some true comedy.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A bitter ex-husband wants his former spouse dead. A put-upon momma's boy wants his mother dead. Who will pull it off?”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 39.

Being John Malkovich\n\nSpike Jonez directs this dark comedy written by Charlie Kaufman that shows why Jonez made the leap from skate videos and music videos into feature films, and helped change how we look at surreal directing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Being John Malkovich\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of movie star John Malkovich.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 41. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\n\nDirected by Shane Black, this dark comedy is a great example of how dark comedies can also have a bit of a heart, and a bit of mystery. This dark comedy has something for everyone, so put it on your list.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A murder mystery brings together a private eye, a struggling actress, and a thief masquerading as an actor.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 42. Death at a Funeral\n\nFrank Oz directs this dark comedy that takes the ultimate taboo subject, death, and builds a celebration of comedy. This movie uses many of the space and blocking to keep the entire funeral connected to the comedy.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Chaos ensues when a man tries to expose a dark secret regarding a recently deceased patriarch of a dysfunctional British family.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 43. The Foot Fist Way\n\nJody Hill came onto the scene with this dark comedy starring Danny McBride, and brought a truly uncomfortable experience to the screen. Truly tragic and truly funny, a film to be studied by young directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### The Foot Fist Way\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “An inept tae kwon do instructor struggles with marital troubles and an unhealthy obsession with fellow tae kwon do enthusiast Chuck \"The Truck\" Wallace.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 44. Matchstick Men\n\nThis dark comedy from Ridley Scott is not only a really well written film, but it is the go-to movie for anyone who wants to see how advanced film language can really help to build a great dark comedy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Matchstick Men\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A phobic con artist and his protégé are on the verge of pulling off a lucrative swindle when the former's teenage daughter arrives unexpectedly.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 45. Heathers\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Michael Lehmann is all about a plot to kill the cool kids at school. Recently a Heathers TV show was created, but shelved because it was considered too inflammatory for release.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Heathers\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “In order to get out of the snobby clique that is destroying her good-girl reputation, an intelligent teen teams up with a dark sociopath in a plot to kill the cool kids.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 46. Stretch\n\nJoe Carnahan directs this comedy after years of making action films, and the experience shows. This is a great movie if you want to see how to blend fun, exciting sequences with gallows humor and a dark comedy spin.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Stretch\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A hard-luck limo driver struggles to go straight and pay off a debt to his bookie. He takes on a job with a crazed passenger, whose sought-after ledger implicates some seriously dangerous criminals.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 47. Observe and Report\n\nThis dark comedy from Jody Hill shows us Seth Rogen at his darkest. The main success of this film was having a group of characters who were unlikeable, had poor (but clear) motivations, and frightfully accurate.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Bi-polar mall security guard Ronnie Barnhardt is called into action to stop a flasher from turning shopper's paradise into his personal peep show. But when Barnhardt can't bring the culprit to justice, a surly police detective is recruited to close the case.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 48. Happiness\n\nTodd Solondz directs this film that is one of the best examples of a dark comedy movie that you will ever find. Solondz understands that terrible situations and pure truth are some of the quickest paths to cringe worthy laughs.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The lives of several individuals intertwine as they go about their lives in their own unique ways, engaging in acts society as a whole might find disturbing in a desperate search for human connection.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 49. Choke\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Clark Gregg (took a sabbatical from S.H.I.E.L.D) and written by Chuck Palahniuk (Fight Club) is a great example of a true dark comedy. This movie was better than the reception.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “A sex-addicted con-man pays for his mother's hospital bills by playing on the sympathies of those who rescue him from choking to death.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 50. Super\n\nThis dark comedy directed by James Gunn stars Rainn Wilson as a defeated ex-husband who just wants his wife back. This film would oddly lead to Gunn directing The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 &amp; 2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Super\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “After his wife falls under the influence of a drug dealer, an everyday guy transforms himself into Crimson Bolt, a superhero with the best intentions, but lacking in heroic skills.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedy Movies\n\n### 51. Grosse Pointe Blank\n\nThis dark comedy from George Armitage is a great example of a dark comedy that is also a romantic comedy. It takes such a different approach to dark comedy that cuts against the tone of many films on this list.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “Martin Blank is a professional assassin. He is sent on a mission to a small Detroit suburb, Grosse Pointe, and, by coincidence, his ten-year high school reunion party is taking place there at the same time.”\n\n## Best Dark Comedies\n\n### 52. The Rules of Attraction\n\nThis dark comedy directed by Roger Avary is… not as good as American Psycho, but it definitely doesn’t hide. If you’ve ever had a doubt about youth and their complicity in their own problems, watch this film.\n\nIMDB Synopsis: “The incredibly spoiled and overprivileged students of Camden College are a backdrop for an unusual love triangle between a drug dealer, a virgin and a bisexual classmate.”\n\n## List of Dark Comedy Films\n\n### 53.

                "Summary": "Taxi Driver is a 1976 American neo-noir psychological drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader. Set in a morally decaying New York City following the Vietnam War, it stars Robert De Niro as veteran Marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle, whose mental state deteriorates as he works nights in the city. The film also stars Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks in his first film role.",
                "Production": "With The Wrong Man (1956) and A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences. Filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed for the film what would be his final score; the music was finished just hours before his death, and the film is dedicated to him.",
                "Release": "Theatrically released by Columbia Pictures on February 8, 1976, the film was critically and commercially successful despite generating controversy both for its graphic violence in the climactic ending and for the casting of then 12-year-old Foster as a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for De Niro), and Best Supporting Actress (for Foster).",
                "Controversies": "Although Taxi Driver generated further controversy for inspiring John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the film has remained popular. It is considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time, garnering cult status. In 2022, Sight & Sound named it the 29th-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, and the 12th-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll, tied with Barry Lyndon. In 1994, the film was considered 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically' significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.",
                "Plot": "In New York City, Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequenting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms such as 'you're only as healthy as you feel.' He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses in the city and dreams about getting 'the scum off the streets.'",

It's not for everyone due to its extreme graphic (if quite over the top) violence and frenetic filming style, but I find it's a brilliant satire that rings more true than ever these days with its commentary and ultimately condemnation on the media's irresponsible habit of glorifying murderers and making them into celebrities. It was something timely and relevant even at the time it was made thanks to tabloid journalism, and it eerily feels more so now thanks to social media and how anyone can be a celebrity and have a following no matter what a terrible person they are."

                "description": "Moonlight is a 2016 American coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Barry Jenkins, based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unpublished semi-autobiographical play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. It stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe in her first film appearance, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali. The film presents three stages in the life of the main character: his childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. It explores the difficulties he faces with his homosexuality and identity as a black homosexual man, including the physical and emotional abuse he endures growing up. Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by A24, receiving critical acclaim with praise towards its editing, cinematography, score, Jenkins's direction and screenplay, and handling of the themes of sexuality and masculinity. Moonlight has been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture—along with Best Supporting Actor (Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay—from a total of eight nominations, at the 89th Academy Awards."

First of all, that one second isn't a second at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time... For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars... And yellow leaves, from the maple trees, that lined our street... Or my grandmother's hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper... And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's brand new Firebird... And Janie... And Janie... And... Carolyn. I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry... you will someday.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe end credits gives thanks to the Donmar Warehouse in London and Dr. Bill and Alice.

The idea and concept of \"American Beauty\" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.\n\nKevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves \"the precious moments in his stupid little life.\" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.\n\nAnnete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is \"in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times\". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.\n\nThe supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.\n\nThe most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says \"I'm sorry, what?\". Ricky says \"Mom, no one said anything\". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says \"Mom, I'm leaving\". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says \"OK. Wear a raincoat\". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.\n\nIf there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think.

The idea and concept of \"American Beauty\" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.\n                Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a middle-aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a loser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances.

When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace things as \"How was your weekend?\" Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel.\n\n- Goofs(at around 1h 15 mins) When The Mechanic (Holt McCallany) sprays the Seminary Student (Matt Winston) with a hose, the camera briefly shakes because the cameraman was laughing uncontrollably.\n\n- QuotesTyler Durden: [31:14] The things you own end up owning you.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe warning at the beginning of the DVD, after the copyright warnings\nreads:\nWARNING\nIf you are reading this then this warning is for you.

After the trial, Tyler was sent to lunatic asylum [sic] receiving psychological treatment. He was discharged from the hospital in 2012.\" After this ending gained press notice, drawing attention to Chinese censorship, the original ending was reinstated.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into The Arrivals (2008)\n\n- SoundtracksCoffee Shop Zak\nComposed by Rolfe Kent\nCourtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\n\n### User reviews4.6K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Watch it atleast twice\n\nBeleive me if you want to feel this movie to the core watch it twice .

The film was based on Raymond Carver's 1978 short story \"Why Don't You Dance?\" and was released in theaters on May 13, 2011.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn Arcadia, Arizona, salesman Nick Halsey is fired from his job of 16 years following an incident in Denver related to his alcoholism. After stabbing his supervisor Gary’s tires with his farewell gift – a Swiss Army Knife with his name on it – but leaving it behind, Nick has a confrontation with teenagers outside a convenience store. He returns home to find his wife Catherine is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings are strewn all over his lawn; she has left a letter explaining that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and not to contact her.\n\nAfter spending the night on the lawn, Nick meets his new pregnant neighbor, Samantha, and pays a neighborhood boy named Kenny to watch his things. He discovers that he has been cut off from his credit cards, joint bank account, and phone service, and his company car is taken back. Almost arrested when the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick has them contact his AA sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia, who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on.\n\nNick gets Kenny to help him sell his possessions, promising to pay him and teach him to play baseball but is initially unwilling to let items go. He bonds with Samantha, who is still waiting for her husband to join her at their new house. Nick reveals that he had been sober for six months until a business trip to Denver, where he got blackout drunk with a female colleague; he awoke with no memory of the night before, but she lodged a complaint against him, leading to his firing.\n\nFinding a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah, Nick tracks her down; their reunion is awkward, but Delilah tells Nick he still has a good heart. Out of money and alcohol, Nick experiences withdrawal. Samantha brings him Valium and tells him to seek help, but Nick replies that she is no better than him for putting up with her husband’s drinking and frequent absences, and she storms off.\n\nNick awakens to find Kenny has arranged his belongings with thoughtful price tags, and they sell almost everything. Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits he was right and has told her husband to either come home or get a divorce. She, Nick, and Kenny go out to dinner, where Nick runs into Gary, who reveals that the Denver incident probably did not happen: the female employee was fired for having a history of suing coworkers for sexual harassment, and Nick would likely have gotten his job back if he had not slashed Gary’s tires. When Gary leaves his beer behind, Nick refrains from drinking and returns it to him.\n\nVisiting Frank at his office, Nick answers a call on Frank’s phone from Catherine. He confronts Frank, who admits Catherine has been staying with him; they fight, and Frank declares that Catherine deserves better than Nick. Driving him home, Frank observes that Nick’s marriage was bound to fail, and gives him Catherine’s divorce papers to sign, along with some money and the keys to Nick’s house.

After stabbing his supervisor Gary’s tires with his farewell gift – a Swiss Army Knife with his name on it – but leaving it behind, Nick has a confrontation with teenagers outside a convenience store. He returns home to find his wife Catherine is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings are strewn all over his lawn; she has left a letter explaining that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and not to contact her.\n        \n        After spending the night on the lawn, Nick meets his new pregnant neighbor, Samantha, and pays a neighborhood boy named Kenny to watch his things. He discovers that he has been cut off from his credit cards, joint bank account, and phone service, and his company car is taken back. Almost arrested when the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick has them contact his AA sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia, who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on.\n        \n        Nick gets Kenny to help him sell his possessions, promising to pay him and teach him to play baseball but is initially unwilling to let items go. He bonds with Samantha, who is still waiting for her husband to join her at their new house. Nick reveals that he had been sober for six months until a business trip to Denver, where he got blackout drunk with a female colleague; he awoke with no memory of the night before, but she lodged a complaint against him, leading to his firing.\n        \n        Finding a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah, Nick tracks her down; their reunion is awkward, but Delilah tells Nick he still has a good heart. Out of money and alcohol, Nick experiences withdrawal. Samantha brings him Valium and tells him to seek help, but Nick replies that she is no better than him for putting up with her husband’s drinking and frequent absences, and she storms off.\n        \n        Nick awakens to find Kenny has arranged his belongings with thoughtful price tags, and they sell almost everything. Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits he was right and has told her husband to either come home or get a divorce. She, Nick, and Kenny go out to dinner, where Nick runs into Gary, who reveals that the Denver incident probably did not happen: the female employee was fired for having a history of suing coworkers for sexual harassment, and Nick would likely have gotten his job back if he had not slashed Gary’s tires. When Gary leaves his beer behind, Nick refrains from drinking and returns it to him.\n        \n        Visiting Frank at his office, Nick answers a call on Frank’s phone from Catherine. He confronts Frank, who admits Catherine has been staying with him; they fight, and Frank declares that Catherine deserves better than Nick. Driving him home, Frank observes that Nick’s marriage was bound to fail, and gives him Catherine’s divorce papers to sign, along with some money and the keys to Nick’s house. Asking Frank to tell his wife he is sorry, Nick walks home; he almost stops at the convenience store where he regularly bought beer, but moves on and spends the night in his old bed.\n        \n        The next day, he pays Kenny – including what he skimmed for beer money – and receives an appreciative hug from Samantha, whose husband has come home.

Set in a morally decaying New York City following the Vietnam War, it stars Robert De Niro as veteran Marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle, whose mental state deteriorates as he works nights in the city. The film also stars Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks in his first film role.\n\nWith The Wrong Man (1956) and A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences.[citation needed] Filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed for the film what would be his final score; the music was finished just hours before his death, and the film is dedicated to him.\n\nTheatrically released by Columbia Pictures on February 8, 1976, the film was critically and commercially successful despite generating controversy both for its graphic violence in the climactic ending and for the casting of then 12-year-old Foster as a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for De Niro), and Best Supporting Actress (for Foster).\n\nAlthough Taxi Driver generated further controversy for inspiring John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the film has remained popular. It is considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time, garnering cult status.[8] In 2022, Sight &amp; Sound named it the 29th-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, and the 12th-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll, tied with Barry Lyndon. In 1994, the film was considered \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically\" significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn New York City, Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequenting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms such as \"you're only as healthy as you feel.\" He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses in the city and dreams about getting \"the scum off the streets.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Travis enters the campaign office where she works and asks her out for coffee, to which she agrees. Betsy agrees to go on another date with him. During their date, Travis takes Betsy to a porn theater, which she leaves. He attempts to reconcile with her, but fails. Enraged, he storms into the campaign office where she works and proceeds to berate her before being kicked out of the office.\n\nExperiencing an existential crisis and seeing various acts of prostitution throughout the city, Travis confides in a fellow taxi driver nicknamed Wizard about his violent thoughts. However, Wizard dismisses them and assures him that he will be fine. To find an outlet for his rage, Travis follows an intense physical training regimen. He gets in contact with black market gun dealer Easy Andy, and buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices drawing his weapons, even creating a quick-draw rig hidden in his sleeve. He begins attending Palantine's rallies to scope out his security. One night, Travis shoots and kills a man attempting to rob a convenience store run by a friend of his.\n\nOn his trips around the city, Travis regularly encounters Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute. Tricking her pimp and abusive lover, Sport, into thinking he wants to solicit her, Travis meets with her in private and tries to persuade her to stop prostituting herself. Soon after, Travis shaves his hair into a mohawk and attends a public rally where he plans to assassinate Palantine. However, Secret Service agents see Travis putting his hand inside his jacket and approach him, escalating into a chase. Travis escapes pursuit and makes it home undetected.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to the brothel where Iris works to kill Sport. He enters the building and shoots Sport and one of Iris's clients, a mafioso. Travis is shot several times, but manages to kill the two men. He then fights with the bouncer, who he manages to stab through the hand with his knife and kill with a gunshot to the head. Travis attempts to commit suicide, but is out of bullets. Severely injured, he slumps on a couch next to a sobbing Iris. As police respond to the scene, Travis imitates shooting himself in the head using his finger.\n\nTravis goes into a coma due to his injuries. He is heralded by the press as a heroic vigilante and not prosecuted for the murders. He receives a letter from Iris's parents in Pittsburgh, who thank him and reveal that she is safe and attending school back home.\n\nAfter recovering, Travis grows his hair out and returns to work, where he encounters Betsy as a fare; they interact, with Betsy saying she followed his story in the newspapers. Travis drops her at home, and declines to take her money, driving off with a smile. He suddenly becomes agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror, but continues driving into the night.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle\n- Jodie Foster as Iris Steensma\n- Cybill Shepherd as Betsy\n- Harvey Keitel as Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins\n- Albert Brooks as Tom\n- Leonard Harris as Senator Charles Palantine\n- Peter Boyle as \"Wizard\"\n- Steven Prince as \"Easy Andy\", the Gun Salesman\n- Martin Scorsese as \"Passenger Watching Silhouette\"/Man Outside Palantine Headquarters\n- Harry Northup as \"Doughboy\"\n- Victor Argo as Melio, the Bodega Clerk\n- Joe Spinell as The Personnel Officer\n\n[1][9]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nMartin Scorsese has stated that it was Brian De Palma who introduced him to Paul Schrader,[10] and Taxi Driver arose from Scorsese's feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to evoke within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. Scorsese cites Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man (1956) and Jack Hazan's A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.[11] Before Scorsese was hired, John Milius and Irvin Kershner were considered to helm the project.[12] In writing the script, Schrader drew inspiration from the diaries of Arthur Bremer, who shot presidential candidate George Wallace in 1972,[13] as well as from the Harry Chapin song \"Taxi\", which is about an old girlfriend getting into a cab.[14] For the ending of the story, in which Bickle becomes a media hero, Schrader was inspired by Sara Jane Moore's attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford, which resulted in her being on the cover of Newsweek.[15]\n\nSchrader also used himself as inspiration. In a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on The Tomorrow Show, he related his experience of living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a stomach ulcer, Schrader wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver in \"under a fortnight.\" He states, \"The first draft was maybe 60 pages, and I started the next draft immediately, and it took less than two weeks.\" Schrader recalls, \"I realized I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks [...] that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating around the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the national trauma of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.[16] Two drafts were written in ten days.[17] Pickpocket, a film by the French director Robert Bresson, was also cited as an influence.[18]\n\nIn Scorsese on Scorsese, Scorsese mentions the religious symbolism in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the samurai's \"death with honor\" principle.[11] Dustin Hoffman was offered the role of Travis Bickle but turned it down because he thought that Scorsese was \"crazy\".[19] Al Pacino and Jeff Bridges were also considered for Travis Bickle.[12]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break, would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks before returning to Rome to resume filming 1900. Although Robert DeNiro had already starred in Godfather II (1974), he was only recognized one time while driving a cab in New York City.[20] De Niro apparently lost 16 kilograms (35 pounds) and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of criminal Arthur Bremer. When he had time off from shooting 1900, De Niro visited an army base in Northern Italy and tape-recorded soldiers from the Midwestern United States, whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.[21]\n\nScorsese brought in the film title designer Dan Perri to design the title sequence for Taxi Driver. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in 1974, but Warner Bros would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time Taxi Driver was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on The Exorcist, and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for Taxi Driver using second unit footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and slit-scan, resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing neon signs, distorted nocturnal images, and deep black levels. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this, including Star Wars (1977) and Raging Bull (1980).[22][23]\n\n### Filming\n\nColumbia Pictures gave Scorsese a budget of $1.3 million in April 1974.[10] On a budget of only $1.9 million, various actors took pay cuts to bring the project to life. De Niro and Cybill Shepherd received only $35,000 to make the film, while Scorsese was given $65,000. Overall, $200,000 of the budget was allocated to performers in the movie.[3][24]\n\nTaxi Driver was shot during a New York City summer heat wave and sanitation strike in 1975. The film ran into conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) due to its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the colors in the final shootout, which allowed the film to get an R rating. To capture the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound technicians would get in the trunk while Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman later admitted the filming style was heavily influenced by New Wave filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard, as the crew did not have the time or money to do \"traditional things\".[25] When Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a mohawk. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted that Magnotta told them that, \"in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved—like a little Mohawk—that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them. They were ready to kill.\"[13]\n\nFilming took place on New York City's West Side, at a time when the city was on the brink of bankruptcy. According to producer Michael Phillips, \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets [...] we didn't know we were documenting what looked like the dying gasp of New York.\"[26] The tracking shot over the shootout scene, filmed in an actual apartment, took three months of preparation; the production team had to cut through the ceiling to shoot it.[27]\n\n## Music\n\n| Taxi Driver: Original Soundtrack Recording   | Taxi Driver: Original Soundtrack Recording   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Soundtrack album by Bernard Herrmann         | Soundtrack album by Bernard Herrmann         |\n| Released                                     | May 19, 1998                                 |\n| Recorded                                     | December 22 and 23, 1975[28]                 |\n| Genre                                        | Soundtrack                                   |\n| Length                                       | 61:33                                        |\n| Label                                        | Arista                                       |\n| Producer                                     | Michael Phillips, Neely Plumb                |\n\n| Review scores   | Review scores   |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Source          | Rating          |\n| AllMusic        | [29]            |\n\nBernard Herrmann previously scored De Palma's Obsession and De Palma introduced Herrmann to Scorsese.[30] The music by Herrmann was his final score before his death on December 24, 1975, several hours after Herrmann completed the recording for the soundtrack, and the film is dedicated to his memory. Scorsese, a long-time admirer of Herrmann, had particularly wanted him to compose the score; Herrmann was his \"first and only choice\". Scorsese considered Herrmann's score of great importance to the success of the film: \"It supplied the psychological basis throughout.\"[31] The album The Silver Tongued Devil and I from Kris Kristofferson was used in the film, following Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) where Kristofferson played a supporting role.[32] Jackson Browne's \"Late for the Sky\" is also featured.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Casting of Jodie Foster\n\nSome critics showed concern over 12-year-old Foster's presence during the climactic shoot-out.[33] Foster said that she was present during the setup and staging of the special effects used during the scene; the entire process was explained and demonstrated for her, step by step. Moreover, Foster said, she was fascinated and entertained by the behind-the-scenes preparation that went into the scene. In addition, before being given the part, Foster was subjected to psychological testing, attending sessions with a UCLA psychiatrist, to ensure that she would not be emotionally scarred by her role, in accordance with California Labor Board requirements monitoring children's welfare on film sets.[34][35]\n\nAdditional concerns surrounding Foster's age focus on the role she played as Iris, a prostitute. Years later, she confessed how uncomfortable the treatment of her character was on set. Scorsese did not know how to approach different scenes with the actress. The director relied on Robert De Niro to deliver his directions to the young actress. Foster often expressed how De Niro, in that moment, became a mentor to her, stating that her acting career was highly influenced by the actor's advice during the filming of Taxi Driver.[36]\n\n### John Hinckley Jr.\n\nTaxi Driver formed part of the delusional fantasy of John Hinckley Jr.[37] that triggered his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, an act for which he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.[38] Hinckley stated that his actions were an attempt to impress Foster, on whom Hinckley was fixated, by mimicking Travis's mohawked appearance at the Palantine rally. His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.[39][40] When Scorsese heard about Hinckley's motivation behind his assassination attempt, he briefly thought about quitting film-making as the association brought a negative perception of the film.[41]\n\n### MPAA rating\n\nThe climactic shoot-out was considered intensely graphic by some critics, who even considered giving the film an X rating.[42] The film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival for its graphic violence.[43] To obtain an R rating, Scorsese had the colors desaturated, making the brightly colored blood less prominent. In later interviews, Scorsese commented that he was pleased by the color change and considered it an improvement over the original scene.[44] However, in the special-edition DVD, Michael Chapman, the film's cinematographer, expresses regret about the decision and the fact that no print with the unmuted colors exists anymore, as the originals had long since deteriorated.\n\n## Themes and interpretations\n\nRoger Ebert has written of the film's ending:\n\nThere has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's \"heroism\" of saving Iris, and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters. They despise themselves, they live in sin, they occupy mean streets, but they want to be forgiven and admired.[45]\n\nJames Berardinelli, in his review of the film, argues against the dream or fantasy interpretation, stating:\n\nScorsese and writer Paul Schrader append the perfect conclusion to Taxi Driver. Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores the vagaries of fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, he would have been reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl.[46]\n\nIn the 1990 LaserDisc audio commentary (included on the [DVD] and Blu-ray), Scorsese acknowledged several critics' interpretation of the film's ending as Bickle's dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that Bickle will fall into rage and recklessness in the future and that he is like \"a ticking time bomb\".[47] Writer Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis \"is not cured by the movie's end,\" and that \"he's not going to be a hero next time.\"[48] When asked on the website Reddit about the film's ending, Schrader said that it was not to be taken as a dream sequence but that he envisioned it as returning to the beginning of the film, as if the last frame \"could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again.\"[49]\n\nThe film has also been associated with the 1970s wave of vigilante films, but it has also been set apart from them as a more reputable New Hollywood film. While it shares similarities with those films,[50] it is not explicitly a vigilante film and does not belong to that particular wave of cinema.[51]\n\nThe film can be seen as a spiritual successor to The Searchers, according to Roger Ebert. Both films focus on a solitary war veteran who tries to save a young girl who is resistant to his efforts. The main characters in both movies are portrayed as being disconnected from society and incapable of forming normal relationships with others. Although it is unclear whether Paul Schrader sought inspiration from The Searchers specifically, the similarities between the two films are evident.[52]\n\nThe film has been labeled as \"neo-noir\" by some critics,[53][54] while others have referred to it as an antihero film.[55][56] When shown on television, the ending credits featured a black screen with a disclaimer mentioning that \"the distinction between hero and villain is sometimes a matter of interpretation or misinterpretation of facts.\" This disclaimer was thought to have been added after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981, but in fact, it had been mentioned in a review of the film as early as 1979. LA Weekly, Letterboxd, and Yardbarker list this movie as belonging to the vetsploitation subgenre.[57][58][59]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film opened at the Coronet Theater in New York City and grossed a house record of $68,000 in its first week.[60] It went on to gross $28.3 million in the United States,[61] making it the 17th-highest-grossing film of 1976.\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performances of  and  garnered universal critical acclaim, earning them  nominations for  and  respectively.\n\nTaxi Driver received universal critical acclaim. Roger Ebert instantly praised it as one of the greatest films he had ever seen, claiming:\n\nTaxi Driver is a hell, from the opening shot of a cab emerging from stygian clouds of steam to the climactic killing scene in which the camera finally looks straight down. Scorsese wanted to look away from Travis's rejection; we almost want to look away from his life. But he's there, all right, and he's suffering.[62]\n\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 158 reviews and an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.\"[63] Metacritic gives the film a score of 94 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[64]\n\nTaxi Driver was ranked by the American Film Institute as the 52nd-greatest American film on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list, and Bickle was voted the 30th-greatest villain in a poll by the same organization. The Village Voice ranked Taxi Driver at number 33 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.[65] Empire also ranked him 18th in its \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll,[66] and the film ranks at No. 17 on the magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[67]\n\nTime Out magazine conducted a poll of the 100 greatest movies set in New York City. Taxi Driver topped the list, placing at No. 1.[68] Schrader's screenplay for the film was ranked the 43rd-greatest ever written by the Writers Guild of America.[69] Taxi Driver was also ranked as the 44th best-directed film of all time by the Directors Guild of America.[70] In contrast, Leonard Maltin gave a rating of only 2 stars and called it a \"gory, cold-blooded story of a sick man's lurid descent into violence\" that was \"ugly and unredeeming\".[71]\n\nIn 2012, in a Sight &amp; Sound poll, Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi selected Taxi Driver as one of his 10 best films of all time.[72] Quentin Tarantino also listed the movie among his 10 greatest films of all time.[73]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                       | Category

Driver ranked 19th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.[90]\n\n## Legacy\n\nTaxi Driver, American Gigolo, Light Sleeper, and The Walker make up a series referred to variously as the \"Man in a Room\" or \"Night Worker\" films. Screenwriter Paul Schrader (who directed the latter three films) has said that he considers the central characters of the four films to be one character, who has changed as he has aged.[91][92] The film also influenced the Charles Winkler film You Talkin' to Me?[93]\n\nAlthough Meryl Streep had not aspired to become a film actor, De Niro's performance in Taxi Driver had a profound impact on her; she said to herself, \"That's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up.\"[94]\n\nThe 1994 portrayal of psychopath Albie Kinsella by Robert Carlyle in British television series Cracker was in part inspired by Travis Bickle, and Carlyle's performance has frequently been compared to De Niro's as a result.[95][96]\n\nIn the 2012 film Seven Psychopaths, psychotic Los Angeles actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) believes himself to be the illegitimate son of Travis Bickle.[97]\n\nThe vigilante ending inspired Jacques Audiard for his 2015 Palme d'Or-winning film Dheepan. The French director based the eponymous Tamil Tiger character on the one played by Robert De Niro in order to make him a \"real movie hero\".[98] The script of Joker by Todd Phillips also draws inspiration from Taxi Driver.[99][100][101]\n\n### \"You talkin' to me?\"\n\nDe Niro's \"You talkin' to me?\" speech has become a pop culture mainstay. In 2005, it was ranked number 10 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.\n\nIn the relevant scene, the deranged Bickle is looking into a mirror at himself, imagining a confrontation that would give him a chance to draw his gun:\n\nYou talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Then who the hell else are you talkin' to? You talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?\n\nWhile Scorsese said that he drew inspiration from John Huston's 1967 movie Reflections in a Golden Eye in a scene in which Marlon Brando's character is facing the mirror,[102] screenwriter Paul Schrader said De Niro improvised the dialogue and that De Niro's performance was inspired by \"an underground New York comedian\" he had once seen, possibly including his signature line.[103] Roger Ebert said of the latter part of the phrase \"I'm the only one here\" that it was \"the truest line in the film.... Travis Bickle's desperate need to make some kind of contact somehow—to share or mimic the effortless social interaction he sees all around him, but does not participate in.\"[104] In his 2009 memoir, saxophonist Clarence Clemons said that De Niro explained the line's origins during production of New York, New York (1977), with the actor seeing Bruce Springsteen say the line onstage at a concert.[105] In the 2000 film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, De Niro went on to repeat the monologue with some alterations in the role of the character Fearless Leader.[106]\n\n## Home media\n\nThe first Collector's Edition DVD, which was released in 1999, was packaged as a single-disc edition. It contained special features such as behind-the-scenes footage and several trailers, including one for Taxi Driver.\n\nIn 2006, a 30th-anniversary two-disc \"Collector's Edition\" DVD was released. The first disc contains the film itself, two audio commentaries (one by writer Schrader and the other by Professor Robert Kolker), and trailers. This edition also includes some of the special features from the earlier release on the second disc, as well as some newly produced documentary material.[107][108]\n\nTo commemorate the film's 35th anniversary, a Blu-ray was released on April 5, 2011. It includes the special features from the previous two-disc collector's edition, plus an audio commentary by Scorsese that was released in 1991 for the Criterion Collection, which was previously released on LaserDisc.[109]\n\nAs part of the Blu-ray production, Sony gave the film a full 4K digital restoration, which included scanning and cleaning the original negative (removing emulsion dirt and scratches). Colors were matched to director-approved prints under guidance from Scorsese and director of photography Michael Chapman. An all-new lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack was also created from the original stereo recordings by Scorsese's personal sound team.[110][111] The restored print premiered in February 2011 at the Berlin Film Festival. To promote the Blu-ray, Sony also had the print screened at AMC Theatres across the United States on March 19 and 22.[112][113][114]\n\n## Possible sequel and remake\n\nIn late January 2005, De Niro and Scorsese announced a sequel.[115] At a 25th-anniversary screening of Raging Bull, De Niro talked about the development of a story featuring an older Travis Bickle. In 2000, De Niro expressed interest in bringing back the character in a conversation with Actors Studio host James Lipton.[116] In November 2013, he revealed that Schrader had written a first draft, but both he and Scorsese thought it was not good enough to proceed.[117]\n\nSchrader disputed this in a 2024 interview, saying, \"Robert is the one who wanted to do that. He asked Marty and I. [...] So he pressed Marty on it and Marty asked me and I said, 'Marty, that’s the worst fucking idea I’ve ever heard.' He said, 'Yeah, but you tell him. Let’s have dinner.' So we had dinner at Bob’s restaurant and Bob was talking about it. I said, 'Wow, that’s the worst fucking idea I’ve ever heard. That character dies at the end of that movie or dies shortly thereafter. He’s gone. Oh, but maybe there is a version of him that I could do. Maybe he became Ted Kaczynski and maybe he’s in a cabin somewhere and just sitting there, making letter bombs. Now, that would be cool. That would be a nice Travis. He doesn’t have a cab anymore. He just sits there [Laughs] making letter bombs.' But Bob didn’t cotton to that idea, either.\"[118]\n\nIn 2010, Variety reported rumors that Lars von Trier, Scorsese, and De Niro planned to work on a remake of the film with the same restrictions used in The Five Obstructions.[119] However, in 2014, Paul Schrader said that the remake was not being made. He commented, \"It was a terrible idea\" and \"in Marty's mind, it never was something that should be done.\"[120]\n\n## See also\n\n- Martin Scorsese filmography\n- 1976 in film\n- List of cult films\n- List of films featuring psychopaths and sociopaths\n- List of films set in New York City\n- Crime in New York City\n- History of the United States (1964–1980)\n    - History of New York City (1946–1977)\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Posthumous nomination.\n- ^ a b Posthumous award.\n- ^ Posthumous nomination\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"AFI|Catalog - Taxi Driver\". catalog.afi.com.

Set in a morally decaying New York City following the Vietnam War, it stars Robert De Niro as veteran Marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle, whose mental state deteriorates as he works nights in the city.

In 2022, Sight & Sound named it the 29th-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, and the 12th-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll, tied with Barry Lyndon.

He thought it would be horrible if humanity was like this in the future.\n\n- Goofs(at around 55 mins) In the montage following his initiative to irrigate the crops with water rather than Gatorade, the crowd chant \"Joe, Joe\". But they all know him by the name \"Not Sure\".\n\n- Quotes[first lines] Narrator: As the twenty-first century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But, as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.\n\n- Crazy creditsAfter the credits there is a scene in which Upgrayedd arrives into the\nfuture to look for Rita.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in The Chibi Project: Sailor Soldiers vs Fresnel Lens (2007)\n\n- SoundtracksTrio Sonata No. 1 in G\nWritten by Domenico Gallo\nPerformed by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\nCourtesy of Extreme Production Music\n\n### User reviews747\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Are we there yet?\n\nWas this a missed warning sign? The current climate in America is kind of portayed here. Though some would argue, that it doesn't depict all of America, not even just the one side who seems to have a glutton for punishment and seems to like to vote against their own interests. So while there is some relevance to current events, this go far out.\n\nStill if you feel uneasy watching this, it doesn't mean something is wrong with you. Quite the opposite is the case, everything is right with you. Quite ridiculous at times, it is there for entertainment purposes ... no really! They weren't trying to do a documentary! All kidding aside, this can be viewed as fun - no matter what your political background is.\n\n- kosmasp\n- Jan 28, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ2\n\n- Why did Idiocracy receive such limited theatrical release?\n- How did critics receive the film?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - January 25, 2007 (Germany)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Idiocracia\n- Filming locations\n    - Austin Convention Center - 500 E.

Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But, as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.\n</Quotes>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains coherent and reader-friendly while highlighting the relevant details with XML tags.",

Look Up is a 2021 American political satire black comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by Adam McKay from a story he co-wrote with David Sirota.[1] It stars an ensemble cast featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Mark Rylance, Tyler Perry, Timothée Chalamet, Ron Perlman, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Cate Blanchett, and Meryl Streep. The film tells the story of two astronomers attempting to warn humanity about an approaching comet that will destroy human civilization. The impact event is an allegory for climate change, and the film is a satire of government, political, celebrity, and media indifference to the climate crisis.[6][7]\n\nProduced by McKay's Hyperobject Industries and Bluegrass Films, the film was announced in November 2019. Originally set for a theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, the distribution rights were acquired by Netflix several months later. Lawrence became the first member of the cast to join, with DiCaprio signing on after his discussions with McKay on adjustments to the script; the rest of the cast was added through 2020. Filming was initially set to begin in April 2020 in Massachusetts, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it eventually began in November 2020 and wrapped in February 2021.[8][9]\n\nDon't Look Up began a limited theatrical release on December 10, 2021, before streaming on Netflix on December 24. It was praised for the cast's performances and the musical score, but critics were divided on the merits of McKay's satire; some found it deft, while others criticized it as smug and heavy-handed. Don't Look Up was named one of the top ten films of 2021 by the National Board of Review and American Film Institute. It received four Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), four Golden Globe Award nominations (including Best Picture – Musical or Comedy), six Critics' Choice Award nominations, (including Best Picture), and also won Best Original Screenplay at the 74th Writers Guild of America Awards. The film set a new record for the most viewing hours in a single week on Netflix, and went on to become the second-most-watched movie on Netflix within 28 days of release.\n\n## Plot\n\nKate Dibiasky, a doctoral candidate in astronomy at Michigan State University, discovers an unknown comet. Her professor, Doctor Randall Mindy, confirms that it will collide with Earth in approximately six months and is large enough to cause a global extinction event. NASA verifies the findings, and Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe, head of their Planetary Defense Coordination Office, accompanies Dibiasky and Mindy to present their findings to the White House. However, they are met with apathy from President Janie Orlean and her Chief of Staff Jason Orlean, who is also her son.\n\nOglethorpe encourages Dibiasky and Mindy to leak the news to the media, which they then do, on The Daily Rip, a popular morning talk show. When hosts Jack Bremmer and Brie Evantee treat the topic lightly, Dibiasky loses her temper and angrily rants about the threat before she flees the scene. Mindy receives public approval for his looks, while Dibiasky becomes the subject of negative memes for her on-air behavior. Actual news about the comet's threat receives little public attention, and the danger is denied by Orlean's NASA Director Jocelyn Calder, a top donor to Orlean with no background in astronomy. When news of Orlean's sex scandal with her Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon is exposed, she distracts from the bad publicity by finally confirming the threat and announcing a project to strike and divert the comet using nuclear weapons.\n\nThe mission successfully launches, but Orlean abruptly aborts it when Peter Isherwell, the billionaire CEO of BASH Cellular and another top donor, discovers that the comet contains trillions of dollars worth of rare-earth elements. The White House agrees to commercially exploit the comet by fragmenting and recovering it from the ocean, using technology proposed by BASH in a scheme that has not undergone peer review. Orlean sidelines Dibiasky and Oglethorpe while hiring Mindy as the National Science Advisor. Dibiasky attempts to mobilize public opposition to the scheme but gives up under threat from Orlean's administration. Mindy becomes a prominent voice advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities and begins an affair with Evantee.\n\nWorld opinion is divided among people who believe the comet is a severe threat, those who decry alarmism and believe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and those who deny that the comet even exists. When Dibiasky returns home to Illinois, her parents kick her out of the house and she begins a relationship with a young man named Yule, a shoplifter she meets at her retail job. After Mindy's wife confronts him about his infidelity, she returns to Michigan without him. Mindy questions whether Isherwell's technology will be able to break apart the comet, angering the billionaire. Becoming frustrated with the administration, Mindy finally breaks down and rants on national television, criticizing Orlean for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questioning humanity's indifference.\n\nCut off from the administration, Mindy reconciles with Dibiasky as the comet becomes visible from Earth. Mindy, Dibiasky, and Oglethorpe organize a protest campaign on social media, telling people to \"Just Look Up\" and call on other countries to conduct comet interception operations. Simultaneously, Orlean starts an anti-campaign telling people \"Don't Look Up\". Orlean and BASH cut Russia, India, and China out of the rights for the comet-mining deal, so they prepare their own joint deflection mission, only for their spacecraft to explode. As the comet becomes larger in the sky, Orlean's supporters start turning on her administration. BASH's attempt at breaking the comet apart goes awry and everyone realizes that humanity is doomed.\n\nIsherwell, Orlean, and others in their elite circle board a sleeper spaceship designed to find an Earth-like planet, inadvertently leaving Jason behind. Orlean offers Mindy two places on the ship, but he declines, choosing to spend a final evening with his friends and family. As expected, the comet strikes off the coast of Chile, causing a worldwide disaster and triggering an extinction-level event. In a mid-credits scene, the 2,000 people who left Earth before the comet's impact land on a lush alien planet 22,740 years later, ending their period of suspended animation. They exit their spacecraft naked and admire the habitable world. However, Orlean is suddenly killed by a bird-like predator (a death predicted by BASH's algorithms), one of a pack that surrounds the planetary newcomers. In a post-credits scene back on Earth, it is revealed that Jason managed to survive the impact.

Lawrence became the first member of the cast to join, with DiCaprio signing on after his discussions with McKay on adjustments to the script; the rest of the cast was added through 2020.\n\nThis movie came from my burgeoning terror about the climate crisis and the fact that we live in a society that tends to place it as the fourth or fifth news story, or in some cases even deny that it's happening, and how horrifying that is, but at the same time preposterously funny.[12]\n\nAfter Vice was released, David Sirota asked Adam McKay to use his \"superpowers of humor and writing\" to create a climate change movie that would be different from the Mad Max-type post-apocalyptic films that had previously been released.[13] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, McKay described how he and Sirota came up with the premise of Don't Look Up while discussing the existential threat of climate change and their frustration over the lack of media coverage it was receiving:\n\nI started talking to a lot of [climate] scientists. I kept looking for good news, and I never got it. Everything I was hearing was worse than what I was hearing on the mainstream media. So I was talking to [David Sirota], and we were both just like, \"can you believe that this isn't being covered in the media? That it's being pushed to the end of the story? That there's no headlines?\" And Sirota just offhandedly said, \"it's like a comet is heading to Earth and it's going to destroy us all and no one cares.\" And I was like, \"that's the idea!\"[14]\n\nMcKay has described the film as a \"blend of broad comedy\" with elements of disaster films and horror films.[15]\n\nAstronomer Amy Mainzer, principal investigator of NASA's NEOWISE mission that tracks near-Earth objects, served as an \"astrotech adviser\" for the film. She provided scientific advice and supported with writing scenes from an early stage of production.[16][17]\n\nOn November 8, 2019, it was announced that Paramount Pictures would distribute the film, with Adam McKay writing, directing, and producing under his Hyperobject Industries banner.[18] On February 19, 2020, Netflix acquired the film from Paramount and Jennifer Lawrence was cast in the film.[19] On May 12, 2020, it was announced that Cate Blanchett had joined the film.[20] In September 2020, Rob Morgan joined the cast.[21] In October 2020, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Himesh Patel, Timothée Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi (Scott Mescudi), and Tomer Sisley were added.[22][23] McKay wrote the part of Dibiasky specifically for Lawrence, and spent four to five months going over ideas with DiCaprio, tweaking the script before the actor ultimately signed on.[24] In November 2020, Tyler Perry, Melanie Lynskey, and Ron Perlman joined the cast.[25] Mark Rylance and Michael Chiklis were revealed as part of the cast in February 2021.[26] Paul Guilfoyle was announced in May.[27] Matthew Perry was also cast and had scenes filmed with Hill that were ultimately cut from the final film due to health issues.[28] Gina Gershon also filmed a scene with DiCaprio and Blanchett that was cut from the film.[29] Leonardo DiCaprio received top billing on the film's posters and the trailers while Jennifer Lawrence was accorded top billing at the beginning of the film itself. This was also the case with earlier productions The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with James Stewart and John Wayne and All the President's Men (1976) with Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nPrincipal photography was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[30] Filming commenced on November 18, 2020, at various locations in Boston, Massachusetts.[31] Part of the film takes place in New York City with Boston standing in as New York. Filming also took place in other Massachusetts cities including Brockton, Framingham, and Westborough.[a][32][33] On February 5, 2021, Jennifer Lawrence was mildly injured during filming when a controlled glass explosion went awry.[34] Filming wrapped on February 18, 2021.[35]\n\n### Lawsuit\n\nOn December 6, 2023, Adam McKay, along with Netflix, was sued for copyright infringement over Don't Look Up. William Collier, an author from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, claimed that he is the original writer of the story, set in Baton Rouge, called \"Stanley's Comet\", which he self-published in 2012. Collier's daughter worked for Jimmer Miller Entertainment, part of McKay's management team until 2015. Collier alleges that his daughter submitted the text to Mosaic Media Group and it was then received by McKay's manager. \"Since Stanley’s Comet was received by McKay’s manager, custom and practice in the entertainment industry dictates that this constitutes receipt by McKay,\" writes Steven Lowe, a lawyer for Collier, in the suit. \"Furthermore, upon information and belief, the Novel was transmitted via courier, email or hand-delivery (or via other means) to McKay himself.\"[36]\n\n\"The movie, like the novel, makes a strong political critique of the media, the government, and the cultural elite by showcasing their shallowness and reliance on popular opinion polls and social media algorithms,\" writes USC professor of comparative literature David Roman. \"McKay’s film is also full of satire and humor and — like Stanley’s Comet — moves toward the absurd. In each case, the irony drives the humor and the social critique and does so in the same style and method.\"[36]\n\n### Music\n\nTo promote the film, on December 3, 2021, Ariana Grande and Kid Cudi released the single \"Just Look Up\", which is also performed in the film.[37] The original score for the film is composed by Nicholas Britell, who previously scored McKay's The Big Short (2015), Vice (2018) and the HBO television series Succession (2019–2022); McKay served as an executive producer of the latter. He used a wide range of instrumentation that reflect varied music styles and genres.[38][39] He did this so as to give a remainder on the existential crisis on the planet following a catastrophic event as well as the absurdity of how people react to it.[40] Apart from \"Just Look Up\", the film also featured \"Second Nature\" by Bon Iver, which was released along with Britell's score album on December 10, by Republic Records, and \"Doorman\" by Slowthai.[41]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office and VoD\n\nOn February 19, 2020, it was announced that Netflix planned to release the film in 2020.[19] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, filming and release of the film were delayed.[42] The film premiered in New York City on December 5, 2021.[43] It received a limited theatrical release on December 10, and began streaming on Netflix on December 24.[44][45] The film made an estimated $260,000 from 500 theaters on its first day, and a total of $700,000 in its opening weekend.[46]\n\nDon't Look Up was the most-streamed English-language film on Netflix during its first week of release with a viewership of 111.03 million hours,[47] the second highest viewership for a movie during its debut weekend on Netflix.[48] It was the second most-streamed-film of the week in the United States according to TV Time.[49] Per Nielsen, the film had a viewership of 1.6 billion minutes in the United States.[50] In the second week, it retained its first position with a viewership of 152.29 million hours,[51] which also set the record for highest weekly viewership for any film ever on Netflix.[52][53]\n\nFor its first 28 days, the film culminated a viewership of 359.8 million hours, making it the second most-watched film within 28 days of release on Netflix during this period of time.[54] By March 20, the film had been streamed in 10.3 million households in the United States according to Samba TV, including 641,000 since the Oscar nomination announcements on February 8.[55]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 55% of 305 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Don't Look Up aims too high for its scattershot barbs to consistently land, but Adam McKay's star-studded satire hits its target of collective denial square on.\"[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 49 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[57]\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle praised the film, \"Don't Look Up might be the funniest movie of 2021. It's the most depressing too, and that odd combination makes for a one-of-a-kind experience. ... McKay gives you over two hours of laughs while convincing you that the world is coming to an end.\"[58] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said: \"From Streep and DiCaprio and Lawrence through the supporting players, Don't Look Up is filled with greatly talented actors really and truly selling this material—but the volume remains at 11 throughout the story when some changes in tone here and there might have more effectively carried the day.\"[59] In the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang wrote, \"Nothing about the foolishness and outrageousness of what the movie shows us—no matter how virtuosically sliced and diced by McKay's characteristically jittery editor, Hank Corwin—can really compete with the horrors of our real-world American idiocracy.\"[60] Amit Katwala of Wired concluded that \"Don't Look Up nails the frustration of being a scientist.\"[61] Linda Marric of The Jewish Chronicle gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: \"There is something genuinely endearing about a film that doesn't seem to care one bit about coming across as silly as long as its message is heard\".[62]\n\nIn a negative review, David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"A cynical, insufferably smug satire stuffed to the gills with stars that purports to comment on political and media inattention to the climate crisis but really just trivializes it. Dr. Strangelove it ain't.\"[63] Peter Debruge of Variety called it a \"smug, easy-target political satire\" and wrote, \"Don't Look Up plays like the leftie answer to Armageddon—which is to say, it ditches the Bruckheimer approach of assembling a bunch of blue-collar heroes to rocket out to space and nuke the approaching comet, opting instead to spotlight the apathy, incompetence and financial self-interest of all involved.\"[64] In The Guardian, Charles Bramesco wrote that the \"script states the obvious as if everyone else is too stupid to realize it and does so from a position of lofty superiority that would drive away any partisans who still need to be won over.\"[65] In The Sociological Review, Katherine Cross accused the film of \"smug condescension\" and wrote it \"is designed to flatter a certain type of liberal viewer into feeling like they're the last sane person in the world, surrounded by morons.\"[66]\n\nReviews from right-wing publications were nearly unanimously negative. Madeline Fry Schultz of the American conservative publication Washington Examiner wrote \"McKay manages to deliver nothing more than a derivative and meandering 'satire' of capitalism, Donald Trump, and climate deniers that will be forgotten in less than six months.\"[67] Kyle Smith of the National Review wrote it \"expends 140 brain-injuriously unfunny minutes... propelling low-velocity spitballs at social media, Washington, tech moguls, Trumpism, and (this detail feels thrown in last minute) anti-vaxxers.\"[68]\n\nNathan J. Robinson, editor of American progressive publication Current Affairs, believes that \"critics were not only missing the point of the film in important ways, but that the very way they discussed the film exemplified the problem that the film was trying to draw attention to. Some of the responses to the movie could have appeared in the movie itself.\"[69] Slavoj Žižek, writing in Compact, said \"critics were displeased by the light tone of Don't Look Up!, claiming it trivializes the ultimate apocalypse. What really bothered these critics is the exact opposite: The film highlights trivialization that permeates not only the establishment, but even the protesters.\"[70] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett viewed the film as astute and was caustic about the critical reviews.[71] Journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot wrote that \"no wonder journalists have slated it ... it's about them\" and added that for environmental activists like himself, the film, while fast‑paced and humorous, \"seemed all too real\".[72] Author and activist Naomi Klein mentions it in her 2023 book Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World by saying that \"Kate's plight perfectly mirrors the bizarre contradictions of our high-stakes moment in planetary history: we are all trapped inside economic and social structures that encourage us to obsessively perfect our miniscule selves even as we know, if only on a subconscious level, that we are in the very last years when it might still be possible to avert an existential planetary crisis.\"[73]\n\nBong Joon-ho, director of Parasite, included Don't Look Up as one of his favorites of 2021.[74]\n\n### Reception amongst scientists\n\nSince the film's release, numerous climate scientists and climate communicators have offered positive opinions on the film.[75][76][77]\n\nIn an opinion piece published in The Guardian, climate scientist Peter Kalmus remarked, \"Don't Look Up is satire. But speaking as a climate scientist doing everything I can to wake people up and avoid planetary destruction, it's also the most accurate film about society's terrifying non-response to climate breakdown I've seen.\"[78] Climate scientist Michael E. Mann also expressed support for the film, calling it \"serious sociopolitical commentary posing as comedy\".[79] In an article for Scientific American, Rebecca Oppenheimer questioned the film's use of a comet impact as an effective metaphor for climate change, given the large differences in timescale of these differing potential extinction crisis events and the nature of their impacts, but praised its depiction of science denialism and depiction of a botched attempt to address a \"planet-killer\" comet.[16] Climate policy expert Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and McKay wrote a joint op-ed in The Guardian advocating for the value of humour in promoting action on climate change, in contrast with other media coverage.[80]\n\nWriting in Physics World, Laura Hiscott said that this \"genuinely funny and entertaining film\" would appeal to scientists, who would appreciate the \"nods to academia such as the importance of peer review, the 'publish or perish' problem and the issue of senior academics getting the credit for their PhD students' discoveries\".[81]\n\nOne of the scenes in the film was compared on social media to a situation in Brazil. In that situation, microbiologist and science communicator Natália Pasternak Taschner criticized a news report made by TV Cultura on a live broadcast in December 2020. They told the Brazilian population to face the COVID-19 pandemic with \"lightness\", minimizing the risks. They also put pressure on the public to be content and uncritical of the Jair Bolsonaro administration's lack of effective response to the pandemic.[82] Hearing about the comparisons, Pasternak thanked McKay, DiCaprio and Lawrence on Twitter, with the video subtitled in English, for the \"incredible\" film.[83]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                               | Date

communication is at the forefront of the film, as it revolves around Mindy and Dibiasky, two scientists, struggling to share the news of their discovery with politicians, talk show hosts, and civilians who are ignorant about the scientific facts of humanity's impending destruction by Comet Dibiasky. Many academic scholars of media and communication have written commentaries that analyze and critique the portrayal of science communication in the film.[citation needed]\n\n### U.S. centrism\n\nIn the Journal of Science Communication, Niels G. Mede writes \"the film depicts sharp partisan divides, strong affective polarization, high distrust toward science within certain social milieus, and pronounced news media sensationalism, which have been found to be characteristic of the United States but not, or to a lesser extent, of several countries other than the US.\"[143] From the same journal, writer Julie Doyle remarked that, \"yet, as the film critiques existing structures and systems it does not imagine an alternative set of realities, nor explain the comet's cause. In focusing upon the fictional stories of scientists, politicians, and media celebrities, the film fails to center any marginalized voices, continuing to privilege global north perspectives, even as these are satirised.\"[144] Doyle comments that \"climate communication needs to keep in place both climate mitigation and adaptation, making the historical and structural inequalities of capitalism and colonialism the interconnected stories of both.\"[144]\n\n### Media training for scientists\n\nOne solution to Mindy and Dibiasky's failed attempts to communicate the severity of the impending comet is undergoing media training, which was brought up in the film multiple times, such as at the conference room at the New York Herald where the Chief Editor proposes media training to Mindy before the show. The concept of media training can come in different forms. Samer Angelone, in a commentary journal on science communication, writes, \"The style that scientists use to communicate science to peer scientists is mostly objective, complex, and full of technical jargon, which is difficult for the general public to connect to—even if it is in the same language.\"[145] Another way to mitigate science skepticism is through storytelling. Mede writes, \"The film also illustrates that storytelling can be a promising strategy to mitigate these reservations ... showing how Mindy is advised before a TV interview that he is 'just telling a story' and must 'keep it simple.'\"[143]\n\n### Gendered emotions in scientific communication\n\nGendered discourse on emotions and mental health make its way into the film through the portrayal of the public's reaction to Mindy and Dibiasky's various media appearances. The scientists share their discovery on a morning talk show, The Daily Rip, in which Dibiasky has an emotional outburst over the show hosts' persistent attempts to sugarcoat the devastating news of the doomsday comet. Professor of media and communication Julie Doyle writes, \"Gendered norms affect Mindy and Dibiasky's public credibility and the mitigatory comet actions they promote. Following his own emotional outburst on TV, Mindy is subsequently recuperated through processes of celebritisation ... hailed as a 'sexy' scientist offering rational and calm advice to the viewers; becoming chief science advisor to the White House to monitor the drone activities of tech billionaire Peter Isherwell; and embarking on a sexual affair with Evantee. In contrast, Dibiasky is discredited and side-lined from rational public commentary through (climate) memes.\"[144]\n\n### Easter eggs\n\nThroughout the film, many historic figures from science and politics can be spotted, adding to the film's nuanced discussion about the relationship between science and politics.\n\nThe opening scene of the film features a figure of Carl Sagan on Dibiasky's desk. In a journal commentary for Science Communication, Samer Angelone writes that \"Sagan was an astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, and astrobiologist but, above all, he was an upholder of scientific credibility and communication.\"[145] Sagan advocated for the urgency to battle climate change, and many viewers see the film as an allegory for him, but his image is juxtaposed by a painting of George W. Bush, \"who later tried to downplay this urgency.\"[143] The film also \"references the affinity of anti-science resentment and populism, showing how President Orlean and her team slander Mindy and Dibiasky using populist rhetoric ... and gather in an Oval Office that has a portrait of the anti-establishment science skeptic Andrew Jackson.\"[143]\n\nThe film ends with a scene that reflects the Last Supper. Dr. Mindy, his family, Kate, Yule, and Teddy all sit around a dinner table and engage in a hand-held prayer, spoken by Yule. After the prayer, Kate Dibiasky gives Yule a kiss, and moments later Comet Dibiasky destroys Earth.[146]\n\n## See also\n\n- Double Asteroid Redirection Test – a real NASA mission to test deflection of an asteroid in 2022\n- Climate change in popular culture\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Additional filming locations include Canton, Chicopee, Fall River, Norton, Salisbury, Weymouth, and Worcester.\n- ^ a b c d Nominees: Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, Nicholas Britell, and Taura Stinson\n- ^ Nominees: Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ariana Grande, Jonah Hill, Jennifer Lawrence, Melanie Lynskey, Kid Cudi, Rob Morgan, Himesh Patel, Ron Perlman, Tyler Perry, Mark Rylance, and Meryl Streep\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"Don't Look Up\".

The film tells the story of two astronomers attempting to warn humanity about an approaching comet that will destroy human civilization. The impact event is an allegory for <Themes>climate change</Themes>, and the film is a satire of government, political, celebrity, and media indifference to the climate crisis.\n\nProduced by McKay's <AdditionalInformation>Hyperobject Industries</AdditionalInformation> and <AdditionalInformation>Bluegrass Films</AdditionalInformation>, the film was announced in November 2019. Originally set for a theatrical release by <AdditionalInformation>Paramount Pictures</AdditionalInformation>, the distribution rights were acquired by <AdditionalInformation>Netflix</AdditionalInformation> several months later.

It was praised for the cast's performances and the musical score, but critics were divided on the merits of McKay's satire; some found it deft, while others criticized it as smug and heavy-handed. Don't Look Up was named one of the top ten films of 2021 by the <AdditionalInformation>National Board of Review</AdditionalInformation> and <AdditionalInformation>American Film Institute</AdditionalInformation>. It received four Academy Award nominations (including <AdditionalInformation>Best Picture</AdditionalInformation>), four Golden Globe Award nominations (including <AdditionalInformation>Best Picture – Musical or Comedy</AdditionalInformation>), six Critics' Choice Award nominations (including <AdditionalInformation>Best Picture</AdditionalInformation>), and also won <AdditionalInformation>Best Original Screenplay</AdditionalInformation> at the 74th Writers Guild of America Awards.

Combining elements of political satire with dark humor, the film stars Joel Murray and Tara Lynne Barr as a middle-aged man and a teenage girl who go on a killing spree after bonding over their disgust of what American culture has become in a post-9/11 world.\n\n## Plot\n\nFrank Murdoch is a middle-aged insurance salesman who is sick of how America has fallen into a state of depravity based on pop culture, TV, the Internet, and talk radio. He fantasizes about killing his neighbors, whose screaming baby worsens his migraines and keeps him awake all night. The following day, the neighbor blocks his old car with their sports car, and he is frustrated when they act like he is imposing by asking them to move it. Meanwhile, Frank's ex-wife Alison has custody of their daughter Ava, who has become a spoiled brat. Frank is fired when he obtains a co-worker's address without permission to send her roses after she tells him she is feeling down. His uninterested doctor later tells him that he has a terminal brain tumor.\n\nThat evening, Frank watches television, and his attention is caught by American Superstarz, a talent show featuring an intellectually disabled man named Steven Clark, who the judges mock for his attempts at singing. Frank prepares to shoot himself but stops when he sees a reality show about Chloe, an extremely spoiled teenager, which gives him an epiphany. He steals his neighbor's car and drives to Chloe's school; after unsuccessfully attempting to blow her up in her car, he simply shoots her through the window. Fellow student Roxanne \"Roxy\" Harmon witnesses this and applauds Frank despite initially chastising him because she thought he was a pervert spying on Chloe. Roxy follows Frank back to his motel, where he is once again preparing to shoot himself, and he agrees to let her watch him do so; instead, she decides to talk him out of it. Frank explains that he only wants terrible people to die, and Roxy suggests they kill Chloe's parents, who only mourn the financial loss their daughter's death has brought them.\n\nThe two travel to Chloe's home, where Frank shoots Chloe's father, and Roxy stabs Chloe's mother. Roxy convinces Frank to let her join his killing spree by revealing that she is trailer trash who is at the mercy of a drug-addicted mother and rapist stepfather. They watch a documentary about the Mỹ Lai Massacre in a cinema, where several teenagers begin acting obnoxiously. Frank and Roxy shoot all of them except for the one who did not do anything disruptive, and Frank thanks her for it after killing a man who is recording his actions on a cell phone. Frank and Roxy kill several more people, such as a rude man who double-parks his car, a group of far-right religious protesters, and a popular right-wing political commentator. Frank spares the life of his ex-wife's new fiancé, telling Roxy that death would be an easier fate than leaving the man alive to suffer with Frank's ex-wife and selfish daughter. Roxy suggests to Frank that they move to France and \"go legit\" with a plan to raise goats and make cheese while avoiding prosecution for the murders they have committed, as France would not extradite them.\n\nFrank's doctor calls him and reveals that he has no tumor, as his MRI results were mixed up with that of a similarly named patient who does. While eating breakfast at a motel with Roxy, Frank's new lease on life is ruined when a man at the following table assumes that Roxy is an underage prostitute and that Frank is her pimp. Later, Frank sees a missing person report on the news in which Roxy's parents are revealed to be wholesome, middle-class, and concerned about her safety. Enraged at Roxy for lying to him, Frank takes out his anger on the man who wanted to hire Roxy for sex by strangling him to death. Frank tells Roxy that he knows the truth, and she confesses but explains that she wants to escape a life of bland conformity. Frank gives her the keys to his neighbor's car and leaves in the pickup truck of the man he just killed.\n\nFrank buys an assault rifle from an arms dealer and sees another TV news report revealing that Roxy is back home with her parents and that police are searching for her apparent abductor. He gains access to the American Superstarz studio, kills several audience members and a judge, and holds everybody else in the studio hostage. As the police arrive, Roxy joins Frank onstage and apologizes for lying to him. Frank gives a speech in front of the TV camera about the negative behavior promoted in today's American society and mentions that he heard about the suicide attempt by Steven, the disabled singing man who is now in the studio as a guest performer; Steven reveals that he did not attempt suicide because they mocked him, but rather because they had no plans to put him back on TV. Frank turns to Roxy and tells her that she is pretty—a question he had refused to answer earlier due to her young age—and the two shoot Steven, the judges, and various audience members before being gunned down by the police.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Joel Murray as Frank Murdoch\n- Tara Lynne Barr as Roxanne \"Roxy\" Harmon\n- Mackenzie Brooke Smith as Ava\n- Melinda Page Hamilton as Alison\n- Rich McDonald as Brad\n- Regan Burns as Michael Fuller\n- Aris Alvarado as Steven Clark\n- Maddie Hasson as Chloe\n- Geoff Pierson as Frank's boss\n- Larry Miller as Chloe's father\n- Dorie Barton as Chloe's mother\n- David Mendenhall as Mr. Harmon\n- Andrea Harper as Mrs. Harmon\n- Travis Wester as Ed\n- Mike Tristano as Mike\n- Sandra Vergara as Mercedes Paar\n- Toby Huss as theater patron with cell phone\n- Mo Gaffney as lounge singer\n- Kirk Bovill as police captain\n- Romeo Brown as John Tyler\n- Michael Carbonaro as Robbie Barkley\n- Bryce Johnson as co-worker\n- Tom Kenny and Jill Talley as office staff\n- Jack Plotnick and Tom Lenk as party planners\n- Steve Agee as American Superstarz crew member\n\n## Festivals\n\nGod Bless America was selected to screen at the Toronto International Film Festival, South By Southwest Film Festival,[3] as well as the Maryland Film Festival and the Brisbane International Film Festival.\n\n## Release\n\nJoel Murray, Tara Lynne Barr, and Bobcat Goldthwait promoting the film at the 2012 Deauville American Film Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGod Bless America premiered on September 9, 2011, at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival,[4] and was released video on demand on April 6, 2012, and in theatres on May 11, 2012.[5] The DVD and Blu-ray for the film were released on July 3, 2012.[6][7]\n\n### Critical response\n\nAs of June 2020,[update] the film holds a 65% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 114 reviews, and the average rating is 6.17/10.

Maybe we share the same comfortable and privileged background, where all our fundamental needs are satisfied at all times. Despite this, you might also share with me a latent feeling of inadequacy, alienation, dissatisfaction, or guilt. These feelings could be sensed through a certain kind of music and movies already in the early 90ies, before we could fully understand them through our own experience. In my opinion, the filmmaker that best managed to encapsulate them in his work is Gregg Araki, one of the most underrated true auteurs of the last 30 years. Araki started making movies in the late 80ies, reached peak underground popularity around 2004 with Mysterious Skin (which features some of the most disturbing male rape and child abuse scenes in the history of cinema as far as I’ve seen) and released a few more movies before switching to TV series for good in 2016. An absolute gender bender, Araki explored a wide range of movie genres to show life from the point of view of queer, gender-fluid teens in search of their identity. The themes of alienation and inadequacy run like a thread through his whole work, but his 1995 movie The Doom Generation offers us the most interesting case in point.\n\nNot only because of the “nihilistic, immoral” feel to it that scandalized most of the press; not only because of the somber atmospheres conjured up by the soundtrack (put together by 4AD label co-owner Ivo Watts-Russell among others, and featuring Nine Inch Nails, Front 242, Coil, Love &amp; Rockets, Slowdive, Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Aphex Twin, Skinny Puppy and Medicine to name a few); not only because of the protagonists being three sexy young actors destined for the Olympus of 90ies countercultural teen idols (Rose Mc Gowan, James Duval and Johnathon Schaech), but because it speaks of us on many different levels.\n\nI’m not alone in holding this opinion: despite it being badly received by the mainstream press at the time, during the twenty-five years since its release the movie became the subject of ecstatic reviews, interviews and books describing it as an “iconic and subversive portrait” of futility and alienation that marries Araki’s “Godardian cinematic style with industrial music”, a “road movie for the AIDS generation” that “captures the cultural apathy of the present”. Film scholars and critics alike seem to recognize the ability of the film to offer a sharp and poetic glimpse into our generation’s characteristic brand of “existential struggles”. In one sentence:\n\nWe are “The Doom Generation”\n\nFirst of all, we share a collective unanswered question, among other things: are we or aren’t we The Doom Generation? Those who grew up “knowing they will see the end of the world”, as Jordan (James Duval), one of the protagonists of The Doom Generation, asks at one point in the movie? There’s definitely some truth behind this seemingly melodramatic question. Nowadays many would at least agree that the future doesn’t look especially promising for a variety of obvious reasons (climate change, the newfound vigor of populism, racism and homophobia, the crisis of democracy, and so on). Even before the latest developments, we had realized that things weren’t quite going the way we had expected, or maybe they were going exactly the way we had feared they would. The world turned out to be much more complex than we thought, and it’s not going to get any easier.\n\nWe should have known that, but we were not prepared. When The Doom Generation (and other “anti-coming of age” movies filled with existential dread) came out, schools, parents, and the media – especially TV, of course – were still busy telling teenagers and kids of the wealthy western world that they could be “everything they wanted to be when they grew up” – as long as they studied hard in school, never broke written and unwritten rules, and bought the right products. The oldest among us entered adult life when the elaborate system of deception built by capitalism to promote itself as the only viable option started to manifest its faults even among the members of the most comfortable social classes – and it became clear that the path laid down for us was paved with wrong assumptions, wild guesses and wishful thinking.\n\nI’m not here to point fingers, but rather to understand and move on. We can’t really blame our parents and teachers for telling us that by doing well in school we would “make it” in life. At the time it was true – but now education no longer makes a difference on its own. Resilience, hard work and discipline in particular make a great deal of difference, but we haven’t got plenty of that stuff. When it comes to our parents, I’m always inclined to think that they did their best and they gave us everything they could, but it was probably way too much. They worked hard, but in most cases we never had to.\n\nAn inevitable culprit is TV; when we grew up, kids used to watch it a lot more than would nowadays be considered healthy. I recently rewatched a lot of movies from the 90ies and noticed how heavily and frequently TV was embedded in them, often to be mocked or revealed as a corrupting tool of mass control: Natural Born Killers, Reality Bites and even Twin Peaks are some of the most explicit examples. We could definitely say worse things about the internet now, but in the late 90ies it was still a wonderful place filled with well-meaning nerds, and very few could foresee its future impact on society (to quote David Bowie in 1999: “I think we’re actually on the cusp of something both exhilarating and terrifying”).\n\nIf you ask me, I won’t hesitate for one second in putting religion to the stand as well. Not only because of all the usual misdeeds of Christianity, including its role in securing and sealing the triumph of capitalism, but also because it induced us to take full accountability for things we’re not even responsible for – and especially because it encouraged us to dwell in our sense of guilt instead of teaching us to love ourselves the way we are, in order to be able to love our fellow man.\n\nAs our living conditions improved, we kept expanding our definition of “successful”, but we never worked on revising it as a whole. What does it mean to be “successful” anyway? Does it mean making as much money as possible – or at least being able to support ourselves – while also successfully “doing what you love” for a living, honoring the time spent getting an expensive education, setting up a family and ultimately being happy, happy, happy?\n\n“Are you happy”, to quote Hord of Occvlta? Me neither. I feel more like Sisyphus; Camus said that “one must imagine Sisyphus happy” as he drags his humongous stone up that mountain every day for eternity, so what’s the big deal one could say? We might have never been burdened with a magnitude of weight comparable to Sisyphus’ boulder in our lives, but we are juggling way too many small exasperating “stones” of responsibility to be able to feel that “the struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart”. We can’t start going anywhere if we don’t let some of those stones drop to the ground first.\n\nPerhaps it’s not so surprising that we took refuge in the escapism of drug-infused bliss, self-obsession or social media, or that we started wearing our passions and talents like blinders to avoid looking at the grim landscape of our present and future. The “cultural apathy of the present” works as a comfortable shelter from the state of alienation we still find ourselves in today. That’s why The Doom Generation is one of those movies that still speak to us: it’s a road trip to nowhere, anywhere, as long as it’s far away from the inadequacy and guilt eating us up since we started being conscious of our own situation.\n\nApathy For The Devil\n\nThe film opens inside a club in L.A., where a bored Amy (Rose McGowan) is trying to light her cigarette but can’t find her “skull lighter”. She proceeds to rebuff a man twice her size that approaches her asking for drugs, by offering him a couple of eloquent expressions from her vast array of multifaceted, long-forgotten 90ies slang terms (one of my favorites: “Mellowize thyself, fishwich!”).\n\nEveryone in the club is dancing to Heresy by Nine Inch Nails: “God is Dead/ And no one cares/ If there is a hell/ I’ll see you there”. The song is followed by a remix of Religion from EBM kings Front 242, a wonderfully apocalyptic cyberpunk track from their 1993 album 06:21:03:11 Up Evil that goes: “You see, the sin is in me/ When will it stop unfolding/ When will I ever be face to face/ With the devil in me?”.\n\nThe soundtrack seems to have been carefully selected to work as an ominous, profetic guide to the movie, because “the devil” is precisely what Amy and her boyfriend Jordan (James Duval) end up facing after leaving the club and trying to have sex in a parking lot. Their attempt to lose their virginity fails because Jordan is afraid of catching AIDS; shortly after, a complete stranger named Xavier is pushed over their windshield by some very angry dudes who are attacking him, so he enters the car and urges Amy to hit the gas.\n\nXavier (Johnathon Schaech) soon becomes their guide through an indolent journey of self-discovery, as the three embark on a directionless trip to escape their enemies and their fate, which is invariably up against their (lack of) will. If anything can go wrong for them it does, and Xavier is the only one among them who seems well-equipped enough to address the challenges they face as they continue to bump across omnipresent flocks of grotesque, aggressive strangers who despise them and want to kill them for one reason or another.\n\nAs Kylo-Patrick R. Hart pointed out in his 2010 book on Gregg Araki titled Images For A Generation Doomed, the violence is often way too campy and funny to be the point of the movie. What’s often overlooked, however, is that love is never diminished or caricatured: it’s always dreamy, wholehearted, eager and real. There’s always shoegaze music in the air when Amy and Jordan have sex; he loves her unconditionally and she calls him “the bright red cherry on top of my sundae”, the only endearing metaphor in her lexicon filled with colorful insults thrown at everyone else she meets. Araki’s press kit described the bond that forms between Jordan, Amy and Xavier as “a triangle of love, sex and desperation too pure for this world” (courtesy of film critic Roger Ebert, who mocked this and other passages from the press kit in his resentful review of the movie, to which he gave zero stars).\n\nBoth Jordan and Amy feel attracted to Xavier from the beginning; they gravitate towards his unrestrained sexual drive and benefit from his quick and sharp survival skills despite their initial reservations. Why is only Xavier able to react and available to take responsibility for his actions? Maybe because he is one hundred percent guilt-free. “Guilt is for old married couples”, he tells Amy after the two had sex for the first time, and “life is but a dream”, he sings while taking a bath.\n\nAmy’s conclusion is that he must be the Devil: but the Devil belongs to the same system of values as God does, as most of us “Lucifer’s friends” realized by now. By building a philosophy on embracing the opposite of the prescriptions listed in the Bible, the Church of Satan didn’t manage to prove Christianity obsolete. To pay any attention to LaVey, one must have had some interest in what our self-styled representatives of God on Earth had to say in the first place. I treasured my copy of The Satanic Bible when I discovered it at sixteen after “escaping” a strict religious upbringing, but I lost track of it many years ago: that “phase” was necessary for me, until at some point it wasn’t anymore. I think we can’t really break away from any system of values only by belligerently invoking the opposite of what it prescribes, because we’d still be measuring ourselves against it.\n\nThat’s something even Charles Manson, the guiltless villain we most often equate with the Devil, warned us against. First Dark Ride, a song by Coil included in The Doom Generation soundtrack, features a sample from Manson’s 1988 interview with Geraldo Rivera in Quentin State Prison, where he famously said:\n\n“OK, I’ll play, there’s no game I can’t play… I’ll be the Devil. Your courtrooms have convicted me for being Jesus Christ in one courtroom, and then in the other courtroom you convicted me for being the Devil… Do you need someone like that in your world? That’s your judgement now; the judgement you make on this mirror man you gotta carry… I am God and I’ve killed everyone, now what? It does not improve your issue any. …\n…What you are doing is you’re creating a legend, you are creating a beast, you are creating whatever you judge yourselves with into the word Manson, and that’s not me at all, man!…”\n\nThe 99 Problems of the 99 Percent are One\n\nIn the last century, slowly but surely, we managed to “kill God” under many respects, but we haven’t really opened our hearts to a valid alternative source of enlightenment yet. Those who are successful think they don’t need it; those who aren’t rarely look any further than the particular issue they have at heart. One can only be either with us or against us on any issue – veganism, climate activism, feminism, you name it. We are harsh judges of ourselves and others, and our radicalist sectarian approach to the dismantling of outdated values prevents us from seeing that our different problems, traumas and wishes are connected in many ways. This works in favor of our common enemy: we’re still playing by its individualist rules.\n\nSpoiler alert: in The Doom Generation, our favorite “band of outsiders” are, unsurprisingly, headed for a violent epilogue. Amy, Jordan and Xavier are tracked down by a bunch of homophobic Nazis to the abandoned warehouse where they are hiding and engaging in their first passionate, liberating act of collective sex. The Nazis quite literally “put our their fire” right before Jordan and Xavier can continue enjoying their intimacy without Amy, and proceed to brutally torture and rape them in the goriest ways imaginable. Jordan, a sweet and dreamy creature filled with wonder and love, but also loaded with fears and self-doubt, pays the highest price; or does he? In any case, they were doomed; their trip ended before their journey towards boundless, universal love was complete, but the same doesn’t have to happen to us.\n\n- Generation Y, Gregg Araki, Soundtrack\n\n- By\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValeria Calderoni\n- June 2, 2020\n- Articles, Movies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Valeria Calderoni\n\n#### Newsletter\n\n#### © 2025 Lärm &amp; Gestalt\n\n#### Imprint | Privacy Policy\n\n### Contact us",

I think we can’t really break away from any system of values only by belligerently invoking the opposite of what it prescribes, because we’d still be measuring ourselves against it.\n        \n        That’s something even <AdditionalInformation>Charles Manson</AdditionalInformation>, the guiltless villain we most often equate with the Devil, warned us against. First <AdditionalInformation>Dark Ride</AdditionalInformation>, a song by <AdditionalInformation>Coil</AdditionalInformation> included in <Name>The Doom Generation</Name> soundtrack, features a sample from <AdditionalInformation>Manson</AdditionalInformation>’s 1988 interview with <AdditionalInformation>Geraldo Rivera</AdditionalInformation> in <AdditionalInformation>Quentin State Prison</AdditionalInformation>, where he famously said:\n        \n        “OK, I’ll play, there’s no game I can’t play… I’ll be the Devil. Your courtrooms have convicted me for being Jesus Christ in one courtroom, and then in the other courtroom you convicted me for being the Devil… Do you need someone like that in your world? That’s your judgement now; the judgement you make on this mirror man you gotta carry… I am God and I’ve killed everyone, now what? It does not improve your issue any. …\n        …What you are doing is you’re creating a legend, you are creating a beast, you are creating whatever you judge yourselves with into the word <AdditionalInformation>Manson</AdditionalInformation>, and that’s not me at all, man!…”\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            The 99 Problems of the 99 Percent are One\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        In the last century, slowly but surely, we managed to “kill God” under many respects, but we haven’t really opened our hearts to a valid alternative source of enlightenment yet. Those who are successful think they don’t need it; those who aren’t rarely look any further than the particular issue they have at heart. One can only be either with us or against us on any issue – veganism, climate activism, feminism, you name it. We are harsh judges of ourselves and others, and our radicalist sectarian approach to the dismantling of outdated values prevents us from seeing that our different problems, traumas and wishes are connected in many ways. This works in favor of our common enemy: we’re still playing by its individualist rules.\n        \n        Spoiler alert: in <Name>The Doom Generation</Name>, our favorite “band of outsiders” are, unsurprisingly, headed for a violent epilogue. <AdditionalInformation>Amy</AdditionalInformation>, <AdditionalInformation>Jordan</AdditionalInformation> and <AdditionalInformation>Xavier</AdditionalInformation> are tracked down by a bunch of homophobic Nazis to the abandoned warehouse where they are hiding and engaging in their first passionate, liberating act of collective sex. The Nazis quite literally “put our their fire” right before <AdditionalInformation>Jordan</AdditionalInformation> and <AdditionalInformation>Xavier</AdditionalInformation> can continue enjoying their intimacy without <AdditionalInformation>Amy</AdditionalInformation>, and proceed to brutally torture and rape them in the goriest ways imaginable. <AdditionalInformation>Jordan</AdditionalInformation>, a sweet and dreamy creature filled with wonder and love, but also loaded with fears and self-doubt, pays the highest price; or does he? In any case, they were doomed; their trip ended before their journey towards boundless, universal love was complete, but the same doesn’t have to happen to us.\n    </Body>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while enhancing readability and structure through the use of XML tags that correspond to the specified attributes in the ADT.",

After a clunky prologue that chooses to place this refugee crisis in a dystopian future where women and children are being caged and murdered (instead of just actual refugee hotspots around the world in the 2020s), “Nowhere” becomes a single-setting, single-character survival story. Here’s where the movie almost works consistently, centering a woman who will do whatever it takes to keep herself and new newborn baby alive. There are some disappointing choices in the film’s directing, but Castillo’s performance should make a lot of those easy to overlook for anyone who stumbles upon this one in their streaming algorithm.\n\nCastillo plays Mia, the very pregnant partner of Nico (Tamar Novas). We meet the couple already on the run from a country in a violent crisis. They hide from dogs and helicopter spotlights in a cargo yard before entering one of the shipping containers, bound for freedom. Of course, the journey doesn’t go well, and the couple ends up split up into two separate containers. Nico goes off to what looks like it will be a violent end while Mia is stuck with a bunch of strangers before their vessel is captured by soldiers, and, well, everyone but Mia ends up murdered. Before you know it, Mia is adrift in the ocean with few supplies and no way to get home. And then she goes into labor.\n\n“Nowhere” is at its best when it’s at its most deliberate—Mia trying to pry open the roof, figuring out how to fish, etc. These easily relatable beats fit the most basic of survival tale tenets: Allowing us to ask ourselves how we would act in the same situation. Could we figure out how to survive for an unknown amount of time in the middle of nowhere? Would we just cry and wait for death? The added dynamic of a newborn child shifts the stakes from a traditional survivor’s story. Mia isn’t just trying to keep herself alive; she’s fighting for her baby, a fact made more poignant that she already lost a child before all of this drama started.\n\nDirector Albert Pinto gets everything from Castillo, an actress who first seems a bit overly mannered (it’s really just the bad dialogue of the opening scenes) but settles in nicely after she gives birth and becomes a force of survival instinct. The suspension of disbelief for a movie like this gets a nice elevation from the maternal hook. We’ve all heard those stories about mothers lifting cars to save their children. Castillo sells the idea that giving up isn’t an option more for her child than herself.\n\n“Nowhere” has some clunky filmmaking, as with the container’s internal space, which I wish was better conveyed. There’s a version that’s more claustrophobic and sharp—where the interior doesn’t feel quite so much like a set—and some of the editing here is hyper when a stronger take would have longer shots and establish the time that Mia is stuck out there and the feeling of desperation. And it doesn’t help that “Nowhere” becomes repetitive over nearly two hours. I’m also not sure about where this film lands in terms of what it’s trying to say. It’s probably best to leave analysis of all the vague commentary on the refugee crisis aside and just appreciate “Nowhere” as a reminder of the power of a mother’s will to live. And to save.\n\nOn Netflix now.\n\nNow streaming on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Brian Tallerico\n\nBrian Tallerico is the Managing Editor of RogerEbert.com, and also covers television, film, Blu-ray, and video games.

The film was directed by Tamra Davis, co-written by Chappelle and Neal Brennan and produced by Robert Simonds. Half Baked was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on January 16, 1998. It received negative reviews and grossed $17.5 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nFour lifelong stoners and friends (Thurgood, Scarface, Brian, and Kenny) live together in New York City. Thurgood, a janitor at a medical lab, orders some weed from Samson, the famous local dealer, and the four smoke it. When Kenny, a gentle kindergarten teacher, is out on a munchie run, he is arrested for accidentally killing a diabetic police horse called Buttercup by feeding it junk food. His friends are forced to raise $1 million to bail him out before the other prisoners take advantage of his gentle nature. While visiting Kenny in prison, Thurgood meets Mary Jane and pursues a romantic relationship, which is strained by his having to conceal his marijuana smoking from her, as she is adamantly anti-drug.\n\nThurgood gets asked one day by a scientist at the lab to get a pound of cannabis from storage and Thurgood freaks out when he realizes what the scientist had him get. The grateful scientist thanks Thurgood for the good deed by giving him some free weed. Thurgood brings it home and the three friends get high. Scarface gets the idea to have Thurgood steal medical marijuana from his work so that the three of them can sell it to raise money to free Kenny.\n\nWhen the success of the friends' marijuana business grows enough to raise the ire of local drug lord Samson Simpson, Samson extorts them for $20,000 a week, while Mary Jane dumps Thurgood when she finds out he is dealing drugs. The friends plan a robbery of the medical laboratory to increase their earnings enough to both fend off Samson and free Kenny, but are arrested when they try to execute the plan.\n\nThurgood strikes a deal with the police to wear a wire to a meeting with Samson in exchange for freeing Kenny and dropping the charges against him and his friends. They meet with Samson, but their plan is exposed when the police detectives fail to arrive as backup since they are high. However, Thurgood and his friends are able to take out Samson's henchwomen, and Samson is taken out by the ghost of Jerry Garcia. The police detectives arrive soon after to arrest Samson and his henchwomen, while Thurgood and friends are released from police custody. Thurgood meets with Mary Jane to tell her he is giving up marijuana and wants to get back together. The film ends with their reuniting.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Dave Chappelle as Thurgood / Sir Smoka Lot\n- Guillermo Díaz as Scarface\n- Jim Breuer as Brian\n- Harland Williams as Kenny\n- Rachel True as Mary Jane\n- Clarence Williams III as Samson Simpson\n- Laura Silverman as Jan\n- Tommy Chong as Squirrel Master\n- R.

From its opening scene, as Pickford (Shawn Andrews) drives his iconic orange Pontiac GTO through the school parking lot to Aerosmith’s “Sweet Emotion”, it is clear that this film is going to be a good time. Right off the bat the audience is sucked into this world and transported to Austin Texas in 1976. From the clothing that the characters wear to the music that plays throughout the film, it is easy to find yourself wishing you could have even just a taste of what life would have been like as a high schooler in the 1970s.\n\nThe film follows a group of Texas high schoolers on their last day of school in 1976. With many of the characters going into their senior year and few who will soon enter into the wild world that is high school, they all come together seeking a party that will live on forever. The funny thing is, it has. To all of the people who continue to watch this film and geek out over its nostalgia and iconic one-liners, the party at the moontower will live on forever. Part of what makes Dazed and Confused so great is Linklater’s ability to create not only a film but an experience. When I watch this film, for that hour and forty-three minutes, I feel as if I am there with these characters. That, to me, is what makes Dazed and Confused so special and I think that is a huge part of why it still has such a dedicated following almost 30 years later.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRichard Linklater on the Set of Dazed and Confused with Actors Rory Cochrane, Jason London and Sasha Jenson.\n\nOddly enough, something that draws me to Dazed and Confused is the fact that it has no real plot. When it comes down to it, the only real objective that these characters have is to find a way to have a good time. Most of the film is filled with shots of the various characters driving around Austin in their attractive cars with their friends in the back. There is something that feels so natural about that. I love the way in which something so simple, and even mundane, can create a film that is enjoyed by so many. It is almost as if to say that a movie doesn’t have to be some big, extravagant event in order to be considered “good”. A film can be realistic and simple and still be loved. With Dazed and Confused, Linklater, portrays a real version of what the high school experience is like. It is in no way “done up” or glamorized in any which way, it is simply just what it is and it never tries too hard to be anything else.\n\nDespite the film taking place over the course of a single day, all of the characters manage to be well rounded and entertaining. Each and every character (that is of the ones who have their own storyline) represent someone that we all knew in high school. Meaning, it is easy to see yourself in a lot of these characters when you really pay close enough attention. Let’s take Ron Slater (Rory Cochrane) as an example. On the outside, Slater is a stoner and a slacker; however, when you look closely, he’s just like any other high school student. He is living in the moment and taking life as it comes. He isn’t worried or stressed about what life will bring because, right now, he is completely free. Slater doesn’t have any responsibility or any real life problems because he is still just figuring himself out. Just like any other high schooler, he probably has no idea what he wants to do with his life. On the other hand, there is Randall “Pink” Flloyd (Jason London). To Pink deciding whether or not to play football next season is the biggest choice of his life. He doesn’t want to live by anyone else’s rules and if playing ball means he has to do that, he refuses. This in itself is the epitome of a high school problem, which in turns shows us how simple and almost carefree high school is. These kids are all figuring out their lives. They have no idea what the next day or month or year will bring. That feeling is enhanced by the fact that no one will ever know. The film ends before anyone ever gets to see what will happen. All that matters is this one night. In my mind, this is what Dazed and Confused is all about. It doesn’t matter what happens next, all that matters is that they are able to live in that moment and experience life while they can, and while it is still simple.\n\nAs the film comes to an end, there is one scene that always makes me feel kind of sad. That scene takes place as the party at the moontower comes to a close. As people leave the party, Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Tuesday’s Gone” plays in the background. It is clear that the film is coming to an end because of the subtle shift in tone. As the scene goes on and we see many characters saying goodbye to one another, it begins to feel as if there is a kind of loss of innocence. After this night, they will all go back to their normal lives and they will inch closer and closer to their senior year, their last year of absolute freedom from the responsibility of adult life. Without fail, everytime I watch Dazed and Confused the film evokes the feeling of a time when things were not so complicated. It points to a time that was all about the freedom to simply have a good time, and although we may not realize it, there is no experience in life quite like high school. The film ends with Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins), one of the freshmen characters, putting on his headphones and a huge smile. Then we cut to Pink and his friends on the open road on their way to get Aerosmith tickets. To me, it is the perfect ending to a fantastic film about the reality of high school and all of the freedom it allows.\n\n## 2 Responses\n\n- Marie Alessandro .comment-author .vcard February 11, 2021 at 6:01 am | Permalink Until now I have not been drawn to watch this movie.

Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an examination of the fall of American counterculture. During the 1960s, young people began to reject the conservative views of their parents and took to the streets in a collective rebellion to protest society’s greatest ills—specifically the mounting violence and corruption of the Vietnam War and the racial, social, and gender inequality of American society. By 1970, it became clear that the…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The American Dream\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas focuses on Raoul Duke, a California journalist, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they travel from Los Angeles, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in a drug-fueled search for the American Dream. Duke’s understanding of the American Dream assumes that anyone, with a little luck and “true grit,” can succeed and prosper in America, and when he is assigned a story in Las Vegas, he figures it…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Drugs and American Society\n\nNearly every page of Hunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas mentions illegal drug use in some way, and when narrator and California journalist Raoul Duke is tasked with covering a local sporting event in Las Vegas, he takes with him his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, and a huge bag of drugs, including “two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGet the entire  LitChart as a  printable PDF.\n\n\"My students can't get enough of your charts and their results have gone through the roof.\" -Graham S.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## News and Journalism\n\nHunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a piece of “Gonzo journalism”—a form of “New journalism” invented by Thompson himself that rejects the objectivity of traditional journalism and instead relies on an individual, first-person account of any given event. Whereas traditional journalism seeks to disclose objective and absolute truth, Gonzo journalism assumes that absolute truth does not exist, which results in a strange blend of fact and fiction that reveals personal truth…\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Violence\n\nViolence is everywhere in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. As Duke and Dr. Gonzo travel to Las Vegas in a drug-fueled search for the American Dream, they both engage in violent behavior and see violence reflected in the world around them.

I was in college and a movie about young, edgy people working together in an independent music store sounded fun. At first blush, the movie comes off as a bunch of posturing young people that aren't comfortable in their own skin. That element is there, to be sure, but to treat the movie as \"Just Another Teenage Movie\" would be to miss out on a powerful under-riding narrative of collectivism and anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nIn the movie, the Empire records store was established with what lines up fairly closely with the beginning of rock and roll. (blues and jazz predate rock, but the important aspect is the anti-authoritarianism of rock that functions as the ethos of the store and its employees).\n\nBut it's not a pure attack on conformity and authority. Anti-authoritarianism cuts both ways in the movie. The rock star who's come to town represents a pure kind of anti-authoritarianism. Yet, he's also \"the man\" that the good folk at Empire Records discover they want to stick it to. Consider the star's name--Rex Manning--which means king of men. Rex is the king of Rock. Rex is the essence of rock ’n roll. When Corey, the Harvard girl, seduces him and he obliges, saying “Rock ’n Roll,” she realizes she doesn’t want to cast off all of society’s constraints. She discovers that she’s really looking for a more traditional relational model. Something more stable.\n\nEnter Joe, the anti-authorial manager of empire records. He operates as a protector for all the troubled young people that work for him. His version of rock ’n roll is less anarchic than Rex’s. Yes, he plays the drums, smokes cigars, drinks beer, and even hits one of his employees--Lucas, but he also flouts the rules, turning in a bank bag stuffed with paper to cover for the very kid he hit.\n\nSo, the balance here is not a complete rejection of authority; rather, the question is what type of authority is allowed/allowable. Unlike Rex’s \"anything goes” approach, Joe provides loose guidance, even presiding over a group therapy session when the youth under his watch need it.\n\nEssentially, the Empire Records store presents a sort of utopia. The chief rules with reason rather than emotion. When confronted by the bodies of the young women that work for him, he is stoic. He offers them counsel, not himself. When money runs out, everyone pools their resources to ensure their way of life can continue.\n\nIt is potentially confusing why Lucas is put in charge at the beginning of the action. But Joe makes this decision because he is at a loss of how to move forward with the issues of power and finance that threaten the store.\n\nJoe tells Lucas not touch the cigars, beer, drum sticks. Joe knows that all of his rules will be broken.\nHe wants Lucas to break the rules. Joe needs Lucas to shake things up because Joe is incapable of making a non-rational decision. Consider that Joe never calls the cops on Lucas. This is because he put Lucas in charge for a reason. The reason is the good of the Empire Records community.\n\nThere’s a sort of anarcho-syndicalism there.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n\"Anarcho-syndicalism is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and thus control influence in broader society.\"\n\nThrough the records store, the employees are able to change their society. They regulate what is accepted/acceptable. For instance, they judge that Rex Manning is a threat, a figure that aggrandizes himself only, and they cast him out.\n\nEmpire Records is the sort of place where quarters are glued to the floor. Money is less important than the community. It's the sort of place where the down and outs can go and get a job, get friendship, as evinced in \"Warren Beatty's\" episode. He comes in with a gun and a lot of anger. But his desire is merely to be accepted. Importantly, police haul Beatty away from the store on two occasions, but their authority is limited. Warren returns to the store after the police take him away both times. Traditional measures of discipline are meaningless in the world of Empire Records. Punishment doesn't make sense in a society that takes care of those at the bottom. Once the individual becomes part of the collective, though they still have their problems to work through, they are supported and operate in a space where they can freely express themselves. They have a space of self-expression protected by their collective unity.\n\nNow, if you want to watch a really good movie, you're probably better of watching Hi-Fidelity than Empire Records. It's also highly likely that the film-makers didn't mean to write in an anarcho-syndicalist collective. Likely, the writers were going for a \"Save the Farm\" or \"Save the Orphanage\" kind of plot with a Gen X angle. But anarcho-syndicalism sounds so much cooler, doesn't it?\n\nEnd Transmission\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRapid Transmission provides analysis and critique of science fiction and other cultural texts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Books by Joseph Hurtgen\n\n- The Archive Incarnate\n\n## Mailing List\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Blade Runner - Analysis of Roy Batty's Final Monologue\n- Top 100 Sci Fi Books List\n- Sci-fi Noir: The Terminator and Tech Noir | 10 Updates to Film Noir\n- High-Tech Corrupted Worlds: A Discussion with Elias J.

I was in college and a movie about young, edgy people working together in an independent music store sounded fun. At first blush, the movie comes off as a bunch of posturing young people that aren't comfortable in their own skin. That element is there, to be sure, but to treat the movie as \"Just Another Teenage Movie\" would be to miss out on a powerful under-riding narrative of <Themes>collectivism and anarcho-syndicalism</Themes>.</p>\n\n        <p>In the movie, the <storeName>Empire Records</storeName> store was established with what lines up fairly closely with the beginning of rock and roll. (blues and jazz predate rock, but the important aspect is the anti-authoritarianism of rock that functions as the ethos of the store and its employees).</p>\n\n        <p>But it's not a pure attack on conformity and authority. Anti-authoritarianism cuts both ways in the movie. The rock star who's come to town represents a pure kind of anti-authoritarianism. Yet, he's also \"the man\" that the good folk at <storeName>Empire Records</storeName> discover they want to stick it to. Consider the star's name--Rex Manning--which means king of men. Rex is the king of Rock. Rex is the essence of rock ’n roll. When Corey, the Harvard girl, seduces him and he obliges, saying “Rock ’n Roll,” she realizes she doesn’t want to cast off all of society’s constraints. She discovers that she’s really looking for a more traditional relational model. Something more stable.</p>\n\n        <p>Enter Joe, the anti-authorial manager of <storeName>Empire Records</storeName>. He operates as a protector for all the troubled young people that work for him. His version of rock ’n roll is less anarchic than Rex’s. Yes, he plays the drums, smokes cigars, drinks beer, and even hits one of his employees--Lucas, but he also flouts the rules, turning in a bank bag stuffed with paper to cover for the very kid he hit.</p>\n\n        <p>So, the balance here is not a complete rejection of authority; rather, the question is what type of authority is allowed/allowable.

My journey into film analysis, particularly with classics like Pulp Fiction, is fueled by a deep appreciation for the intricacies of visual storytelling. Through this analysis, I’ll explore Pulp Fiction‘s cinematography, focusing on how it masterfully integrates lighting, composition, and camera techniques to enhance Quentin Tarantino’s chaotic, engaging narrative. Each section reflects my perspective as a colorist and filmmaker, examining how Andrzej Sekuła’s cinematographic choices contributed to the iconic visual language of this film.\n\n## Cinematography Analysis Of Pulp Fiction (in Depth)\n\n### About the Cinematographer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cinematography of Pulp Fiction was a collaboration between Quentin Tarantino and cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, whose approach was both raw and authentic. Sekuła’s work aligns closely with Tarantino’s vision, as it avoids glamorous visuals, opting instead for a grounded style that mirrors the gritty world of the film’s characters. This synergy between director and cinematographer allowed for a unique visual experience that prioritizes storytelling over stylized aesthetics, embracing unpolished, organic textures. Sekuła’s choices create an immersive, chaotic world where every camera angle, light source, and lens serves to reflect the unpredictable nature of the story.\n\n### Inspiration for the Cinematography of Pulp Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSekula and Tarantino took cues from an array of cinematic influences—film noir, crime genres, and postmodern references. These references infuse Pulp Fiction with a strikingly eclectic style, where high art and pop culture blend seamlessly. The film’s visual style often nods to French New Wave, particularly Jean-Luc Godard, as well as to classic noir and pulp magazine aesthetics. This merging of genres provides a layered viewing experience, where noir lighting, bold colors, and pop culture references coexist in a deliberately stylized landscape. The cinematography here goes beyond mere homage; it makes Pulp Fiction a love letter to cinema itself, constantly referencing and reinterpreting iconic styles from cinematic history.\n\n### Camera Movements Used in Pulp Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSekuła’s camera movements are fluid yet controlled, capturing a sense of immediacy without overpowering the story. One of the most notable techniques is the use of tracking shots, like the tense sequence following Butch through his apartment, where the continuous motion builds suspense. Slow zoom-ins appear throughout the film, providing a voyeuristic feel to scenes that demand a heightened sense of discomfort or intimacy. In contrast, handheld shots inject a rough, almost documentary-like realism that intensifies the film’s gritty texture. These varied approaches make the camera a silent participant, adding to the raw, visceral quality of each scene and drawing viewers directly into the action.\n\n### Compositions in Pulp Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSekula’s compositions are meticulously designed to underscore the tension and dynamic relationships between characters. In the iconic restaurant scene with Vincent and Mia, the framing reflects their complex connection—their bodies angled apart but eyes locked, conveying both distance and intrigue. By using tight framing in intimate, confined spaces like Butch’s apartment, the film amplifies the claustrophobia and isolation of the characters, allowing audiences to feel the same heightened tension the characters are experiencing. This tight framing contrasts with the use of wide shots during moments of violence, which brings a stark, unsettling realism to these scenes and adds an element of unpredictability that keeps viewers on edge.\n\n### Lighting Style of Pulp Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSekula’s lighting is often hard and high-contrast, intensifying the raw, atmospheric tone of Pulp Fiction. Practical lighting adds a sense of realism, but there are also scenes where lighting is exaggerated to emphasize mood over accuracy. For example, the diner scene’s harsh lighting amplifies the anxiety of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, while creating intense shadows that draw viewers’ attention to specific facial features. In other sequences, like the one where Jules and Vincent confront their victims, intense contrast and sharp shadows lend a menacing, dramatic effect. The film’s lighting is flexible, adapting from scene to scene to suit the emotional needs of each moment, sometimes stepping away from realism to evoke a stylized, almost theatrical intensity.\n\n### Lensing and Blocking in Pulp Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWide-angle lenses and intentional blocking create an intimate yet immersive viewing experience. Sekula’s lensing emphasizes the physicality of the characters, bringing the viewer up close to their expressions and body language. For instance, wide lenses exaggerate close-up shots, making the viewer feel almost uncomfortably close to the action. Blocking is equally significant, as Tarantino’s direction often places characters at different levels or depths within the frame to signify power dynamics. In the diner scene, the blocking subtly conveys Pumpkin and Honey Bunny’s partnership while highlighting their individual personalities. Meanwhile, during Jules and Vincent’s interrogation scenes, the duo’s imposing positioning asserts their authority. These choices reinforce each character’s narrative importance and deepen our understanding of their interpersonal dynamics.\n\n### Color of Pulp Fiction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe color palette of Pulp Fiction is deliberately bold and eclectic, echoing the chaotic nature of its narrative. Rich, saturated reds, blues, and yellows punctuate the film, lending a comic-book aesthetic that captures the “pulp” essence. This diverse color scheme reflects the fragmented, multi-layered storylines, with each hue reinforcing the film’s postmodern tone. Tarantino’s use of color is both symbolic and functional—the iconic glow of the briefcase, for instance, serves as a mysterious focal point, paying homage to classic noir. The vibrant tones of Jack Rabbit Slim’s, with its neon pop-art feel, contrast with the earthy, subdued tones in Butch’s scenes, creating a vivid and memorable visual landscape that is unique to Pulp Fiction.\n\n### Technical Aspects: Camera, Lenses, etc.\n\nThe technical choices in Pulp Fiction reinforce its gritty aesthetic. Sekula used the ARRIFLEX 35mm camera paired with Zeiss lenses, known for their sharpness and ability to capture detail. Shooting on 35mm film gave Pulp Fiction a grainy, textured look that digital formats lack, grounding the film’s visual style in the pulp genre’s roughness. The lens choices—often wide-angle—enhanced close-up shots by making the viewer feel almost uncomfortably close to the characters. The grain, combined with Sekula’s blocking and lighting, highlights both the beauty and harshness of each scene, echoing the volatile, fragmented energy of the film’s narrative structure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cinematography of Pulp Fiction stands as a masterclass in visual storytelling, combining eclectic influences with a distinctly modern style. Sekula and Tarantino have crafted a visual narrative that not only tells a story but also serves as a commentary on the art of cinema itself. Each element—camera movement, composition, lighting, lensing, and color—contributes to a complex, multi-dimensional viewing experience. Sekula’s choices go beyond merely enhancing the story; they elevate it, turning Pulp Fiction into an unforgettable cinematic experience that challenges conventions and leaves a lasting visual imprint. Through its visual style, Pulp Fiction has earned its place as a cultural landmark and a touchstone of postmodern filmmaking.\n\n- Also Read: CINEMATOGRAPHY ANALYSIS OF CITY LIGHTS (IN DEPTH)\n- Also Read: CINEMATOGRAPHY ANALYSIS OF ORDET (IN DEPTH)\n\n## Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

These references infuse <name>Pulp Fiction</name> with a strikingly eclectic style, where high art and pop culture blend seamlessly. The film’s visual style often nods to French New Wave, particularly <director>Jean-Luc Godard</director>, as well as to classic noir and pulp magazine aesthetics. This merging of genres provides a layered viewing experience, where noir lighting, bold colors, and pop culture references coexist in a deliberately stylized landscape. The cinematography here goes beyond mere homage; it makes <name>Pulp Fiction</name> a love letter to cinema itself, constantly referencing and reinterpreting iconic styles from cinematic history.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Camera Movements Used in Pulp Fiction</title>\n        <content>\n            <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer>’s camera movements are fluid yet controlled, capturing a sense of immediacy without overpowering the story. One of the most notable techniques is the use of tracking shots, like the tense sequence following Butch through his apartment, where the continuous motion builds suspense. Slow zoom-ins appear throughout the film, providing a voyeuristic feel to scenes that demand a heightened sense of discomfort or intimacy. In contrast, handheld shots inject a rough, almost documentary-like realism that intensifies the film’s gritty texture. These varied approaches make the camera a silent participant, adding to the raw, visceral quality of each scene and drawing viewers directly into the action.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Compositions in Pulp Fiction</title>\n        <content>\n            <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer>’s compositions are meticulously designed to underscore the tension and dynamic relationships between characters. In the iconic restaurant scene with Vincent and Mia, the framing reflects their complex connection—their bodies angled apart but eyes locked, conveying both distance and intrigue. By using tight framing in intimate, confined spaces like Butch’s apartment, the film amplifies the claustrophobia and isolation of the characters, allowing audiences to feel the same heightened tension the characters are experiencing. This tight framing contrasts with the use of wide shots during moments of violence, which brings a stark, unsettling realism to these scenes and adds an element of unpredictability that keeps viewers on edge.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Lighting Style of Pulp Fiction</title>\n        <content>\n            <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer>’s lighting is often hard and high-contrast, intensifying the raw, atmospheric tone of <name>Pulp Fiction</name>. Practical lighting adds a sense of realism, but there are also scenes where lighting is exaggerated to emphasize mood over accuracy. For example, the diner scene’s harsh lighting amplifies the anxiety of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, while creating intense shadows that draw viewers’ attention to specific facial features. In other sequences, like the one where Jules and Vincent confront their victims, intense contrast and sharp shadows lend a menacing, dramatic effect. The film’s lighting is flexible, adapting from scene to scene to suit the emotional needs of each moment, sometimes stepping away from realism to evoke a stylized, almost theatrical intensity.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Lensing and Blocking in Pulp Fiction</title>\n        <content>\n            Wide-angle lenses and intentional blocking create an intimate yet immersive viewing experience. <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer>’s lensing emphasizes the physicality of the characters, bringing the viewer up close to their expressions and body language. For instance, wide lenses exaggerate close-up shots, making the viewer feel almost uncomfortably close to the action. Blocking is equally significant, as <director>Tarantino</director>’s direction often places characters at different levels or depths within the frame to signify power dynamics. In the diner scene, the blocking subtly conveys Pumpkin and Honey Bunny’s partnership while highlighting their individual personalities. Meanwhile, during Jules and Vincent’s interrogation scenes, the duo’s imposing positioning asserts their authority. These choices reinforce each character’s narrative importance and deepen our understanding of their interpersonal dynamics.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Color of Pulp Fiction</title>\n        <content>\n            The color palette of <name>Pulp Fiction</name> is deliberately bold and eclectic, echoing the chaotic nature of its narrative. Rich, saturated reds, blues, and yellows punctuate the film, lending a comic-book aesthetic that captures the “pulp” essence. This diverse color scheme reflects the fragmented, multi-layered storylines, with each hue reinforcing the film’s postmodern tone. <director>Tarantino</director>’s use of color is both symbolic and functional—the iconic glow of the briefcase, for instance, serves as a mysterious focal point, paying homage to classic noir. The vibrant tones of Jack Rabbit Slim’s, with its neon pop-art feel, contrast with the earthy, subdued tones in Butch’s scenes, creating a vivid and memorable visual landscape that is unique to <name>Pulp Fiction</name>.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Technical Aspects: Camera, Lenses, etc.</title>\n        <content>\n            The technical choices in <name>Pulp Fiction</name> reinforce its gritty aesthetic. <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer> used the ARRIFLEX 35mm camera paired with Zeiss lenses, known for their sharpness and ability to capture detail. Shooting on 35mm film gave <name>Pulp Fiction</name> a grainy, textured look that digital formats lack, grounding the film’s visual style in the pulp genre’s roughness. The lens choices—often wide-angle—enhanced close-up shots by making the viewer feel almost uncomfortably close to the characters. The grain, combined with <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer>’s blocking and lighting, highlights both the beauty and harshness of each scene, echoing the volatile, fragmented energy of the film’s narrative structure.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <title>Conclusion</title>\n        <content>\n            The cinematography of <name>Pulp Fiction</name> stands as a masterclass in visual storytelling, combining eclectic influences with a distinctly modern style. <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer> and <director>Tarantino</director> have crafted a visual narrative that not only tells a story but also serves as a commentary on the art of cinema itself. Each element—camera movement, composition, lighting, lensing, and color—contributes to a complex, multi-dimensional viewing experience. <cinematographer>Sekuła</cinematographer>’s choices go beyond merely enhancing the story; they elevate it, turning <name>Pulp Fiction</name> into an unforgettable cinematic experience that challenges conventions and leaves a lasting visual imprint. Through its visual style, <name>Pulp Fiction</name> has earned its place as a cultural landmark and a touchstone of postmodern filmmaking.\n        </content>\n    </section>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to include the required and optional attributes from the ADT, ensuring that the information remains clear and accessible while highlighting key terms and segments with XML tags.",

I have to thank my mother for that. When I was a teenager, still living with my parents and a new cinephile, I used to go to that video renting store on Friday at the end of the school week where I rented new-to-me classics that I’d often watch with my mother and that she’ll discover along with me. Rebel Without a Cause, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, The Wild One, Bonnie &amp; Clyde, etc. were among those. But, as I said, Thelma &amp; Louise was a film my mother had seen before, and her recommendation was based on the fact that I had loved Bonnie &amp; Clyde. The story is different, but with the armed robbery and the overall road trip concept, there is a connection. My mother knew me well because I absolutely loved it, and it’s still a favourite today.\n\nSo, I think it was about time for me to discuss it. When Rob from MovieRob contacted his little crew to see if we were interested in participating in his Genre Grandeur, I thought I really should this time since I missed so many of those. The concept of what is also known as “GG” is simple. Each month, a blogger picked by Rob chooses a genre, and those who wish to participate write a review of a favourite film connected to that genre. The genre chosen can be broad. It’s not just drama or comedy as “genre” is used as a vast term. So, this month, we’re exploring films that feature and take place in desert areas. Paul of The People’s Movies chose the theme. And you see me coming. Because of its last act, I went with Thelma &amp; Louise. I could have taken Lawrence of Arabia because I love that film, but I already reviewed it on my blog.\n\nThelma &amp; Louise was directed by Ridley Scott (my favourite film of his) and released in 1991. The screenplay is by Callie Khouri (the fact that it was written by a woman is very important to consider). The film stars Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, and Harvey Keitel and features Michael Madsen, Christophe McDonalds, Brad Pitt, Timothy Carhart and Stephen Tobolowsky.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBefore going further with the film, I rarely do this, but that review will contain some spoilers, especially since the last act is crucial when discussing the desert landscapes of the film. I will try to indicate them as much as possible. So, if you haven’t seen it yet, you can skip those parts. But, to be honest, if you haven’t seen it, I don’t know what you are waiting for!\n\n***\n\nThelma Dickinson (Geena Davis) and Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon) are two best friends planning to go on a fishing trip in the mountains for the weekend. They both live pretty ordinary lives in Arkansas. Thelma is a housewife who has to bear with her insufferable husband, Darryl (Christopher McDonalds), a carpet salesman who doesn’t give a shit about his wife and expects her to be home all the time to prepare meals and clean. Louise is busy working as a waitress in a breakfast restaurant and dates Jimmy Lennox (Michael Madsen), a musician, but things seem complicated. Anyway, after an act of rebellion on Thelma’s behalf, aka not asking her husband’s permission to go on a trip with Louise, the two friends are on their way for some fun and to forget their boring daily life. On the road, they stop at a roadhouse bar for a pause and to have a drink. There’s a band playing country music, and people line dancing. It’s overall a pretty festive ambience. A man, Harlan Puckett (Timothy Carhart), spots Thelma and immediately starts flirting with her. The latter, now carefree and out of her trap, doesn’t seem to mind much, but Louise finds him dull and annoying. She doesn’t hesitate to blow her cigarette smoke in his face (and that’s honestly one of my favourite parts of the film). Harlan and Thelma end up dancing together and let’s say that Harlan doesn’t give Thelma much space. At some point, Louise goes to the bathroom and warns Thelma that they’ll be on their way after that.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeanwhile, Thelma, who’s not feeling well after drinking lots of alcohol and spinning endlessly on the dance floor, says to Harlan that she has to go out for a breath of fresh air. He follows her and starts flirting with her in the parking lot and starts to be very tactile. Thelma, who’s not down for that anymore, asks him to stop. He instantly shows his true terrible nature and rapes her after slapping her face a few times. It is violent and always difficult to watch. He hasn’t heard Louise coming, and the latter points a gun at him and tells him to stop. As idiot as he is, he says something in the likes of “We were just having some fun”. To what Louise answers, her face and voice full of rage, “When a woman is crying like that, she is not having any fun!” Harlan, a disgusting rag, says he should have continued. Louise, full of hangers, ends up shooting him.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe two women drive off. Thelma suggests to call the police. Louise, who knows the justice system won’t play in their favour (and she’s right), prefers to run away. Therefore starts the wild escape of Thelma and Louise, full of danger and excitement. They are running for their life, in search of a better one, now that they can’t look back. On this transformative road trip, they will meet more men, such as the handsome JD (Brad Pitt), an ex-convict on parole. Jimmy will surprise Louise in a motel. Thelma will learn the art of armed robbery. Above all, they will stick together no matter what because that is how strong the power of friendship is. Detective Hal Slocumb (Harvey Keitel) is on the case, and he seems to be the only man who tries to understand the two ladies and doesn’t want anything bad to happen to them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n***\n\nWhen Callie Khouri started developing the project in 1988, she was inspired by her own friendship with country singer Pam Tillis. And Thelma &amp; Louise is, first and foremost, a true ode to the strength of female bounds and friendship, a direct dive into a form of sisterhood where the connection surpasses the differences of character and contradicted personalities. Thelma and Louise are already established friends as the film begins. We don’t know for how long they’ve been friends. They are about in their mid-thirties, so they could have been friends since childhood or high school. Maybe something that simply clicked with them in recent years, a friendly love at first sight. On my side, I opt for the old friendship option. I feel like they could have become friends during high school, a time when friendships are deeply meaningful. I can perfectly picture Louise warning Thelma against marrying the stupid Darryl. I mean, where does this guy come from? He certainly doesn’t match Thelma’s sense of fun and repressed sense of adventure. In that sense, Louise acts as the elder sister figure in the duo. You feel she had more experience in life than Thelma and is here to protect her. Not just after the story’s catalyst but overall, making sure Thelma is alright. On her side, Thelma has so much to discover about life. In just a few day’s trip, she’ll live a lifetime, and her transformation is genuine. Thelma is the unlucky one of the story, especially with men who abuse her in many ways. Louise is a victim of that as well, but at least she has Jimmy, who overall seems to be an ok guy. You also feel that Detective Slocumb is on her side, knowing about her past history in Texas (a taboo subject for Louise) and acting as a compassionate figure although he is on the side of the law that the two ladies are running away from.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith this in mind, the road trip idea is of primary importance. It cements Thelma and Louise’s friendship but also provokes a noteworthy change of roles. Louise, who’s the leader and sort of has a “bad girl” aura in the sense that she works and isn’t married, eventually becomes the little sister guided by Thelma’s motivation and will to go on no matter what. This turn of situation, although gradual, is particularly noticeable when [SPOILER] after a torrid night between Thelma and the sexy JD (Brad Pitt), the two friends discover that the latter, an imposter, has stolen the $ 6000 brought in person by Jimmy to help the girls. That is the last straw for Louise, who collapses and bursts into tears on the motel room floor, unable to see the end of their problems. [END OF SPOILER] Thelma, who so far had been the one having those reactions, knows she’s now the one who has to lead the pack. After clumsily telling Louise everything will be alright, she takes a firmer tone and orders her to get up and look forward instead of looking back. That’s how Thelma is now: someone who has to leave her regrets and bad memories in the past and always prefers to discover what the future is saving for her. If there are obstacles on the way, she’ll do everything to surpass them, even if it means doing a hold-up in a road convenience store in the middle of nowhere or locking a policeman in the trunk of his police car. She’s fearless. Louise now becomes the one who “follows”, and she knows they will both end in the same place. Thelma’s behaviour and style also change as the film progresses. She goes from being the proper lady, always well-groomed, to the one wearing jeans and t-shirts and smoking cigarettes, something she doesn’t seem to have done before. At this point, she and Thelma know they have nothing to lose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough not the first choices, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were carefully selected to play the leading roles of Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. Geena Davis, already an Oscar in her pocket from The Accidental Tourist, delivers another Oscar-nominated performance as the fascinating Thelma. She’s simply sparkling and someone who, despite all the difficulties her character goes through, perfectly embodies the sense of fun. On her side, Susan Sarandon was in the film industry since the early 70s and was seen in other cult movies like The Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Hunger, already paving her way to exist in challenging films. Finding the right Louise took time, but, in the end, the final choice was the right one. Susan Sarandon perfectly embodies the maturity necessary for her character, as well as a woman with a traumatic past. One gaze, one twitch of the eye, is enough to embody her emotions. Although she lived difficult things, just like Thelma, she learns to look forward even tho she’s conscious of the danger. Sarandon was also nominated for an Oscar for her memorable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThelma &amp; Louise, aside from being a film about female friendship, depicts the injustices and inequalities women live in everyday life and with the justice system. In a way, Harlan is “executed” by Louise for the crime he committed. However, Louise, the executor, is now seen as a criminal even tho she was defending her friend. Thelma’s first idea after the incident is to go to the police, which is a big no-no for Louise, who knows they don’t have any proof to incriminate Harlan. Problems like that have always happened and still happen to this day. In a way, it’s Thelma and Louise’s words against Harlan’s, except he’s now dead, so it becomes difficult to reach conclusions for someone who isn’t a witness. And when you think of it, we, the spectators, are witnesses but helpless ones. Troubles with men go on, which gives place to an interesting herd of male supporting actors, starting with Brad Pitt as JD. Pitt was still on his way to stardom when playing in the film. As JD, he knows perfectly how to play the charisma card (I mean, it’s Brad Pitt), but also how to act a bit idiot and docile to create the false aura of the good pitiful guy and, therefore, reach his means. So, once again, Thelma falls into a trap, and she and Louise face an extra obstacle. Louise’s guy, Jimmy, is portrayed by Michael Madsen, who, despite having some hanger in him and having difficulty understanding Louise, remains a decent person whose feelings for Louise are real. He doesn’t want to put any more obstacles in her already challenging situation. When he returns home after seeing Louise, he’s welcomed by the police, who are here to question him about Louise. We see his surprised reaction, but that’s the only interaction seen between him and the police. We have no idea if he told them where and when he saw his girlfriend. [SPOILER] The police end up tracking the two women’s geographical position thanks to a phone call, and that’s how they eventually manage to find them. [END OF SPOILER]. Michael Madsen plays against type in this film and is far from the eccentric and psychotic character we’ll see in the following year in Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough the interaction between Jimmy and the police has limited screen time, the situation is different with Thelma’s husband, Darryl, who has numerous interactions with the police, especially with Detective Slocumb. Christopher McDonald turns out to be the comic relief, although unintentional on Darryl’s part. I mean, you better take the guy seriously. So much so that he even makes the detective laugh when walking in his pizza that he left on the floor. That’s another one of my favourite moments in the film. Darryl likes to act as a very busy guy, but he’s just a spoiled teen Thelma has to look after. Interestingly, McDonald and Geena Davis were engaged in 1984, and he was thrilled to participate in this project with Davis. Maybe it was the right ingredient to play an “old couple” who can’t stand each other anymore, knowing they are trapped together. On his side, Harvey Keitel was already a well-established film figure after entering the 7th art during the “New Hollywood” Era, especially with Scorsese’s films like Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. His experience shows, and, aside from Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, he’s the best actor in the cast. He tactfully expresses the complexity of his character by not being over the top and making sure he can be a trustworthy figure. It kind of half works, but the intentions are here. The only time we truly see him lose his temper is when he interrogates JD, knowing that the two ladies might be in even deeper problems because of him.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere are a lot of great performances by Keitel, but this one might be my favourite because of how sincere it is. One of my favourite acting moments in the film is brief and involves him and Susan Sarandon. Louise is talking to Slocumb on the phone. She doesn’t want to admit her defeat, especially because she’s scared of what might happen next if she gets caught. At the end of the call, the detective, full of compassion and with a touch of sadness in his voice, tells Louise he knows why she is running away and what happened to her in Texas. After that, Louise, tears of rage in her eyes, ends the conversation. Although Slocumb uses the verb “knows” in “I know why you’re running away”, his delivery translates it as “I understand”. I’ll let you watch the scene here:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThelma &amp; Louise, although telling a difficult story, transposes the latter on a gorgeous filming support. The various American landscapes are magnified for the screen by the masterful work of English cinematographer Adrian Biddle. He manages to give an indescribable aura to the different places we encounter. It adds to the transformations the ladies live. We see a lot of desolate spaces that seem to have no ends, that will never reach busy civilisation, just like the two friends have taken a road to nowhere. Through the camera work, we feel the heaviness of those places. Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack (my favourite composition by him) adds mysticism to these places and is often heard in decisive moments. The ladies find a joie de vivre when driving and singing along with the music playing on the car radio. Those are various popular songs, such as” The Way You Do the Things You Do” by The Temptations.\n\nBefore going further, take the time to listen to one of Hans Zimmer’s pieces for the film, “Thuderbird”, and appreciate all the melancholy it embodies:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe visual beauty of the film and the soundtrack reach a common culminant point to what we are mostly writing this review for: the desert. After seeing a lot of different places through Arkansas and New Mexico, the duo reaches the creme de la creme of American landscapes: the Grand Canyon, finding themselves at the heart of the semi-desert area of Arizona. It’s a landscape that is beyond them and certainly larger than life. However, the ending was not shot at the Grand Canyon but at Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah, an imposing and infinite desert landscape. We also see the iconic Monument Valley, often used in Westerns or road movies like The Searchers or Easy Rider. Although the two ladies are running away for their lives and manage to challenge and surpass the many obstacles, their awe is well-transmitted when they finally reach these gorgeous but imposing sceneries. After a wild car chase with the police, they arrive next to the Grand Canyon’s precipice and can’t go further. If they turn back, they’ll get caught by the police with open arms. It’s windy and dry. They have sand all over their skins and hair and have reached the end of their possibilities. Or did they? [SPOILER] Remember how Thelma and Louise always want to go further. Instead of turning themselves down to the police, they decide to go forward. “Let’s keep going!”, Thelma says to Louise. The latter asks, “What do you mean?” although she knows perfectly what she means. Thelma has made up her mind, and Louise, a true pal to the very end, goes along with her. So, after a kiss, hands in hands, they go full-spin towards the precipice, and the blue Ford Thunderbird flies over the Grand Canyon. It became one of the most iconic images in cinema history. The two ladies, knowing they couldn’t face what society has in reserve for them, preferred to keep the souvenir of each other in that poetic but brutal final decision. [END OF SPOILER]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn its release, Thelma &amp; Louise was a commercial success and a critical one. Callie Khouri won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the film was nominated for five more: Best Director (Ridley Scott), Best Actress 1 (Geena Davis), Best Actress 2 (Susan Sarandon), Best Cinematography (Adria Biddle) and Best Editing (Thom Noble), as well as other prices at various Awards ceremonies and festivals. However, I fail to see why it wasn’t nominated for Best Picture.\n\nCallie Khouri with her Oscar for “Thelma and Louise.”Credit…Ron Galella, Ltd./WireImage, via Getty Images\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n***\n\nIf you still haven’t seen Thelma &amp; Louise, I urge you to do so. It’s a film to see once in a lifetime, AT THE VERY LEAST, for how powerful and beautiful it is. And well, since it’s not a too old classic, it’s not difficult to find.

I have to thank my mother for that. When I was a teenager, still living with my parents and a new cinephile, I used to go to that video renting store on Friday at the end of the school week where I rented new-to-me classics that I’d often watch with my mother and that she’ll discover along with me. <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Rebel Without a Cause</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Gone with the Wind</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Lawrence of Arabia</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>The Wild One</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Bonnie & Clyde</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, etc. were among those. But, as I said, <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> was a film my mother had seen before, and her recommendation was based on the fact that I had loved <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Bonnie & Clyde</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>. The story is different, but with the armed robbery and the overall road trip concept, there is a connection. My mother knew me well because I absolutely loved it, and it’s still a favourite today.</p>\n\n        <p>So, I think it was about time for me to discuss it. When Rob from MovieRob contacted his little crew to see if we were interested in participating in his Genre Grandeur, I thought I really should this time since I missed so many of those. The concept of what is also known as “GG” is simple. Each month, a blogger picked by Rob chooses a genre, and those who wish to participate write a review of a favourite film connected to that genre. The genre chosen can be broad. It’s not just drama or comedy as “genre” is used as a vast term. So, this month, we’re exploring films that feature and take place in desert areas. Paul of The People’s Movies chose the theme. And you see me coming. Because of its last act, I went with <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>. I could have taken <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Lawrence of Arabia</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> because I love that film, but I already reviewed it on my blog.</p>\n\n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> was directed by <director>Ridley Scott</director> (my favourite film of his) and released in <releaseYear>1991</releaseYear>. The screenplay is by <screenplay>Callie Khouri</screenplay> (the fact that it was written by a woman is very important to consider). The film stars <cast>\n            <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor>\n            <actor>Geena Davis</actor>\n            <actor>Harvey Keitel</actor>\n            <actor>Michael Madsen</actor>\n            <actor>Christophe McDonald</actor>\n            <actor>Brad Pitt</actor>\n            <actor>Timothy Carhart</actor>\n            <actor>Stephen Tobolowsky</actor>\n        </cast>.</p>\n\n        <p>Before going further with the film, I rarely do this, but that review will contain some spoilers, especially since the last act is crucial when discussing the desert landscapes of the film. I will try to indicate them as much as possible. So, if you haven’t seen it yet, you can skip those parts. But, to be honest, if you haven’t seen it, I don’t know what you are waiting for!</p>\n\n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> follows <protagonistType>two best friends</protagonistType> planning to go on a fishing trip in the mountains for the weekend. They both live pretty ordinary lives in Arkansas. <character>Thelma</character> is a housewife who has to bear with her insufferable husband, <character>Darryl</character> (Christopher McDonald), a carpet salesman who doesn’t care about his wife and expects her to be home all the time to prepare meals and clean. <character>Louise</character> is busy working as a waitress in a breakfast restaurant and dates <character>Jimmy Lennox</character> (Michael Madsen), a musician, but things seem complicated. Anyway, after an act of rebellion on <character>Thelma</character>’s behalf, aka not asking her husband’s permission to go on a trip with <character>Louise</character>, the two friends are on their way for some fun and to forget their boring daily life. On the road, they stop at a roadhouse bar for a pause and to have a drink. There’s a band playing country music, and people line dancing. It’s overall a pretty festive ambience. A man, <character>Harlan Puckett</character> (Timothy Carhart), spots <character>Thelma</character> and immediately starts flirting with her. The latter, now carefree and out of her trap, doesn’t seem to mind much, but <character>Louise</character> finds him dull and annoying. She doesn’t hesitate to blow her cigarette smoke in his face (and that’s honestly one of my favourite parts of the film). <character>Harlan</character> and <character>Thelma</character> end up dancing together and let’s say that <character>Harlan</character> doesn’t give <character>Thelma</character> much space. At some point, <character>Louise</character> goes to the bathroom and warns <character>Thelma</character> that they’ll be on their way after that.</p>\n\n        <p>Meanwhile, <character>Thelma</character>, who’s not feeling well after drinking lots of alcohol and spinning endlessly on the dance floor, says to <character>Harlan</character> that she has to go out for a breath of fresh air. He follows her and starts flirting with her in the parking lot and starts to be very tactile. <character>Thelma</character>, who’s not down for that anymore, asks him to stop. He instantly shows his true terrible nature and rapes her after slapping her face a few times. It is violent and always difficult to watch. He hasn’t heard <character>Louise</character> coming, and the latter points a gun at him and tells him to stop. As idiot as he is, he says something in the likes of “We were just having some fun”. To what <character>Louise</character> answers, her face and voice full of rage, “When a woman is crying like that, she is not having any fun!” <character>Harlan</character>, a disgusting rag, says he should have continued. <character>Louise</character>, full of hangers, ends up shooting him.</p>\n\n        <p>The two women drive off. <character>Thelma</character> suggests calling the police. <character>Louise</character>, who knows the justice system won’t play in their favour (and she’s right), prefers to run away. Therefore starts the wild escape of <character>Thelma</character> and <character>Louise</character>, full of danger and excitement. They are running for their life, in search of a better one, now that they can’t look back. On this transformative road trip, they will meet more men, such as the handsome <character>JD</character> (Brad Pitt), an ex-convict on parole. <character>Jimmy</character> will surprise <character>Louise</character> in a motel. <character>Thelma</character> will learn the art of armed robbery. Above all, they will stick together no matter what because that is how strong the power of friendship is. Detective <character>Hal Slocumb</character> (Harvey Keitel) is on the case, and he seems to be the only man who tries to understand the two ladies and doesn’t want anything bad to happen to them.</p>\n\n        <p>When Callie Khouri started developing the project in 1988, she was inspired by her own friendship with country singer Pam Tillis. And <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> is, first and foremost, a true ode to the strength of female bounds and friendship, a direct dive into a form of sisterhood where the connection surpasses the differences of character and contradicted personalities. <character>Thelma</character> and <character>Louise</character> are already established friends as the film begins. We don’t know for how long they’ve been friends. They are about in their mid-thirties, so they could have been friends since childhood or high school. Maybe something that simply clicked with them in recent years, a friendly love at first sight. On my side, I opt for the old friendship option. I feel like they could have become friends during high school, a time when friendships are deeply meaningful. I can perfectly picture <character>Louise</character> warning <character>Thelma</character> against marrying the stupid <character>Darryl</character>. I mean, where does this guy come from? He certainly doesn’t match <character>Thelma</character>’s sense of fun and repressed sense of adventure. In that sense, <character>Louise</character> acts as the elder sister figure in the duo. You feel she had more experience in life than <character>Thelma</character> and is here to protect her. Not just after the story’s catalyst but overall, making sure <character>Thelma</character> is alright. On her side, <character>Thelma</character> has so much to discover about life. In just a few days trip, she’ll live a lifetime, and her transformation is genuine. <character>Thelma</character> is the unlucky one of the story, especially with men who abuse her in many ways. <character>Louise</character> is a victim of that as well, but at least she has <character>Jimmy</character>, who overall seems to be an ok guy. You also feel that Detective <character>Slocumb</character> is on her side, knowing about her past history in Texas (a taboo subject for <character>Louise</character>) and acting as a compassionate figure although he is on the side of the law that the two ladies are running away from.</p>\n\n        <p>With this in mind, the road trip idea is of primary importance. It cements <character>Thelma</character> and <character>Louise</character>’s friendship but also provokes a noteworthy change of roles. <character>Louise</character>, who’s the leader and sort of has a “bad girl” aura in the sense that she works and isn’t married, eventually becomes the little sister guided by <character>Thelma</character>’s motivation and will to go on no matter what. This turn of situation, although gradual, is particularly noticeable when <spoiler>after a torrid night between <character>Thelma</character> and the sexy <character>JD</character> (Brad Pitt), the two friends discover that the latter, an imposter, has stolen the $6000 brought in person by <character>Jimmy</character> to help the girls. That is the last straw for <character>Louise</character>, who collapses and bursts into tears on the motel room floor, unable to see the end of their problems.</spoiler> <endSpoiler> <character>Thelma</character>, who so far had been the one having those reactions, knows she’s now the one who has to lead the pack. After clumsily telling <character>Louise</character> everything will be alright, she takes a firmer tone and orders her to get up and look forward instead of looking back. That’s how <character>Thelma</character> is now: someone who has to leave her regrets and bad memories in the past and always prefers to discover what the future is saving for her. If there are obstacles on the way, she’ll do everything to surpass them, even if it means doing a hold-up in a road convenience store in the middle of nowhere or locking a policeman in the trunk of his police car. She’s fearless. <character>Louise</character> now becomes the one who “follows”, and she knows they will both end in the same place. <character>Thelma</character>’s behaviour and style also change as the film progresses. She goes from being the proper lady, always well-groomed, to the one wearing jeans and t-shirts and smoking cigarettes, something she doesn’t seem to have done before. At this point, she and <character>Louise</character> know they have nothing to lose.</p>\n\n        <p>Although not the first choices, <actor>Geena Davis</actor> and <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor> were carefully selected to play the leading roles of <character>Thelma Dickinson</character> and <character>Louise Sawyer</character>. <actor>Geena Davis</actor>, already an Oscar in her pocket from <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>The Accidental Tourist</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, delivers another Oscar-nominated performance as the fascinating <character>Thelma</character>. She’s simply sparkling and someone who, despite all the difficulties her character goes through, perfectly embodies the sense of fun. On her side, <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor> was in the film industry since the early 70s and was seen in other cult movies like <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> and <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>The Hunger</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, already paving her way to exist in challenging films. Finding the right <character>Louise</character> took time, but, in the end, the final choice was the right one. <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor> perfectly embodies the maturity necessary for her character, as well as a woman with a traumatic past. One gaze, one twitch of the eye, is enough to embody her emotions. Although she lived difficult things, just like <character>Thelma</character>, she learns to look forward even though she’s conscious of the danger. <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor> was also nominated for an Oscar for her memorable performance.</p>\n\n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, aside from being a film about female friendship, depicts the injustices and inequalities women live in everyday life and with the justice system. In a way, <character>Harlan</character> is “executed” by <character>Louise</character> for the crime he committed. However, <character>Louise</character>, the executor, is now seen as a criminal even though she was defending her friend. <character>Thelma</character>’s first idea after the incident is to go to the police, which is a big no-no for <character>Louise</character>, who knows they don’t have any proof to incriminate <character>Harlan</character>. Problems like that have always happened and still happen to this day. In a way, it’s <character>Thelma</character> and <character>Louise</character>’s words against <character>Harlan</character>’s, except he’s now dead, so it becomes difficult to reach conclusions for someone who isn’t a witness. And when you think of it, we, the spectators, are witnesses but helpless ones. Troubles with men go on, which gives place to an interesting herd of male supporting actors, starting with <actor>Brad Pitt</actor> as <character>JD</character>. <actor>Pitt</actor> was still on his way to stardom when playing in the film. As <character>JD</character>, he knows perfectly how to play the charisma card (I mean, it’s <actor>Brad Pitt</actor>), but also how to act a bit idiot and docile to create the false aura of the good pitiful guy and, therefore, reach his means. So, once again, <character>Thelma</character> falls into a trap, and she and <character>Louise</character> face an extra obstacle. <character>Louise</character>’s guy, <character>Jimmy</character>, is portrayed by <actor>Michael Madsen</actor>, who, despite having some hanger in him and having difficulty understanding <character>Louise</character>, remains a decent person whose feelings for <character>Louise</character> are real. He doesn’t want to put any more obstacles in her already challenging situation. When he returns home after seeing <character>Louise</character>, he’s welcomed by the police, who are here to question him about <character>Louise</character>. We see his surprised reaction, but that’s the only interaction seen between him and the police. We have no idea if he told them where and when he saw his girlfriend. <spoiler>The police end up tracking the two women’s geographical position thanks to a phone call, and that’s how they eventually manage to find them.</spoiler></p>\n\n        <p>Although the interaction between <character>Jimmy</character> and the police has limited screen time, the situation is different with <character>Thelma</character>’s husband, <character>Darryl</character>, who has numerous interactions with the police, especially with Detective <character>Slocumb</character>. <actor>Christopher McDonald</actor> turns out to be the comic relief, although unintentional on <character>Darryl</character>’s part. I mean, you better take the guy seriously. So much so that he even makes the detective laugh when walking in his pizza that he left on the floor. That’s another one of my favourite moments in the film. <character>Darryl</character> likes to act as a very busy guy, but he’s just a spoiled teen <character>Thelma</character> has to look after. Interestingly, <actor>McDonald</actor> and <actor>Geena Davis</actor> were engaged in 1984, and he was thrilled to participate in this project with <actor>Davis</actor>. Maybe it was the right ingredient to play an “old couple” who can’t stand each other anymore, knowing they are trapped together. On his side, <actor>Harvey Keitel</actor> was already a well-established film figure after entering the 7th art during the “New Hollywood” Era, especially with Scorsese’s films like <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Mean Streets</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> and <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Taxi Driver</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>. His experience shows, and, aside from <actor>Geena Davis</actor> and <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor>, he’s the best actor in the cast. He tactfully expresses the complexity of his character by not being over the top and making sure he can be a trustworthy figure. It kind of half works, but the intentions are here. The only time we truly see him lose his temper is when he interrogates <character>JD</character>, knowing that the two ladies might be in even deeper problems because of him.</p>\n\n        <p>There are a lot of great performances by <actor>Keitel</actor>, but this one might be my favourite because of how sincere it is. One of my favourite acting moments in the film is brief and involves him and <actor>Susan Sarandon</actor>. <character>Louise</character> is talking to <character>Slocumb</character> on the phone. She doesn’t want to admit her defeat, especially because she’s scared of what might happen next if she gets caught. At the end of the call, the detective, full of compassion and with a touch of sadness in his voice, tells <character>Louise</character> he knows why she is running away and what happened to her in Texas. After that, <character>Louise</character>, tears of rage in her eyes, ends the conversation. Although <character>Slocumb</character> uses the verb “knows” in “I know why you’re running away”, his delivery translates it as “I understand”. I’ll let you watch the scene here:</p>\n\n        <p><movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, although telling a difficult story, transposes the latter on a gorgeous filming support. The various American landscapes are magnified for the screen by the masterful work of English cinematographer <cinematographer>Adrian Biddle</cinematographer>. He manages to give an indescribable aura to the different places we encounter. It adds to the transformations the ladies live. We see a lot of desolate spaces that seem to have no ends, that will never reach busy civilisation, just like the two friends have taken a road to nowhere. Through the camera work, we feel the heaviness of those places. <composer>Hans Zimmer</composer>’s soundtrack (my favourite composition by him) adds mysticism to these places and is often heard in decisive moments. The ladies find a <tone>joie de vivre</tone> when driving and singing along with the music playing on the car radio. Those are various popular songs, such as “The Way You Do the Things You Do” by The Temptations.</p>\n\n        <p>Before going further, take the time to listen to one of <composer>Hans Zimmer</composer>’s pieces for the film, “Thunderbird”, and appreciate all the melancholy it embodies:</p>\n\n        <p>The visual beauty of the film and the soundtrack reach a common culminant point to what we are mostly writing this review for: the desert. After seeing a lot of different places through Arkansas and New Mexico, the duo reaches the creme de la creme of American landscapes: the Grand Canyon, finding themselves at the heart of the semi-desert area of Arizona. It’s a landscape that is beyond them and certainly larger than life. However, the ending was not shot at the Grand Canyon but at Dead Horse Point State Park in Utah, an imposing and infinite desert landscape. We also see the iconic Monument Valley, often used in Westerns or road movies like <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>The Searchers</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> or <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Easy Rider</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>. Although the two ladies are running away for their lives and manage to challenge and surpass the many obstacles, their awe is well-transmitted when they finally reach these gorgeous but imposing sceneries. After a wild car chase with the police, they arrive next to the Grand Canyon’s precipice and can’t go further. If they turn back, they’ll get caught by the police with open arms. It’s windy and dry. They have sand all over their skins and hair and have reached the end of their possibilities. Or did they? <spoiler>Remember how <character>Thelma</character> and <character>Louise</character> always want to go further. Instead of turning themselves down to the police, they decide to go forward. “Let’s keep going!”, <character>Thelma</character> says to <character>Louise</character>. The latter asks, “What do you mean?” although she knows perfectly what she means. <character>Thelma</character> has made up her mind, and <character>Louise</character>, a true pal to the very end, goes along with her. So, after a kiss, hands in hands, they go full-spin towards the precipice, and the blue Ford Thunderbird flies over the Grand Canyon. It became one of the most iconic images in cinema history. The two ladies, knowing they couldn’t face what society has in reserve for them, preferred to keep the souvenir of each other in that poetic but brutal final decision.</spoiler></p>\n\n        <p>On its release, <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation> was a commercial success and a critical one. <screenplay>Callie Khouri</screenplay> won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the film was nominated for five more: Best Director (<director>Ridley Scott</director>), Best Actress 1 (<actor>Geena Davis</actor>), Best Actress 2 (<actor>Susan Sarandon</actor>), Best Cinematography (<cinematographer>Adrian Biddle</cinematographer>) and Best Editing (Thom Noble), as well as other prices at various Awards ceremonies and festivals. However, I fail to see why it wasn’t nominated for Best Picture.</p>\n\n        <p><screenplay>Callie Khouri</screenplay> with her Oscar for “<movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma and Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>.”</p>\n\n        <p>If you still haven’t seen <movieRecommendation>\n            <name>Thelma & Louise</name>\n        </movieRecommendation>, I urge you to do so. It’s a film to see once in a lifetime, AT THE VERY LEAST, for how powerful and beautiful it is. And well, since it’s not a too old classic, it’s not difficult to find. So, no excuses!</p>\n\n        <footer>Thanks to Rob for organizing Genre Grandeur and to Paul for choosing this creative theme!</footer>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the key attributes from the ADT are properly tagged.

It stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe in her first film appearance, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali.\n\nThe film presents three stages in the life of the main character: his childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. It explores the difficulties he faces with his homosexuality and identity as a black homosexual man, including the physical and emotional abuse he endures growing up.[4] Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by A24, receiving critical acclaim with praise towards its editing, cinematography, score, Jenkins's direction and screenplay, and handling of the themes of sexuality and masculinity. The performances of Harris and Ali also received widespread acclaim. It grossed over $65 million worldwide.\n\nMoonlight has been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century.[5][6][7][8][9][10] The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture—along with Best Supporting Actor (Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay—from a total of eight nominations, at the 89th Academy Awards. It was released as the first LGBTQ-themed mass-marketed feature film with an all-black cast and was, at the time of its release, the second-lowest-grossing film domestically (behind The Hurt Locker) to win the Oscar for Best Picture.[11][12][13] Joi McMillon became the first black woman to be nominated for an editing Oscar, and Mahershala Ali became the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar.[14][15]\n\n## Plot\n\n### I. Little\n\nIn Liberty City, Miami at the height of the crack epidemic, Afro-Cuban drug dealer Juan finds Chiron, a withdrawn child who goes by the nickname \"Little\", hiding from bullies in a crackhouse. Juan lets Chiron spend the night with him and his girlfriend Teresa before returning Chiron to his mother Paula. Chiron continues to spend time with Juan, who begins to teach him the basics of life, from which he believes Chiron can benefit.\n\nOne night, Juan encounters Paula smoking crack with one of his customers. Juan berates her for neglecting her son, but she rebukes him for selling crack to her in the first place. They argue over Chiron's upbringing; Paula asks if Juan is prepared to explain to Chiron why he gets tormented by his peers, alluding signs that he is gay. She goes home and takes out her frustration on Chiron.\n\nThe next day, Chiron admits to Juan and Teresa that he hates his mother and asks what a \"faggot\" is. Juan tells him it is \"a word used to make gay people feel bad.\" He tells Chiron there is nothing wrong with being gay and that he should not allow others to mock him. Chiron then asks Juan whether he sells drugs and whether his mother does drugs. After Juan remorsefully answers yes to both questions, Chiron leaves as Juan hangs his head in shame.\n\n### II. Chiron\n\nNow a teenager, Chiron balances avoiding school bully Terrel and spending time with Teresa, who lives alone after Juan's death. Paula, who has turned to prostitution due to her worsening addiction, forces Chiron to give her the money he receives from Teresa. Chiron's childhood friend Kevin tells him about a detention he received for having sex with a girl in a school stairwell. Chiron later dreams about Kevin and the girl having sex in Teresa's backyard, waking with a start. One night, Kevin visits Chiron at the beach near his house. While smoking a blunt together, the two discuss their ambitions and Kevin's nickname for Chiron: \"Black.\" They kiss, and Kevin gives Chiron a handjob.\n\nThe next day, Terrel manipulates Kevin into participating in a hazing ritual. Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until he cannot stand, watching as Terrel and other boys savagely attack him. When the principal urges him to reveal his attackers' identities, Chiron refuses, saying that reporting them will not solve anything. The next day, an enraged Chiron walks into class and smashes a chair over Terrel's head before being restrained. Chiron is arrested and taken from school in a police cruiser while Kevin watches.\n\n### III. Black\n\nA decade later, now going by \"Black\", an adult Chiron deals drugs in Atlanta and is an imposing figure in his community. He receives frequent calls from Paula, who asks him to visit her at the drug treatment center where she lives. One morning, Kevin unexpectedly calls and invites Chiron to see him should he ever come to Miami. Chiron visits Paula; though he is withdrawn, she apologizes for not loving him when he needed it most and says she loves him even if he does not love her back. The two tearfully reconcile.\n\nChiron drives to Miami to visit Kevin at the diner where he works as a cook. Kevin makes a meal for Chiron, who does not respond to questions about his life and how he has seemingly changed. Kevin shares that he had a son with an ex-girlfriend and, after getting out of prison, is fulfilled by his role as a father. Chiron reveals his unexpected drug dealing, which disappoints Kevin, and asks Kevin why he called. Kevin plays \"Hello Stranger\" by Barbara Lewis on the jukebox, the song that made him think of Chiron.\n\nThe two go to Kevin's apartment. Kevin tells Chiron that although his life did not turn out as he had hoped, he is happy, resulting in Chiron admitting that he has not been intimate with anybody since their encounter years ago. As Kevin comforts him, Chiron remembers himself as Little, standing on a beach in the moonlight.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Chiron (/ʃ aɪ ˈ r oʊ n / shy-ROHN ), the film's protagonist\n    - Alex R.

The theater piece was shelved for about a decade before it served as the basis for Moonlight.[16]\n\nAfter the release of his debut feature film Medicine for Melancholy in 2008, Barry Jenkins wrote various screenplays, none of which entered production.[17] In January 2013, producer Adele Romanski urged Jenkins to make a second film.[18] The two brainstormed a few times a month through video-chat, with the goal of producing a low-budget \"cinematic and personal\" film.[17] Jenkins was introduced to McCraney's play through the Borscht arts collective in Miami.[19] After discussions with McCraney, Jenkins wrote the first draft of the film in a month-long visit to Brussels.[17][19]\n\nAlthough the original play contained three parts, they ran simultaneously so that the audience would experience a day in the life of Little, Chiron and Black concurrently.[20] In fact, it is not made clear that the characters are the same person until halfway through the play.[21] Jenkins instead chose to split the three parts of the original piece into distinct chapters and to focus on Chiron's story from the perspective of an ally.[19][22]\n\nThe result was a screenplay that reflected the similar upbringings of Jenkins and McCraney. The character Juan was based on the father of McCraney's half-brother, who was also a childhood \"defender\" of McCraney, as Juan was for Chiron.[23] Likewise, Paula was a depiction of Jenkins' and McCraney's mothers, who both were drug addicts. McCraney and Jenkins also both grew up in Miami's Liberty Square, a primary location of the film.[18]\n\nJenkins looked for financing for the film during 2013, finding success after showing the script to the executives of Plan B Entertainment at the year's Telluride Film Festival. Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner of Plan B Entertainment became producers of the film,[17] while A24 undertook to finance it and handle worldwide distribution, which marked the company's first production.[24]\n\n### Casting\n\nScreenwriter and director Barry Jenkins\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDifferent actors portrayed Chiron and Kevin in each chapter of the film. Ashton Sanders was cast in the role of teen Chiron.[25] Alex Hibbert and Jaden Piner were cast for the roles of child Chiron and child Kevin, respectively, in an open casting call in Miami.[26][27] Trevante Rhodes originally auditioned for the role of Kevin, before he was cast as adult Chiron.[28]\n\nAndré Holland had previously acted in McCraney's plays, and had read In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue a decade before the release of the film.[29] Holland was attracted to the role of adult Kevin when later reading the script of the film, stating, \"[The script] was the best thing I've ever read\".[30]\n\nNaomie Harris was initially reluctant to portray Paula, stating that she did not want to play a stereotypical depiction of a black woman.[31] When addressing her concerns, Jenkins emphasized the character's representation of both his and McCraney's mothers.[29] Harris later commented that although she had previously vowed not to portray a crack addict, the film's script and director's tolerance appealed to her.[18] In preparation for her role, Harris watched interviews of those with addiction to crack cocaine, and met with addicted women. She related her experiences of bullying to the addicts' attempts of escaping trauma.[31][32]\n\nRomanski proposed Juan be played by Mahershala Ali, who had a role in one of her previously produced films, Kicks. Jenkins was hesitant when casting Ali due to his role as Remy Danton in House of Cards; however, he was convinced after witnessing Ali's acting range and understanding of his character.[33] Ali considered the role an important opportunity to portray an African-American male mentor,[34] and drew on his experiences of \"[growing] up with a Juan\".[33] Janelle Monáe was sent the script and immediately connected to her role as Teresa, commenting that she too had family members with similar struggles relating to drugs and sexual identity.[17]\n\n### Filming\n\nPart of the film was shot in the Liberty Square housing project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFilming began on October 14, 2015, in Miami, Florida.[26][35] Despite Florida not having tax incentives for film productions, Moonlight was able to shoot in Florida at the insistence of the film's creative team and with support from its financiers. Had the production relocated to a different state with legislative incentives, the film's budget may have provided more resources by as much as up to 30%. The decision to film in Florida was made to maintain authenticity as a Florida based story.[36]\n\nAfter scouting for locations in Miami with Romanski,[22] Jenkins made an effort to film in locations where he previously lived. Liberty Square, a housing project located in the neighborhood of Liberty City, was chosen as one of the primary locations as both McCraney and Jenkins grew up in the area.[37][38] The film was shot undisturbed since Jenkins had relatives living in the area,[22] though the cast and crew had police escorts.[32] Naomie Harris later reflected:\n\nIt was the first time someone had come to their community and wanted to represent it onscreen, and since Barry Jenkins had grown up in that area, there was this sense of pride and this desire to support him. You felt this love from the community that I've never felt in any other location, anywhere in the world, and it was so strange that it happened in a place where people were expecting the complete opposite.[32]\n\nDuring filming, Jenkins made sure that the three actors for Chiron did not meet each other until after filming to avoid any imitations of one another.[39] Consequently, Rhodes, Sanders, and Hibbert filmed in separate two-week periods.[38] Mahershala Ali frequently flew to Miami on consecutive weekends to film during the production of other projects.[40][41][42] Naomie Harris shot all of her scenes in three days without rehearsals,[31][32][42] while André Holland filmed the totality of his scenes in five.[42] The film was shot in a period of twenty-five days.[16]\n\nJenkins worked with cinematographer and longtime friend James Laxton, who previously shot Medicine for Melancholy.[43] The two chose to avoid the \"documentary look\" and thus shot the film using widescreen CinemaScope on an Arri Alexa digital camera, which better rendered skin tone.[40][43] With colorist Alex Bickel, they further achieved this by creating a color grade that increased the contrast and saturation while preserving the detail and color. As a result, the three chapters of the film were designed to imitate different film stocks. The first chapter emulated the Fuji film stock to intensify the cast's skin tones. The second chapter imitated the Agfa film stock, which added cyan to the images, while the third chapter used a modified Kodak film stock.[44]\n\n### Editing\n\nPost production began in November 2015 and was completed in April 2016.[45] The film was edited in Los Angeles[40] by Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders, former university schoolmates of Jenkins.[43] Sanders was responsible for editing the first and second chapters.[46] McMillon was responsible for the third act which included the \"diner scene\", a favorite of the cinematographer Laxton.[47][48]\n\nMcMillion and Sanders worked in the same room during editing sessions, and were able to exchange notes and provide feedback to one another throughout post production. Because the film did not need to be ready for any film festival or premiere deadlines, they were able to take ample time in post production. Jenkins was usually present during editing sessions. In McMillion's words, \"At certain points Barry and Nat would be working on a section of the film and then say 'Hey Joi turn around and look at this\" and then vice versa; when Barry was working with me he'd say, 'Hey Nat, how do you feel about this?'\".[45]\n\nSanders and McMillion made several changes from the script, the most notable being the scene in the third act where Chiron visits his mother. This was meant to be one of the first scenes in the third act, but the editors convinced Jenkins to move it later in the story.[49]\n\nMcMillion became the first African-American woman to be nominated for an editing Oscar for her work on the film.[50] She remains the only African-American woman to be nominated in the category.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score of Moonlight was composed by Nicholas Britell, who applied the chopped and screwed technique from hip hop remixes to orchestral music, producing a \"fluid, bass-heavy score\". The soundtrack, released on October 21, 2016, consists of eighteen original cues by Britell along with others by Goodie Mob, Boris Gardiner, and Barbara Lewis.[51] A chopped and screwed version was released by OG Ron C and DJ Candlestick of The Chopstars.[52]\n\n## Themes\n\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian, lists \"love, sex, survival, mothers and father figures\" among its themes, particularly the lack of a nurturing father.[53] However, A. O. Scott of The New York Times cites the character Juan as an example of how the film \"evokes clichés of African-American masculinity in order to shatter them.\"[54] In his review in Variety, Peter Debruge suggests that the film demonstrates that the African American identity is more complex than has been portrayed in films of the past.[55] For example, while Juan plays the role of Little's defender and protector, he is also part of the root cause of at least some of the hardship the young boy endures.[56]\n\nA major theme of Moonlight is the black male identity and its interactions with sexual identity. The film takes a form similar to a triptych in order to explore the path of a man from a neglected childhood, through an angry adolescence, to self-realization and fulfillment in adulthood.[53]\n\nThis particular story of Chiron's sexuality is also seen as a story of race in a 'post-Obama' era. The film amalgamates art film with hood film in its portrayal of African-American characters on-screen. Many technical film techniques are employed to juxtapose the characters and action on scene, including the use of an orchestral score done in the melody of popular R&amp;B and hip-hop motifs. This specifically deals with the theme of recuperating identity, especially in terms of blackness.\nThe characters operate in an urban working-class city in Florida\nbut are portrayed through art house conventions to create a new space for black characters in cinema.\nThis mirrors Chiron's own odyssey to learning who he is, as he constantly struggles with trying to find some essentialism to his identity, yet consistently fails in doing so. The triptych structure helps to reiterate the fragmented personality to the film and Chiron.[57]\n\n### Black masculinity\n\nThe film's co-writer, Tarell Alvin McCraney, speaks on the topic of black masculinity in the film, explaining why Chiron went to such lengths to alter his persona. He argues that communities without privilege or power seek to gain it in other ways. He says one way males in such communities do this is by trying to enhance their masculine identity, knowing that it often provides a means to more social control in a patriarchal society.[58]\n\nMasculinity is portrayed as rigid and aggressive throughout the film, apparent in the behavior displayed by the young black men in Chiron's teenage peer group.[59] The expression of hyper-masculinity among black men has been associated with peer acceptance and community.[60] Being a homosexual within the black community, on the other hand, has been associated with social alienation and homophobic judgement by peers because black gay men are seen as weak or effeminate. In the film, Chiron is placed in this divide as a black gay man and alters his presentation of masculinity as a strategy to avoid ridicule because homosexuality is viewed as incompatible with black masculine expectations. As young kids, Kevin hides his sexuality in order to avoid being singled out like Chiron is. As Chiron grows older, he recognizes the need to conform to a heteronormative ideal of black masculinity in order to avoid abuse and homophobia. As an adult, Chiron chooses to embrace the stereotypical black male gender performance by becoming muscular and a drug dealer.[59]\n\nMoonlight explores the effects of this felt powerlessness in black males. As McCraney explains, coping with this feeling often coincides with attempts to overstate one's masculinity, in a way that can easily become toxic. He says one unfortunate side effect of leaning into masculinity too much is that men no longer want to be \"caressed, or nurtured, or gentle\", which is why a character like Juan may be puzzling to some audiences.[58]\n\n### Intersection of blackness, masculinity, and vulnerability\n\nBlackness, masculinity, and vulnerability are major focuses of this film.[61] In the beach scene with Chiron, Juan, his father figure in the film, emphasizes the importance of black identity. Juan says, \"There are black people everywhere. Remember that, okay? No place you can go in the world ain't got no black people. We was the first on this planet.\" As Juan speaks about the relevance and importance of the black experience, he also thinks about a time in his youth when a stranger told him \"in moonlight, black boys look blue.\" This is an image that the audience gets to see as the director, Barry Jenkins, supplies numerous shots of Chiron in the moonlight. It seems that Juan seems to associate this image with vulnerability, given that he tells Chiron that he eventually shed the nickname \"Blue\" in order to foster his own identity. The scenes depicting Chiron in the moonlight are almost always the ones in which he's vulnerable, his intimate night on the beach with Kevin included. Throughout the film, this dichotomy between black and blue stands in for that between tough and vulnerable, with the black body often hovering between the two.[62] In Chiron's situation, the black body, which can be seen as inherently vulnerable in American society, must be tough in order to survive, as seen by Chiron's final, very masculine and dominant identity.\n\n## Release\n\nJenkins, Holland, and Sanders in Toronto\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016.[63] It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2016,[64][65] the New York Film Festival on October 2, 2016,[66][67] the BFI London Film Festival on October 6, 2016[68] and the Vancouver International Film Festival on October 7, 2016.[69] The film was released to select theaters on October 21, 2016,[70] before beginning a wide release on November 18, 2016.[71][72] The full UK cinema release was on February 17, 2017.[73]\n\nAs part of a partnership between A24 and IMAX, the film will be re-released in IMAX theaters on February 26, 2025.[74]\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe film's poster reflects its triptych structure, combining the three actors portraying Chiron into a single face.[75] The trailer for the film was released on August 11, 2016, in time for festival season. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times referred to it \"as one of the most anticipated films for fall\".[76]\n\nOn February 27, 2017, the day after the Academy Awards, Calvin Klein released an underwear advertising campaign featuring four of the male actors in the film.[77] On March 7, 2017, Beijing-based streaming video service iQiyi announced that it has acquired the rights to stream the film in China.[78] The film is also available in home media format through iTunes and DVD.[79]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nMoonlight grossed $27.9 million in the United States and Canada and $37.5 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $65.3 million, against a production budget of $1.5 million.[3]\n\nThe film originally played in four theaters in its limited October 21, 2016, release, grossing $402,072 (a per-theater average $100,519).[80] The film's theater count peaked at 650 in its wide opening on November 18, 2016, before expanding to 1,014 theaters in February. After the Oscars ceremony, A24 announced that the film would be played at 1,564 theaters.[79] In the weekend following its Oscar wins the film grossed $2.5 million, up 260% from its previous week and marking the highest-grossing weekend of its entire theatrical release. It was also a higher gross than the previous two Best Picture winners, Spotlight ($1.8 million) and Birdman ($1.9 million), had in their first weekend following the Academy Awards.[81]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 402 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Moonlight uses one man's story to offer a remarkable and brilliantly crafted look at lives too rarely seen in cinema.\"[82] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 99 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[83] On both websites, it was the highest-scoring film released in 2016.[84][85]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performances of  and  were critically acclaimed and nominated for , with Ali winning.\n\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a positive review after Moonlight premiered at the 2016 Telluride Film Festival. He praised the actors' performances and described the cinematography of James Laxton as \"fluid and seductive, deceptively mellow, and shot through with searing compassion\". Rooney concluded that the film \"will strike plangent chords for anyone who has ever struggled with identity, or to find connections in a lonely world\".[86] In a uniformly positive review for Time Out New York, Joshua Rothkopf gave Moonlight five stars out of five and praised Barry Jenkins's direction.[87]\n\nBrian Formo of Collider gave Moonlight an 'A−' grade rating, applauding the performances and direction but contending that the film \"is more personal and important than it is great\".[88] Similarly, Jake Cole of Slant Magazine praised the acting, but criticized the screenplay, and argued that \"so much of the film feels old-hat\".[89] In a review for The Verge, Tasha Robinson lamented the plot details omitted between the film's three acts, but wrote that \"what does make it to the screen is unforgettable\".[90]\n\nWhile discussing the film after its screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described Moonlight as \"achingly romantic and uncommonly wise\", and an early Oscar contender. Chang further wrote: \"[Barry Jenkins] made a film that urges the viewer to look past Chiron's outward appearance and his superficial signifiers of identity, climbing inside familiar stereotypes in order to quietly dismantle them from within ... [Moonlight] doesn't say much. It says everything\".[91]\n\nWriting for The London Review of Books in February 2017, Michael Wood characterized the film as a study of an inherited intergenerational tragedy:\n\n[By the end of the film] there are still ten minutes of late Ingmar Bergman to go. The film keeps showing us Chiron's handsome, inscrutable face. The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us to feel sorry for him ... All is not lost, though, because as we gaze at Chiron, we can think of something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron ... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach ... looking out at the ocean ... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?[92]\n\nCamilla Long of The Times wrote that the film's \"story has been told countless times, against countless backdrops\", and that the film is not \"relevant\" to a predominantly \"straight, white, middle class\" audience.[93] Catherine Shoard, however, pointed out that \"critics' opinions are subjective, and are supposed to be\", but also noted her dismay for Long's \"struggle to feel for those who aren't like you.\"[94] Moreover, David McAlmont of The Huffington Post referred to Long's review as \"not a review ... [but] a waspish response to other reviews.\"[95]\n\nRichard Brody of The New Yorker included Moonlight in his list of the best 27 films of the decade.[96]\n\nMany filmmakers praised the film, including Mike Birbiglia, Gia Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Jay Duplass, Ezra Edelman, Hannah Fidell, Andrew Haigh, Alma Har'el, Chad Hartigan, Marielle Heller, Anna Rose Holmer, Nicole Holofcener, Chris Kelly, Karyn Kusama, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, David Lowery, Rebecca Miller, Reed Morano, Oren Moverman, James Ponsoldt, Josh Safdie and Dash Shaw.[97]\n\nOn a list of the top ten lists of the decade on Metacritic, it was tied for the second-most number ones and ranked second in overall mentions on lists of the top ten films of the decade.[98]\n\nMoonlight was listed on over 180 critics' top-ten lists for 2016, including 65 first-place rankings and 33 second-place rankings.[99]\n\nIndieWire writers ranked Moonlight as the 16th best American screenplay of the 21st century, stating that Jenkins and McCraney \"dig deep into three brief moments and ask the audience to make connections [...] the bold and risky choices of the Moonlight screenplay pay off in ways that make this masterpiece only improve with time and repeat viewings.\"[100]\n\n### Top ten lists\n\nMoonlight was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists.[101]\n\n- 1st – A.O.

Co-presenter Warren Beatty subsequently stated that he had been mistakenly given the duplicate envelope for the Best Actress award, which Emma Stone had won for her role in La La Land several minutes earlier.[107] When the mistake was realized, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz came forward to announce Moonlight as the actual winner.[108] The Best Picture envelope is on display at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles. Beatty wrote a congratulatory note to Jenkins, which is also on display at the Academy Museum.[109]\n\nDuring his keynote presentation at the 2018 SXSW Festival, Jenkins read the acceptance speech he had prepared in the event of Moonlight winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards. He had been unable to deliver the intended speech at the ceremony due to the confusion over La La Land being mistakenly announced as the winner.[110]\n\nBecause the film's screenplay was based on a play that had not been previously produced or published, different awards had different rules as to whether Moonlight qualified in the original or adapted screenplay categories.[111] It was classified as an original screenplay by both the Writers Guild of America Awards and the BAFTAs, but was ruled an adapted screenplay according to Academy Award rules.[111]\n\nNat Sanders and Joi McMillon were nominated for Best Film Editing, making McMillon the first black woman to earn an Academy Award nomination in film editing.[112] It is also the first LGBTQ film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards.[113]\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nThe film is referenced in \"Moonlight\", a song from Jay-Z's 2017 studio album 4:44.[114] In the closing of The Simpsons episode \"Haw-Haw Land\" it is stated that the episode was supposed to be a parody of the film rather than La La Land (itself parodying the mistake at the 89th Academy Awards.[115])\n\n## See also\n\n- List of LGBT-related films\n- List of hood films\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Moonlight\".

                "Summary": "Taxi Driver is a 1976 American neo-noir psychological drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader. Set in a morally decaying New York City following the Vietnam War, it stars Robert De Niro as veteran Marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle, whose mental state deteriorates as he works nights in the city. The film also stars Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks in his first film role.",
                "Production": "With The Wrong Man (1956) and A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences. Filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed for the film what would be his final score; the music was finished just hours before his death, and the film is dedicated to him.",
                "Release": "Theatrically released by Columbia Pictures on February 8, 1976, the film was critically and commercially successful despite generating controversy both for its graphic violence in the climactic ending and for the casting of then 12-year-old Foster as a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for De Niro), and Best Supporting Actress (for Foster).",
                "Controversies": "Although Taxi Driver generated further controversy for inspiring John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the film has remained popular. It is considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time, garnering cult status. In 2022, Sight & Sound named it the 29th-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, and the 12th-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll, tied with Barry Lyndon. In 1994, the film was considered 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically' significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.",
                "Plot": "In New York City, Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequenting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms such as 'you're only as healthy as you feel.' He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses in the city and dreams about getting 'the scum off the streets.'",

It's not for everyone due to its extreme graphic (if quite over the top) violence and frenetic filming style, but I find it's a brilliant satire that rings more true than ever these days with its commentary and ultimately condemnation on the media's irresponsible habit of glorifying murderers and making them into celebrities. It was something timely and relevant even at the time it was made thanks to tabloid journalism, and it eerily feels more so now thanks to social media and how anyone can be a celebrity and have a following no matter what a terrible person they are."

                "description": "Moonlight is a 2016 American coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Barry Jenkins, based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unpublished semi-autobiographical play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. It stars Trevante Rhodes, André Holland, Janelle Monáe in her first film appearance, Ashton Sanders, Jharrel Jerome, Naomie Harris, and Mahershala Ali. The film presents three stages in the life of the main character: his childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. It explores the difficulties he faces with his homosexuality and identity as a black homosexual man, including the physical and emotional abuse he endures growing up. Filmed in Miami, Florida, beginning in 2015, Moonlight premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United States on October 21, 2016, by A24, receiving critical acclaim with praise towards its editing, cinematography, score, Jenkins's direction and screenplay, and handling of the themes of sexuality and masculinity. Moonlight has been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture—along with Best Supporting Actor (Ali) and Best Adapted Screenplay—from a total of eight nominations, at the 89th Academy Awards."
