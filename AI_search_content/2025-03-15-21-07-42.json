While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998) , on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.Nolan's second film was Memento (2000) , which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan . Starring Guy Pearce , the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia (2002) , starring Al Pacino , Robin Williams and Hilary Swank .The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005) , Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006) , starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008) .

Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations. The film is widely considered one of the best comic book adaptations of all times, with Heath Ledger 's performance as the Joker receiving an extremely high acclaim. Ledger posthumously became the first Academy Award winning performance in a Nolan film.In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the Sci-Fi thriller Inception (2010) , starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay that he worked on for almost a decade. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year, and of all times. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with a W.G.A. Award accolade, as well as D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards nominations for his work on the film.As one of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy.

In 2020 he released his mind-bending Sci-Fi espionage thriller Tenet (2020) starring John David Washington in the lead role. Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie grossed relatively less than Nolan's previous blockbusters, though it did do good numbers compared to other movies in that period of time. Hailed as Nolan's most complex film yet, the film was one of Nolan's less-acclaimed films at the time, yet slowly built a fan-base following in later years.In July 2023, Nolan released his highly acclaimed biographic drama Oppenheimer (2023) starring Nolan's frequent collaborator Cillian Murphy - in the lead role for the first time in a Nolan film. The movie was a cultural phenomenon that on top of grossing almost 1 billion dollars at the Worldwide Box office, also swept the 2023/2024 award-season and gave Nolan his first Oscars, BAFTAs, Golden Globes, D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards, as well as a handful of regional critics-circles awards and a W.G.A. nomination. Cillian's performance as quantum physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was highly acclaimed as well, and became the first lead performance in a Nolan film to win the Academy Award.During 2023, Nolan also received a fellowship from the British Film Institute (BFI).

The final film was initially judgedto be almost unreleasable weird, but thanks to the efforts ofdistributor Ben Barenholtz , it secured acult following and enabled Lynch to make his first mainstream film (inan unlikely alliance withMel Brooks ), thoughThe Elephant Man (1980) was shotthrough with his unique sensibility. Its enormous critical andcommercial success led to Dune (1984) , ahugely expensive commercial disaster, but Lynch redeemed himself withthe now classic Blue Velvet (1986) ,his most personal and original work since his debut.

Roman Polanski Chinatown (1974) Roman Polanski is a Polish film director, producer, writer and actor.Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA, he isconsidered one of the few truly international filmmakers.Roman Polanski was born in Paris in 1933.His parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began.On Germany's invasion in 1939, as a family of mostly Jewish heritage, they were allsent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent totwo different concentration camps:His father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria, where he survived the war, and his mother to Auschwitz whereshe was murdered. Roman witnessed his father's capture and then, at only 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war, at firstwandering through the Polish countryside and pretending to be a Roman-Catholic kid visiting his relatives.Although this saved his life, he was severely mistreated suffering nearly fatal beating whichleft him with a fractured skull.Local people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed littleconcerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed, Poland became increasingly war-torn and he lived his life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find.Still under 12 years old, he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war'send in 1945, he reunited with his father who sent him to a technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen anothercareer.In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda 's Pokolenie (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School.His early shorts such as Dwaj ludzie z szafa (1958) , Le gros et le maigre (1961) and Ssaki (1962) , showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships.His feature debut, Knife in the Water (1962) , was one of the first Polish post-war films not associated with the war theme.It was also the first movie from Poland to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film.Though already a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France.While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, Gérard Brach , who eventually became his long-time collaborator.The next two films, Repulsion (1965) and Cul-de-sac (1966) , made in England and co-written by Brach, won respectively Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin International Film Festival.In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, Rosemary's Baby (1968) . However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate , by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Chinatown (1974) .It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the sodomy of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from he USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979) , which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films.It wasn't until The Pianist (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. For that movie, he won nearly all the most important film awards, including the Oscar for Best Director, Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, the BAFTA and Cesar Award.He still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results, as in Una pura formalità (1994) .

Brian De Palma Body Double (1984) Brian De Palma is one of the well-known directors who spear-headed the new movement in Hollywood during the 1970s. He is known for his many films that go from violent pictures, to Hitchcock-like thrillers. Born on September 11, 1940, De Palma was born in Newark, New Jersey in an Italian-American family. Originally entering university as a physics student, De Palma became attracted to films after seeing such classics as Citizen Kane (1941) . Enrolling in Sarah Lawrence College, he found lasting influences from such varied teachers as Alfred Hitchcock and Andy Warhol .At first, his films comprised of such black-and-white films as To Bridge This Gap (1969) . He then discovered a young actor whose fame would influence Hollywood forever. In 1968, De Palma made the comedic film Greetings (1968) starring Robert De Niro in his first ever credited film role. The two followed up immediately with the films The Wedding Party (1969) and Hi, Mom! (1970) .After making such small-budget thrillers such as Sisters (1972) and Obsession (1976) , De Palma was offered the chance to direct a film based on Stephen King 's classic novel \"Carrie\". The story deals with a tormented teenage girl who finds she has the power of telekinesis. The film starred Sissy Spacek , Piper Laurie and John Travolta , and was for De Palma, a chance to try out the split screen technique for which he would later become famous.Carrie (1976) was a massive success, and earned the two lead females (Laurie and Spacek) Oscar nominations. The film was praised by most critics, and De Palma's reputation was now permanently secured. He followed up this success with the horror film The Fury (1978) , the comedic film Home Movies (1979) (both these films featured Kirk Douglas ), the crime thriller Dressed to Kill (1980) starring Michael Caine and Angie Dickinson , and another crime thriller entitled Blow Out (1981) starring John Travolta .His next major success was the controversial, ultra-violent film Scarface (1983) . Written by Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino , the film concerned Cuban immigrant Tony Montana's rise to power in the United States through the drug trade. While being a critical failure, the film was a major success commercially.Moving on from Scarface (1983) , De Palma made two more movies before landing another one of his now-classics: The Untouchables (1987) , starring old friend Robert De Niro in the role of Chicago gangster Al Capone. Also starring in the film were Kevin Costner as the man who commits himself to bring Capone down, and Sean Connery , an old policeman who helps Costner's character to form a group known as the Untouchables. The film was one of De Palma's most successful films, earning Connery an Oscar, and gave Ennio Morricone a nomination for Best Score.After The Untouchables (1987) , De Palma made the Vietnam film Casualties of War (1989) starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn . The film focuses on a new soldier who is helpless to stop his dominating sergeant from kidnapping a Vietnamese girl with the help of the coerced members of the platoon. The film did reasonably well at the box office, but it was his next film that truly displayed the way he could make a hit and a disaster within a short time. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) starred a number of well-known actors such as Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman , however it was still a commercial flop and earned him two Razzie nominations.But the roller coaster success that De Palma had gotten so far did not let him down. He made the horror film Raising Cain (1992) , and the criminal drama Carlito's Way (1993) starring Al Pacino and Sean Penn . The latter film is about a former criminal just released from prison that is trying to avoid his past and move on. It was in the year 1996 that brought one of his most well-known movies. This was the suspense-filled Mission: Impossible (1996) starring Tom Cruise and Jon Voight .Following up this film was the interesting but unsuccessful film Snake Eyes (1998) starring Nicolas Cage as a detective who finds himself in the middle of a murder scene at a boxing ring. De Palma continued on with the visually astounding but equally unsuccessful film Mission to Mars (2000) which earned him another Razzie nomination. He met failure again with the crime thriller Femme Fatale (2002) , the murder conspiracy The Black Dahlia (2006) , and the controversial film Redacted (2007) which deals with individual stories from the war in Iraq.Brian De Palma may be down for the moment, but if his box office history has taught us anything, it is that he always returns with amajor success that is remembered for years and years afterwards.

Sidney Lumet 12 Angry Men (1957) Sidney Lumet was a master of cinema, best known for his technicalknowledge and his skill at getting first-rate performances from hisactors -- and for shooting most of his films in his beloved New York.He made over 40 movies, often complex and emotional, but seldom overlysentimental. Although his politics were somewhat left-leaning and heoften treated socially relevant themes in his films, Lumet didn't wantto make political movies in the first place. Born on June 25, 1924, inPhiladelphia, the son of actor Baruch Lumet and dancer Eugenia Wermus Lumet, he made his stage debut at age four atthe Yiddish Art Theater in New York. He played many roles on Broadwayin the 1930s and also in the film...One Third of a Nation... (1939) .After starting an off-Broadway acting troupe in the late 1940s, hebecame the director of many television shows in the 1950s. Lumet madehis feature film directing debut with12 Angry Men (1957) , which won theGolden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and earned three Academy Awardnominations. The courtroom drama, which takes place almost entirely ina jury room, is justly regarded as one of the most auspiciousdirectorial debuts in film history. Lumet got the chance to directMarlon Brando inThe Fugitive Kind (1960) , animperfect, but powerful adaptation ofTennessee Williams ' \"OrpheusDescending\". The first half of the 1960s was one of Lumet's mostartistically successful periods.Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962) ,a masterful, brilliantly photographed adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play, is one of several Lumet films about families. It earnedKatharine Hepburn ,Ralph Richardson ,Dean Stockwell andJason Robards deserved acting awards inCannes and Hepburn an Oscar nomination. The alarming Cold War thrillerFail Safe (1964) unfairly suffered fromcomparison to Stanley Kubrick 'sequally great satireDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) ,which was released shortly before.The Pawnbroker (1964) , arguablythe most outstanding of the great movies Lumet made in this phase,tells the story of a Holocaust survivor who lives in New York and can'tovercome his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps.Rod Steiger 's unforgettable performance inthe title role earned an Academy Award nomination. Lumet's intensecharacter study The Hill (1965) aboutinhumanity in a military prison camp was the first of five films he didwith Sean Connery . After the overly talkybut rewarding drama The Group (1966) about young upper-class women in the 1930s, and the stylish spythrillerThe Deadly Affair (1967) , thelate 1960s turned out to be a lesser phase in Lumet's career. He had astrong comeback with the box-office hitThe Anderson Tapes (1971) .The Offence (1973) was commerciallyless successful, but artistically brilliant - with Connery in one ofhis most impressive performances. The terrific cop thrillerSerpico (1973) , the first of his filmsabout police corruption in New York City, became one of his biggestcritical and financial successes. Al Pacino 'sfascinating portrayal of the real-life cop Frank Serpico earned aGolden Globe and the movie earned two Academy Award nominations (it isworth noting that Lumet's feature films of the 1970s alone earned 30Oscar nominations, winning six times). The love triangleLovin' Molly (1974) was not alwaysconvincing in its atmospheric details, but Lumet's fine sense ofemotional truth and a good Blythe Danner keep it interesting. The adaptation ofAgatha Christie 'sMurder on the Orient Express (1974) ,an exquisitely photographed murder mystery with an all-star cast, was abig success again. Lumet's complex crime thrillerDog Day Afternoon (1975) , whichPauline Kael called \"one of the best \"NewYork\" movies ever made\", gave Al Pacino theopportunity for a breathtaking, three-dimensional portrayal of abisexual man who tries to rob a bank to finance his lover's sex-changeoperation. Lumet's next masterpiece,Network (1976) , was a prophetic satire onmedia and society. The film version ofPeter Shaffer 's stage playEquus (1977) about a doctor and hismentally confused patient was also powerful, not least because of theenergetic acting byRichard Burton andPeter Firth . After the enjoyablemusical The Wiz (1978) and theinteresting but not easily accessible comedyJust Tell Me What You Want (1980) ,Sidney Lumet won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for hisoutstanding direction ofPrince of the City (1981) , oneof his best and most typical films. It's about police corruption, buthardly a remake of Serpico (1973) .Starring a powerful Treat Williams , it'san extraordinarily multi-layered film. In his highly informative book\"Making Movies\" (1995), Lumet describes the film in the following way:\"When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us.Nothing is what it seems.\" It's also a movie about values, friendshipand drug addiction and, like \"Serpico\", is based on a true story. InDeathtrap (1982) , Lumet successfullyblended suspense and black humor.The Verdict (1982) was voted thefourth greatest courtroom drama of all time by the American FilmInstitute in 2008. A few minor inaccuracies in legal details do not marthis study of an alcoholic lawyer (superbly embodied byPaul Newman ) aiming to regain hisself-respect through a malpractice case. The expertly directed moviereceived five Academy Award nominations. Lumet's controversial dramaDaniel (1983) withTimothy Hutton , an adaptation ofE.L. Doctorow 's \"The Book of Daniel\" abouttwo young people whose parents were executed during the McCarthy RedScare hysteria in the 1950s for alleged espionage, is one of hisunderrated achievements. His later masterpieceRunning on Empty (1988) has asimilar theme, portraying a family which has been on the run from theFBI since the parents (played byChristine Lahti andJudd Hirsch ) committed a bomb attack on anapalm laboratory in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam. The son(played by River Phoenix in anextraordinarily moving, Oscar-nominated performance) falls in love witha girl and wishes to stay with her and study music.Naomi Foner 's screenplay won the GoldenGlobe. Other Lumet movies of the 1980s are the melancholic comedy dramaGarbo Talks (1984) ; the occasionallyclichéd Power (1986) about electioncampaigns; the all too slow thrillerThe Morning After (1986) andthe amusing gangster comedyFamily Business (1989) . WithQ &amp;amp; A (1990) Lumet returned to the genre ofthe New York cop thriller. Nick Nolte shinesin the role of a corrupt and racist detective in this multi-layered,strangely underrated film. Sadly, with the exception ofNight Falls on Manhattan (1996) ,an imperfect but fascinating crime drama in the tradition of his ownprevious genre works, almost none of Lumet's works of the 1990s didquite get the attention they deserved. The crime dramaClose to Eden (1992) blended genres in a way that did not seem to match most viewers'expectations, but its contemplations about life arouse interest. Theintelligent hospital satireCritical Care (1997) was unfairlyneglected as well. The courtroom thrillerGuilty as Sin (1993) was cold butintriguing. Lumet's Gloria (1999) remakeseemed unnecessary, but he returned impressively with theunderestimated courtroom comedyFind Me Guilty (2006) and thejustly acclaimed crime thrillerBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007) .In 2005, Sidney Lumet received a well-deserved honorary Academy Awardfor his outstanding contribution to filmmaking. Sidney Lumet tragicallydied of cancer in 2011. Twisty Thriller Highlights : Deathtrap, Murder On The Orient Express, Before The Devil Knows Your Dead\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n- ## 9.

The terrific cop thriller\n, the first of his films\nabout police corruption in New York City, became one of his biggest\ncritical and financial successes. 's\nfascinating portrayal of the real-life cop Frank Serpico earned a\nGolden Globe and the movie earned two Academy Award nominations (it is\nworth noting that Lumet's feature films of the 1970s alone earned 30\nOscar nominations, winning six times). The love triangle\n was not always\nconvincing in its atmospheric details, but Lumet's fine sense of\nemotional truth and a good \nkeep it interesting. The adaptation of\n's\n,\nan exquisitely photographed murder mystery with an all-star cast, was a\nbig success again. Lumet's complex crime thriller\n, which\n called \"one of the best \"New\nYork\" movies ever made\", gave  the\nopportunity for a breathtaking, three-dimensional portrayal of a\nbisexual man who tries to rob a bank to finance his lover's sex-change\noperation. Lumet's next masterpiece,\n, was a prophetic satire on\nmedia and society. The film version of\n's stage play\n about a doctor and his\nmentally confused patient was also powerful, not least because of the\nenergetic acting by\n and\n. After the enjoyable\nmusical  and the\ninteresting but not easily accessible comedy\n,\nSidney Lumet won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for his\noutstanding direction of\n, one\nof his best and most typical films. It's about police corruption, but\nhardly a remake of .\nStarring a powerful , it's\nan extraordinarily multi-layered film. In his highly informative book\n\"Making Movies\" (1995), Lumet describes the film in the following way:\n\"When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us.\nNothing is what it seems.\" It's also a movie about values, friendship\nand drug addiction and, like \"Serpico\", is based on a true story. In\n, Lumet successfully\nblended suspense and black humor.\n was voted the\nfourth greatest courtroom drama of all time by the American Film\nInstitute in 2008. A few minor inaccuracies in legal details do not mar\nthis study of an alcoholic lawyer (superbly embodied by\n) aiming to regain his\nself-respect through a malpractice case. The expertly directed movie\nreceived five Academy Award nominations. Lumet's controversial drama\n with\n, an adaptation of\n's \"The Book of Daniel\" about\ntwo young people whose parents were executed during the McCarthy Red\nScare hysteria in the 1950s for alleged espionage, is one of his\nunderrated achievements. His later masterpiece\n has a\nsimilar theme, portraying a family which has been on the run from the\nFBI since the parents (played by\n and\n) committed a bomb attack on a\nnapalm laboratory in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam. The son\n(played by  in an\nextraordinarily moving, Oscar-nominated performance) falls in love with\na girl and wishes to stay with her and study music.\n's screenplay won the Golden\nGlobe. Other Lumet movies of the 1980s are the melancholic comedy drama\n; the occasionally\nclichéd  about election\ncampaigns; the all too slow thriller\n and\nthe amusing gangster comedy\n. With\n Lumet returned to the genre of\nthe New York cop thriller.  shines\nin the role of a corrupt and racist detective in this multi-layered,\nstrangely underrated film. Sadly, with the exception of\n,\nan imperfect but fascinating crime drama in the tradition of his own\nprevious genre works, almost none of Lumet's works of the 1990s did\nquite get the attention they deserved. The crime drama\n\nblended genres in a way that did not seem to match most viewers'\nexpectations, but its contemplations about life arouse interest. The\nintelligent hospital satire\n was unfairly\nneglected as well. The courtroom thriller\n was cold but\nintriguing. Lumet's  remake\nseemed unnecessary, but he returned impressively with the\nunderestimated courtroom comedy\n and the\njustly acclaimed crime thriller\n.\nIn 2005, Sidney Lumet received a well-deserved honorary Academy Award\nfor his outstanding contribution to filmmaking. Sidney Lumet tragically\ndied of cancer in 2011.\n- : Deathtrap, Murder On The Orient Express, Before The Devil Knows Your Dead\n- 10.

John Huston The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) An eccentric rebel of epic proportions, this Hollywood titan reignedsupreme as director, screenwriter and character actor in a career thatendured over five decades. The ten-time Oscar-nominated legend was bornJohn Marcellus Huston in Nevada, Missouri, on August 5, 1906. Hisancestry was English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, distant German and very remote Portuguese. The age-old storygoes that the small town of his birth was won by John's grandfather ina poker game. John's father was the equally magnanimous character actorWalter Huston , and his mother, Rhea Gore,was a newspaperwoman who traveled around the country looking forstories. The only child of the couple, John began performing on stagewith his vaudevillian father at age 3. Upon his parents' divorce at age7, the young boy would take turns traveling around the vaudevillecircuit with his father and the country with his mother on reportingexcursions. A frail and sickly child, he was once placed in asanitarium due to both an enlarged heart and kidney ailment. Making amiraculous recovery, he quit school at age 14 to become a full-fledgedboxer and eventually won the Amateur Lightweight Boxing Championship ofCalifornia, winning 22 of 25 bouts. His trademark broken nose was theresult of that robust activity.John married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Harvey, and also tookhis first professional stage bow with a leading role off-Broadwayentitled \"The Triumph of the Egg.\" He made his Broadway debut that sameyear with \"Ruint\" on April 7, 1925, and followed that with anotherBroadway show \"Adam Solitaire\" the following November. John soon grewrestless with the confines of both his marriage and acting andabandoned both, taking a sojourn to Mexico where he became an officerin the cavalry and expert horseman while writing plays on the sly.Trying to control his wanderlust urges, he subsequently returned toAmerica and attempted newspaper and magazine reporting work in New Yorkby submitting short stories. He was even hired at one point by mogulSamuel Goldwyn Jr. as a screenwriter,but again he grew restless. During this time he also appeared unbilledin a few obligatory films. By 1932 John was on the move again and leftfor London and Paris where he studied painting and sketching. Thepromising artist became a homeless beggar during one harrowing point.Returning again to America in 1933, he played the title role in aproduction of \"Abraham Lincoln,\" only a few years after father Walterportrayed the part on film forD.W. Griffith . John made a newresolve to hone in on his obvious writing skills and begancollaborating on a few scripts for Warner Brothers. He also marriedagain. Warners was so impressed with his talents that he was signed onas both screenwriter and director for theDashiell Hammett mystery yarnThe Maltese Falcon (1941) . Themovie classic made a superstar out ofHumphrey Bogart and is considered bycritics and audiences alike--- 65 years after the fact--- to be thegreatest detective film ever made. In the meantime John wrote/staged acouple of Broadway plays, and in the aftermath of his mammoth screensuccess directed bad-girl'Bette Davis (I)' and good girlOlivia de Havilland in the film melodramaIn This Our Life (1942) , andthree of his \"Falcon\" stars (Bogart,Mary Astor andSydney Greenstreet ) in the romanticwar pictureAcross the Pacific (1942) .During WWII John served as a Signal Corps lieutenant and went on tohelm a number of film documentaries for the U.S. government includingthe controversialLet There Be Light (1980) ,which father Walter narrated. The end of WWII also saw the end of hissecond marriage. He married third wifeEvelyn Keyes , of \"Gone With the Wind\" fame,in 1946 but it too lasted a relatively short time. That same year theimpulsive and always unpredictable Huston directedJean-Paul Sartre 's experimental play\"No Exit\" on Broadway. The show was a box-office bust (running lessthan a month) but nevertheless earned the New York Drama Critics Awardas \"best foreign play.\"Hollywood glory came to him again in association with Bogart and WarnerBrothers'.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) ,a classic tale of gold, greed and man's inhumanity to man set inMexico, won John Oscars for both director and screenplay and his fathernabbed the \"Best Supporting Actor\" trophy. John can be glimpsed at thebeginning of the movie in a cameo playing a tourist, but he wouldn'tact again on film for a decade and a half. With the momentum in hisfavor, John hung around in Hollywood this time to write and/or directsome of the finest American cinema made includingKey Largo (1948) andThe African Queen (1951) (bothwith Bogart),The Asphalt Jungle (1950) ,The Red Badge of Courage (1951) and Moulin Rouge (1952) . Laterfilms, including Moby Dick (1956) ,The Unforgiven (1960) ,The Misfits (1961) ,Freud (1962) ,The Night of the Iguana (1964) andThe Bible: In the Beginning... (1966) were, for the most part, well-regarded but certainly not close to thelevel of his earlier revered work. He also experimentedbehind-the-camera with color effects and approached topics that mostothers would not even broach, including homosexuality andpsychoanalysis.An ardent supporter of human rights, he, along with directorWilliam Wyler and others, dared to formthe Committee for the First Amendment in 1947, which strove toundermine the House Un-American Activities Committee. Disgusted by theHollywood blacklisting that was killing the careers of many talentedfolk, he moved to St. Clerans in Ireland and became a citizen therealong with his fourth wife, ballet dancer Enrica (Ricki) Soma. Thecouple had two children, including daughterAnjelica Huston who went on to have anenviable Hollywood career of her own. Huston and wife Ricki split aftera son (director Danny Huston ) was born toanother actress in 1962. They did not divorce, however, and remainedestranged until her sudden death in 1969 in a car accident. Johnsubsequently adopted his late wife's child from another union. Theever-impulsive Huston would move yet again to Mexico where he married(1972) and divorced (1977) his fifth and final wife, Celeste Shane.Huston returned to acting auspiciously with a major role inOtto Preminger 's epic filmThe Cardinal (1963) for which Hustonreceived an Oscar nomination at age 57. From that time forward, hewould be glimpsed here and there in a number of colorful, baggy-eyedcharacter roles in both good and bad (some positively abysmal) filmsthat, at the very least, helped finance his passion projects. Theformer list included outstanding roles inChinatown (1974) andThe Wind and the Lion (1975) ,while the latter comprised of hammy parts in such awful drek asCandy (1968) andMyra Breckinridge (1970) .Directing daughter Angelica in her inauspicious movie debut, thethoroughly mediocreA Walk with Love and Death (1969) ,John made up for it 15 years later by directing her to Oscar glory inthe mob talePrizzi's Honor (1985) . In the1970s Huston resurged as a director of quality films withFat City (1972) ,The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and Wise Blood (1979) . He ended hiscareer on a high note withUnder the Volcano (1984) , theafore-mentionedPrizzi's Honor (1985) andThe Dead (1987) . His only certifiablemisfire during that era was the elephantine musical version ofAnnie (1982) , though it later becamesomewhat of a cult favorite among children.Huston lived the macho, outdoors life, unencumbered by convention orrestrictions, and is often compared in style or flamboyancy to anErnest Hemingway orOrson Welles .

Fritz Lang Contempt (1963) Fritz Lang was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1890. His father managed aconstruction company. His mother, Pauline Schlesinger, was Jewish butconverted to Catholicism when Lang was ten. After high school, heenrolled briefly at the Technische Hochschule Wien and then started totrain as a painter. From 1910 to 1914, he traveled in Europe, and hewould later claim, also in Asia and North Africa. He studied paintingin Paris from 1913-14. At the start of World War I, he returned toVienna, enlisting in the army in January 1915. Severely wounded in June1916, he wrote some scenarios for films while convalescing. In early1918, he was sent home shell-shocked and acted briefly in Viennesetheater before accepting a job as a writer atErich Pommer 's production company inBerlin, Decla. In Berlin, Lang worked briefly as a writer and then as adirector, at Ufa and then for Nero-Film, owned by the AmericanSeymour Nebenzal . In 1920, he began arelationship with actress and writerThea von Harbou (1889-1954), who wrotewith him the scripts for his most celebrated films:Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler (1922) ,Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924) ,Metropolis (1927) andM (1931) (credited to von Harbou alone). Theymarried in 1922 and divorced in 1933. In that year, Nazi propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels offered Lang thejob of head of the German Cinema Institute. Lang--who was an anti-Nazimainly because of his Catholic background--did not accept the position(it was later offered to and accepted by filmmakerLeni Riefenstahl ) and, after secretlysending most of his money out of the country, fled Germany to Paris.After about a year in Paris, Lang moved to the United States inmid-1934, initially under contract to MGM. Over the next 20 years, hedirected numerous American films. In the 1950s, in part because thefilm industry was in economic decline and also because of Lang'slong-standing reputation for being difficult with, and abusive to,actors, he found it increasingly hard to get work. At the end of the1950s, he traveled to Germany and made what turned out to be his finalthree films there, none of which were well received.In 1964, nearly blind, he was chosen to be president of the jury at theCannes Film Festival. He was an avid collector of primitive art andhabitually wore a monocle, an affectation he picked up during his earlydays in Vienna. After his divorce from von Harbou, he had relationshipswith many other women, but from about 1931 to his death in 1976, he wasclose to Lily Latte , who helped him in manyways.

Robert Siodmak Nachts wenn der Teufel kam (1957) Robert Siodmak (8 August 1900 - 10 March 1973) was a German-born, American film director. He is best remembered as a thriller specialist and for a series of stylish, unpretentious Hollywood films noirs he made in the 1940s.Siodmak (pronounced SEE-ODD-MACK) was born in Dresden, Germany, the son of Rosa Philippine (née Blum) and Ignatz Siodmak. His parents were both from Jewish families in Leipzig (the myth of his American birth in Memphis, Tennessee was necessary for him to obtain a visa in Paris during World War II). He worked as a stage director and a banker before becoming editor and scenarist for Curtis Bernhardt in 1925 (Bernhardt would direct a film of Siodmak's story \"Conflict\" in 1945). At twenty-six he was hired by his cousin, producer Seymour Nebenzal, to assemble original silent movies from stock footage of old films. Siodmak worked at this for two years before he persuaded Nebenzal to finance his first feature, the silent chef d'oeuvre, \"Menschen am Sonntag\" (\"People on Sunday\") in1929. The script was co-written by Billy Wilder and Siodmak's brother Curt Siodmak, later the screenwriter of \"The Wolf Man\" (1941). It was the last German silent and also included such future Hollywood artists as Fred Zinnemann, Edgar G. Ulmer, and Eugen Schufftan. His next film--the first at UFA to use sound--was the 1930 comedy \"Abschied\" for writers Emeric Pressburger and Irma von Cube, followed by \"Der Mann, der seinen Mörder sucht,\" another comedy, yet quite different and unusual, a likely product of Billy Wilder's imagination (remade a noir, \"DOA,\" in 1950). But in his next film, the crime thriller \"Stürme der Leidenschaft,\" with Emil Jannings and Anna Sten, Siodmak found a style that would become his own.With the rise of Nazism and following an attack in the press by Hitler's minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels in 1933 after viewing \"Brennendes Geheimnis\" (\"The Burning Secret\"), Siodmak left Germany for Paris. His creativity flourished, as he worked for the next six years in a variety of film genres, from comedy (\"Le sexe fable\" and \"La Vie Parisienne\" ) to musical (\"La crise est finie,\" with Danielle Darrieux) to drama (\"Mister Flow,\" \"Cargaison blanche,\" \"Mollenard\"--compare Gabrielle Dorziat's shrewish wife with that of Rosalind Ivan's in \"The Suspect\"--and the superb \"Pièges,\" with Maurice Chevalier and Erich Von Stroheim). While in France, he was well on his way to becoming successor to Rene Clair, until Hitler again forced him out. Siodmak arrived in Hollywood in 1939, where he made 23 movies, many of them widely popular thrillers and crime melodramas, which critics today regard as classics of film noir.Beginning in 1941, he first turned out several B-films and programmers for various studios before he gained a seven-year contract with Universal Studios in 1943. The best of those early films are the thriller \"Fly by Night\" in 1942, with Richard Carlson and Nancy Kelly, and in 1943 the touching weepie \"Someone to Remember,\" with Mable Paige in a signature role. As house director, his services were often used to salvage troublesome productions at the studio. On Mark Hellinger's production \"Swell Guy\" (1946), for instance, Siodmak was brought in to replace Frank Tuttle only six days after completing work on \"The Killers.\" Siodmak worked steadily while under contract, overshadowed by high profile directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, with whom he had been often compared by the press.At Universal, Siodmak made yet another B-film, \"Son of Dracula\"(1943), the third and best in a trilogy of Dracula movies (based on his brother Curt's original story). His second feature, and first A-film, was the Maria Montez/Jon Hall vehicle, \"Cobra Woman\" (1944), made in garish Technicolor (Montez's cobra dance alone is worth the price of admission).His first all-out noir was \"Phantom Lady\" (1944), for staff producer Joan Harrison, Universal's first female executive and Alfred Hitchcock's former secretary and script assistant. A classic, however flawed, it showcased Siodmak's skill with camera and editing to dazzling effect, but no more so than in the iconic jam-session sequence with Elisha Cook Jr. in throes on the drums. Following the critical success of \"Phantom Lady,\" Siodmak directed \"Christmas Holiday\" (1944) with Deanna Durbin and Gene Kelly (Hans J. Salter received an Oscar nomination for best music). Beginning with this film, his work in Hollywood attained the stylistic and thematic characteristics that are evident in his later noirs. \"Christmas Holiday,\" adapted from a W. Somerset Maugham novel by Herman J. Mankiewicz, was Durbin's most successful feature, which she considered her only good film (and that Mankiewicz said was among his work in the 40s of which he was most proud). Siodmak's use of black-and-white cinematography and urban landscapes, together with his light-and-shadow designs, formed the basic structure of class",

In fact, sometimes the best films—or aspects of films—come from looking inward for sources of turmoil that can feel more real and be more relatable for viewers than any gunfight or car chase.  We're talking about stories that explore mental illness, and what kind of impact varying illness can have on lives, relationships, and more. And while mental illness still holds far too significant of a stigma in modern society, that stigma is decreasing; mainstream depiction in films seen and loved by many can be a major factor in continuing to break down that wall.\n\nMovies either centering on or touching upon mental illness aren't a new concept, but the range of genres doing so is wider than ever before. From romantic comedies to action blockbusters, a discussion on mental illness—and mental health—can be found almost anywhere. In fact, a movie doesn't even need to be about mental illness or mental health to be part of the ongoing surrounding conversation. That could be a good way to normalize the conversation, and some of the movies on out list below do a great job of doing so.\n\nThe list below is in no way expansive, but it does cover a lot of ground. Some movies are great, some are merely good, but all do a great job of facilitating the conversation that it's important for all of us to be having.\n\n## Silver Linings Playbook (2012)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on Matthew Quick's novel of the same name, Silver Linings Playbook follows its two main characters closely. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan and diagnosed bipolar who's recently been released from a stint in a mental hospital, and Jennifer Lawrence (in her Oscar-winning role) plays a widow dealing with her own mental illness in the aftermath of her husband's death. Despite those seemingly-heavy themes, the movie is actually a fantastic romantic comedy, showing the ways two people with their own sets of problems can find greatness in one another, even when they aren't looking for it. Bonus greatness comes in the form of performances from Robert DeNiro, Jackie Weaver, Chris Tucker, and a really great soundtrack.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerhaps the most famous movie ever made about mental illness is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the classic from Milos Foreman. The movie, rightly considered a classic, finds a criminal who pleaded insanity (Jack Nicholson) in a mental asylum, helping to lead his fellow patients in an uprising against the abusive nurse (Louise Fletcher) who takes advantage of them.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Trainspotting (1996)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAddiction is without question a mental illness, and no movie shows it for the high highs and low lows better than director Danny Boyle's stylish breakout hit Trainspotting. The film, led by Ewan McGregor's Renton, follows a group of heroin0-addicted friends in '90s Scotland, and it's fun one minute, with one of the best soundtracks around, and absolutely horrifying the next. Trainspotting is a staple of modern cinema, and for good reason.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Aftersun (2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerhaps the best depiction of living through manic depression in recent years is Aftersun, the debut film from director Charlotte Wells. Following a young father (Paul Mescal) and his daughter (Frankie Corio) on a vacation, the movie dives deep into these two specific characters, and the impact this trip holds even years later. Mescal has been one of the industry's shining stars, but his performance in Aftersun—which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor—is the highlight of his career thus far.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Take Shelter (2011)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTake Shelter, starring Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain and coming from director Jeff Nichols, is a psychological thriller in every sense of the word. The film depicts the paranoia that comes along with schizophrenia—the illness runs in Shannon's character's family, and  viewers are forced to share his same fears: is this really happening, or is it just happening to me? This film features one of Shannon's best performances, and the uncertainty that comes along with its storyline is something that all of those diagnosed with a mental illness like schizophrenia can likely relate to.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Birth (2004)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector Jonathan Glazer has only made four films, all of which are made specifically when he's got something to say or something, specifically, he wants to explore. Birth, which came out in 2004, is an interesting and at times distressing look at grief. Nicole Kidman plays a woman who's husband suddenly died during a run in the park, only for a boy to show up years later claiming to be her late husband reincarnated. Much of this wasn't considered anything more than typical grief or PTSD, but Prolonged Grief Disorder became a diagnosable mental illness in DSM-5, and the symptoms are significantly at play in this engaging and interesting film.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Girl, Interrupted (1999)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJames Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) directed Girl, Interrupted which follows a young woman (Winona Ryder) who finds herself institutionalized following a suicide attempt. Inside the institution (called Claymoore) she meets another young woman (Angelina Jolie), and the film explores how these characters grow throughout the course of her 18-month stay.\n\nGirl, Interrupted is set in the late '60s, and makes for an interested modern day watch because not only do you get to see how the perception of mental illness and health changed between the '60s and 1999 (when the film was released), but also the differences between 1999 and now. Based on Susanna Kaysen's book of the same name.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## The King of Staten Island (2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe newest movie on this list, The King of Staten Island follows a recent pattern of movies directed by Judd Apatow, in which he allows his lead actor to co-write the movie in order to tell (some version of) their own story. The King of Staten Island, then, follows many of the same beats as star Pete Davidson's life. He plays a kid from, yes, Staten Island, who's lost his father at a young age, and has grown up his entire life with depression and a diagnosis with bipolar disorder.\n\nThe movie shows the beats of Davidson's character's life, and also shows how his own life intersects with those around him, including his mother (Marissa Tomei), sister (Maude Apatow), friends, and mother's boyfriend (Bill Burr). The movie is funny in many of the ways you'd expect from Apatow and Davidson, but even more manages to tell a great story with a really big heart.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Black Swan (2010)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce you know that Black Swan was directed by Darren Aronofsky—a master at following someone slowly losing their grip on sanity—everything else makes perfect sense. Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her role as a dancer who lands a heavily-coveted role in a ballet production, and has trouble dealing with the internal and external pressure that comes after.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Lars and the Real Girl (2007)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRyan Gosling might give his best performance in Lars and the Real Girl, where he plays the titular shy, introverted main character, who finally finds the \"real girl\" of his dreams...who just happens to be a doll he found on the internet. The movie takes place in a small town where everyone knows one another, so rather than making fun of him, the town mostly plays along, allowing Gosling's character—and all of the years of trauma that resulted in this delusion—to run its course.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Fight Club (1999)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf Lars and the Real Girl is mostly a nice movie, well, David Fincher's Fight Club is...uh, not. Fight Club is aggressive and in your face about what it means, with not-so-subtle points all along the way about toxic masculinity, suppressed pain and trauma, and way more. If you somehow haven't seen Fight Club and haven't had it spoiled, you're in for a big treat—Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both mesmerizing, and Fincher does as Fincher does. The movie is stunning from start to finish.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## A Beautiful Mind (2001)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Beautiful Mind is a fairly straightforward entry on this list, telling the true-life tale of paranoid schizophrenic mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe), who takes on additional work and begins to believe that he's involved in a massive conspiracy. Anyone who's been watching MCU movies or WandaVision will also be pleased to find a relatively early Paul Bettany performance here as well. \n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Little Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine doesn't entirely revolve around mental health or mental illness, but it plays a huge role in the movie. The inciting incident of the film is a family road trip in a yellow VW bus taking young Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in a pageant. But just before the events of the film, Frank (Steve Carell) has just attempted suicide, and Duane (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence. The movie shows how different people handle different forms of trauma, and does so in a total package that's both respectful and entertaining.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## It's Kind Of a Funny Story (2010)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt's Kind of a Funny Story, based on the novel of the same name, is about a 16-year-old kid who spends time in the psychiatric hospital after contemplating suicide. The movie, which features Keir Gilchrist in the lead, along with Emma Roberts, Viola Davis, and Zach Galifianakis, is not as grim as it may sound. In fact, it's fairly light in tone, showing that the people who need help are just that: people who need help, people who make jokes, and people who can help others, too.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## The Skeleton Twins (2014)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Skeleton Twins pairs two beloved Saturday Night Live alums—Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig—together as estranged twins brought together by tragic circumstance: the former attempted suicide, and the latter was about to do the same—until she found out about her brother. The two reunite, and the movie dives deep and carefully into the subject of depression. Of course, the movie takes on a lighter tone as it goes along and we get to know the characters and they learn to accept themselves. Plus, the two great leads do what they're best at.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape finds a dysfunctional family where the titular character (Johnny Depp) is a young man who needs to care for his family members, including his mentally-impaired younger brother and mother, who's morbidly obsese and confined to her home as a result of an eating disorder. The movie not only explores the lives of the latter two characters amidst their impairments, but also the stress and anxiety that it puts on Gilbert as their de facto caretaker.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Matchstick Men (2003)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNicolas Cage does a lot of bad movies, but a lot of good movies too. Matchstick Men, where he plays a con man with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, is one of the good ones. The movie follows Cage's character and his partner, played by Sam Rockwell, as the two plan to pull off a big score—only to be interrupted by the discovery of Cage's character's daughter from a brief past marriage. One of director Ridley Scott's most underrated movies, and based on the novel of the same name.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerks of Being a Wallflower was a YA sensation when it was initially released as a novel by Stephen Chobsky, and it's proven to be just as lasting a success in film form (which Chobsky directed himself). The story follows Charlie, a high school freshman who's a bit shy and prone to anxiety at first, but manages to find himself as he makes high school friends.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Uncut Gems (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSometimes the most destructive of behaviors are mental illnesses, and a compulsive gambling addiction would certainly qualify. Uncut Gems isn't only Adam Sandler's best performance of his career, but the entire movie is fantastic, as Benny and Josh Safdie manage to get the audience on the side of Sandler's Howard Ratner, a man who risks far too much and brings his entire life to the brink as a way to appease his destructive urges to gamble on basically any and everything.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Welcome to Me (2015)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWelcome to Me is one of the strangest movies on the list, anchored by a really winning performance from Kristen Wiig. The former SNL star here plays a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder who wins the lottery after stopping taking her medication, and immediately uses the money to buy and put on her own daytime talk show. The movie is just as wild as it sounds, but puts the spotlight on a mental illness that doesn't often get much publicity. Wiig does a great job of playing the character with real traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, including mood swings and inability to maintain relationships.\n\nStream It Here\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow ‘Reacher’ Season 3 Compares to the Book\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n‘Invincible’ Is Back Sooner Than We Expected\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n‘Reacher’ Is Finally Back for Season 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn '80s Staple Made an Epic '1923' Cameo\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Movies We Can’t Wait for in 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'1923' Continues the 'Yellowstone' Story With S2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The Righteous' Gemstones' Goes Full '1923'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou Need To Be Watching ‘The White Lotus’ Season 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow Jon Gries Became 'White Lotus's Biggest Twist\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Complete Ranking of Bong Joon-ho Movies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Lumon Gang Is Back for ‘Severance’ Season 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Ultimate 'Sad Man in Space' Movie Ranking\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\n\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n\n©2025 Hearst Magazines, Inc.
