This suggests that they enjoy unraveling complex plots and may possess strong analytical skills in other areas of their life as well. The mention of \"thriller\" also implies that they appreciate suspense and the intellectual challenge of predicting outcomes, which aligns with a personality that enjoys problem-solving and critical analysis.\n\n2. **Appreciation for Complexity:**  \n   By highlighting \"Absolute Power\" as a favorite, the user indicates a preference for intricate storytelling that often involves layered characters and multifaceted plots. This suggests that they may be drawn to narratives that reflect the complexities of human behavior and relationships. Their interest in psychological thrillers like \"Shutter Island\" further emphasizes this trait, as such films typically explore deep psychological themes and moral ambiguities, appealing to someone who values depth in storytelling.\n\n3. **Value for Unconventional Narratives:**  \n   The user’s enjoyment of the \"unlikely hero style\" suggests an appreciation for characters who defy traditional archetypes and face extraordinary challenges. This inclination may reflect a broader interest in narratives that challenge societal norms or expectations, indicating that the user values originality and perhaps sees themselves as someone who appreciates or embodies uniqueness in their own life.\n\n4. **Interest in Justice and Morality:**  \n   The choice of films like \"Absolute Power,\" which deals with themes of power, corruption, and moral dilemmas, suggests that the user may have a strong interest in justice and ethical questions. This could indicate a personality that is not only concerned with fairness but also intrigued by the darker aspects of human nature and the consequences of moral choices. Such interests often align with individuals who are reflective and may engage in discussions about ethics and societal issues.\n\nIn summary, the user's cinematic preferences reveal a personality that is analytical, values complexity, appreciates unconventional narratives, and has a keen interest in themes of justice and morality. These traits suggest a thoughtful individual who seeks depth and meaning in both their entertainment choices and potentially in their broader worldview.",

No? Just me? OK, WELL. Whether you want to or not, I figured it’s high-time to celebrate some of the books that left me the most mentally scarred. Because after surviving the pandemic, what ELSE would I want to dwell on, y’know?\n\nEver since the rampant success of novels like Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl, thrillers have been in a never-ending twist-off competition, constantly trying to out-do each other with jaw-dropping, out-of-nowhere plot explosions that don’t even necessarily make sense, most of the time. So this list is reserved solely for the novels that seamlessly slipped in twists that felt satisfying, earned, and of course, truly f*cking shocking. (And no, Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window, and Gone Girl are not included — they’re great and we all know it by now.)\n\n# Check out my latest thriller reviews!\n\n# 〰️\n\n# Check out my latest thriller reviews!\n〰️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Check out my latest thriller reviews! 〰️\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Stay Awake' by Megan Goldin\n\nI've gotta be honest: at first I thought Stay Awake by Megan Goldin might be a watered-down rip-off of S. J. Watson's 2011 thriller Before I Go to Sleep. And, to be fair, there are some striking similarities: the heroine loses all memories of the previous day if she goes to sleep; she's surrounded by men who she can't fully trust; someone (who likely caused her memory loss in the first place) appears to want her dead. However, I have to give Goldin props — she takes a plot I could've sworn I'd seen before and creates a chilling, compulsively readable thriller with plenty of new things to fall in love with (and get freaked out by).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'My Murder' by Katie Williams\n\nIf you want to get technical, everything in My Murder by Katie Williams really boils down to one simple question: “What if you had to solve your own murder?” (Hah, just kidding — it’s anything but simple.) For me, the book more than lives up to its inventive premise — the victim of a local serial killer is brought back from the dead by a government project, and begins to suspect not all is at it seems — delivering a twist that’s as bittersweet as it is surprising.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Quiet Girl' by S.F. Kosa\n\nS.F. Kosa's The Quiet Girl follows a husband’s efforts to track down his missing wife, and is a bit of a psychological mind-f*ck, to say the least. It kept me guessing quite literally until the last chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Night Shift' by Alex Finlay\n\nThis fast-paced novel about a pair of Final Girls trying to figure out the person behind a new, vicious massacre is good as hellllll. It’s a thriller designed to shock and awe, so of course there are some occasionally eye-roll-worthy moments. But it’s excellently plotted with pulse-pounding twists that don’t feel forced or out of the left field’s left field (for the most part).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Hidden Pictures' by Jason Rekulak\n\nI truly think that the eerie Hidden Pictures by Jason Rekulakis one of those twisty novels that is best read with as little beforehand knowledge about the ins and outs of the story as possible. It’s entertaining and engaging, with Rekulak deftly moving the story along at a fast clip, leading to a jaw-dropping, polarizing twist.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'When No One Is Watching' by Alyssa Cole\n\nWhen No One Is Watching gives Brooklyn’s growing gentrification problem an even more horrifying spin in this thriller, which has shades of Rear Window and Get Out. It’s not my favorite book in the world, but there’s no denying it packs a twisty punch.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Good Girl' by Mary Kubica\n\nMary Kubica's The Good Girl is a fast-paced, taut thriller revolving around a high-profile kidnapping case in Chicago: Mia Dennett, the 20-something daughter of a prominent judge, is abducted by a strange man and held for ransom. Rather than telling the story from Mia’s perspective in captivity, the novel sees things through the eyes of Mia's anxiety-ridden mom, the world-weary detective assigned to her case, and, most importantly, the desperate man holding her hostage. It moves at a breakneck pace, and the last, “oh DAMN” twist has always stayed with me.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Long Weekend' by Gilly MacMillan\n\nRegardless of my ultimate feelings about The Long Weekend, I have to hand it to author Gilly Macmillan: she clearly set out to do the absolute f*cking most when it came to this twisty, unpredictable thriller, and she succeeded. Really, really, really succeeded. Did she sit down before writing this story — about a girl’s trip gone awry when a mysterious note threatening the lives of their husbands is delivered to their isolated retreat — and say to herself, “how many truly unhinged characters I can conceivably squeeze into one novel?” It certainly seems so. (And I’m grateful for the choice, oop.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Child' by Fiona Barton\n\nSuper intense mystery alert! When the decades-old bones of an infant are discovered at a construction site in London in Fiona Barton’s The Child, journalist Kate Waters sets out to uncover the identity of the baby — could it be the same child who was stolen from a maternity ward in a local hospital decades earlier, but never found?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'In a Dark, Dark Wood' by Ruth Ware\n\nBad bachelorette parties usually involve Vegas, too much vodka, and a crying bride-to-be wearing a penis headband. Well, that’s not quite what the heroine of Ruth Ware's A Dark, Dark Wood experiences, but after reading it, I’d take a rough Vegas trip any day. In this twisty thriller, Leonora, a reclusive writer, agrees to attend the ‘hen do’ for a high school pal she hasn't spoken to in years, and soon finds old resentments and bitter feuds bubbling back up to the surface, ending in a shocking act of violence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Silent Patient' by Alex Michaelides\n\nI don’t even want to say too much about The Silent Patient, a truly shocking psychological thriller, for fear of spoiling even a teensy, tiny bit of it, but the gist is this: a woman's gruesome act of violence against her husband comes to the attention of a therapist, who falls deep into an obsession to uncover her motive. I know this book has been hyped to hell and back, at this point, but I really do think it lives up to its acclaim.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'His &amp; Hers' by Alice Feeney\n\nI wasn’t necessarily a huge fan of His &amp; Hers by Alice Feeny, but there’s no denying that this story is layered with twist after wild twist. It begins with a murder in a small, quintessentially British village, which leads a detective and a reporter assigned to cover the case down a dangerous path.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Wife Between Us' by Greer Hendricks &amp; Sarah Pekkanen\n\nThis book is jaw-dropping and disorienting in the best possible way — The Wife Between Us is a cat and mouse game, of sorts, between a jealous ex-wife and the pretty young woman who’s replaced her. But what if all is not as it seems? Dun, dun, DUNNNN.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'It's Always the Husband' by Michele Campbell\n\nI really wish I could erase this book from my mind completely just so I can have the pleasure of reading it with fresh, innocent eyes one more time. It’s Always the Husband is an ode to the kinds of friendships that burn bright and fast before flaming out in disastrous ways. Like, for example, ending with a murder on a bridge. Yikes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Seven Visitations of Sydney Burgess' by Andy Marino\n\nPrepare yourself, because reading The Seven Visitations of Sydney Burgess by Andy Marino feels like falling into a particularly grim fever dream. And I don’t necessarily mean that in a bad way! But this book is trippy, and leans harder and harder into stomach-turning body horror with each passing chapter as it sets up a twisty, devastating resolution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'We Were Liars' by E. Lockhart\n\nI brought this book on a vacation, and spent a few very intense hours ignoring my friends, the beach, the sun, and even the extremely loud people under the umbrella next to me as I ripped through this bleak, hypnotic, and incredibly suspenseful novel about a group of four young friends’ whose bond turns destructive. Go get We Were Liars and then settle in — you won’t be moving anytime soon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Last Word' by Taylor Adams\n\nThis eerie, claustrophobic thriller from the author of No Exit (another book with top-tier twists, btw) introduces us to a woman in a remote beach house who begins to wonder if an author is retaliating because of her one-star review of his book. It’s a fun read, and does a solid job of creating a tense atmosphere while ramping up the psychological suspense. To be fair, I did have some issues with it overall, but similar to No Exit, Adams’ method of blending gut-churning fear with jaw-dropping twists is undeniably effective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Darling Rose Gold' by Stephanie Wrobel\n\nFor a while there I was really burned out on the Munchausen syndrome by proxy obsession in pop culture (looking at you, Ryan Murphy), but then Darling Rose Gold came along and changed my mind. The story: After serving five years in prison, Patty Watts (who spent years convincing her daughter, Rose Gold, that she was ill even though she was perfectly healthy) gets out with nowhere to go and begs her daughter to take her in. The entire community is shocked when Rose Gold says yes, and then…..well, I’ll leave that for YOU to find out.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Shutter Island' by Dennis LeHane\n\nIf you haven’t already seen the movie adaption of Shutter Island, then go pick up this thrilling, atmospheric mystery about a US Marshal who’s sent to investigate the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in the 1950s. When the truth is finally revealed, you'll be rereading the final passages over and over again to make sure you aren't going crazy, too.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'The Hand That Feeds You' by A.J. Rich\n\nThis book is WILD, starting with a woman coming home to her apartment to find her fiancé mauled to death, and her normally docile dog covered in blood. But the real story in The Hand That Feeds You is, somehow, a whole lot deeper (and crazier) than that.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 'Sharp Objects' by Gillian Flynn\n\nAll hail Gillian Flynn, queen of batshit-crazy plot twists that somehow feel smart and well-earned, as well as jaw-dropping, all at once. You can’t really have a list of thrillers featuring shocking moments without her, you know? Sharp Objects is a personal fave (I really love Dark Places, too, fwiw) and packs one of the biggest literary gut-punches I’ve stumbled across in quite a while. Here’s the rundown, if you haven’t read it yet or seen the (equally excellent) TV adaptation: as journalist Camille Preaker reports on the unsolved murder of a preteen girl and the disappearance of another in her tiny hometown, she unearths disturbing memories as well as gruesome revelations regarding the killings.\n\n# The Most Disturbing Horror Novels I’ve Ever Read\n\n# 〰️\n\n# The Most Disturbing Horror Novels I’ve Ever Read\n〰️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        The Most Disturbing Horror Novels I’ve Ever Read 〰️\n\nNot done reading? You can shop my full list of thrillers with the best twists on Bookshop.org:\n\n© 2020 - 2025 What Is Quinn Reading? — Unauthorized use and/or duplication of this material without express and written permission from this site’s author and/or owner is strictly prohibited.

Thieves. Liars. And these are the ones we’re rooting for. In the heist and caper films, we see the hero hatching a plan, putting together a crew, and then pulling off the job, usually in order to turn the screws against an institution or person that’s wronged them — or maybe just for the thrill of sticking up banks. Either way, we put together a list of the 78 best-reviewed heist movies of all time for you to look over, each with at least 20 reviews and sorted by ranking formula, which factors how long ago a movie was released and how many critics reviews it got overall.

Films tend to give me some kind of hope to hold onto, or an idea that I can be better than the person I am.

The vast majority of that is related to characters doing stupid things, but there were a few times where the laws of physics were avoided as well.

                "reviewerThoughts": "Diving into Sharp Objects was like peeling back layers of a very dark onion—each revelation more unsettling than the last. Flynn’s portrayal of small-town dynamics and the facade of Southern gentility hiding deep-seated dysfunctions was spot on. The characters, especially Camille, are deeply flawed, making them feel real and relatable, even when their actions are hard to digest. I appreciated the exploration of complex mother-daughter relationships and the generational trauma that can ensue. Adora’s character, in particular, was both fascinating and horrifying, embodying a twisted form of maternal care that left me both enraged and empathetic towards Camille’s plight. However, the novel’s intense focus on psychological trauma and self-harm can be heavy, and there were moments when I had to pause and process the weight of the content. The pacing, while building suspense effectively, occasionally felt slow, especially when delving into Camille’s internal struggles. Overall, Sharp Objects is a compelling read that delves deep into the psyche of its characters, offering a dark and twisted narrative that kept me engaged, even if it left me a bit unsettled at times."

Not many thrillers slow down to notice relationships, but this one does.\n\nEastwood stars as Luther Whitney, a burglar who breaks into a mansion in the dead of night and penetrates a hidden room filled with diamonds and cash. He’s interrupted in the middle of his work by visitors. Hiding behind a two-way mirror, he sees a man and woman having sex. The play turns rough, the man beats her, the woman stabs him, and two men burst in and shoot her dead.\n\nEastwood watches, all but his eyes in shadow. He is about to intervene–risking discovery–when the gunshots ring out. He escapes from the mansion down a rope from a third-floor window, carrying with him the deadly knowledge that the woman was the younger wife of an 80-year-old millionaire, and the man was the president of the United States.\n\nWhat we have here is a setup that could be developed in a lot of ways. The recent and dreadful “Shadow Conspiracy” detailed a White House plot that was cheerfully absurd. “Absolute Power,” based loosely on a best-selling novel by David Baldacci, could have been as silly, but it’s not because Eastwood uses fine actors and a smart script by William Goldman to make it into something more.\n\nA lot of the best qualities come from the thief’s relationship with his daughter, Kate (Laura Linney), “the only kid in show-and-tell who got to talk about visiting day.” Her dad was in prison most of her childhood. Now she’s a prosecutor and never sees him. But sometimes she senses he’s watching her; one of the movie’s best scenes has her discovering that he attended her graduation ceremonies. Why did he remain invisible? Having an ex-con for a father would not help her much.\n\nThe story behind the murder is developed briskly. Old Walter Sullivan (E. G. Marshall) is a prime backer of the president (Gene Hackman). He was happily married for 48 years, but after his wife’s death he took a younger wife. The men who burst into the mansion bedroom and shot her were Secret Service agents (Dennis Haysbert and Scott Glenn). The coverup is being orchestrated by a White House chief of staff (Judy Davis).\n\nSeth Frank (Ed Harris), the cop on the case, immediately notices all sorts of suspicious loose ends: Two shots were fired but only one bullet was recovered, for example, and the gunshot trajectories don’t match. He suspects this was more than a simple murder.\n\nMost thrillers depend on chase scenes and shoot-outs. Some of best scenes in “Absolute Power” involve dialogue. The cop immediately fingers Luther Whitney as a possible suspect (he’s one of “only six guys alive” who could have gotten into the mansion), and interviews him in a museum dining room. Eastwood, wearing half-glasses and a cloth cap that accentuate his age, smiles laconically and says, “Go down a rope in the middle of the night? If I could do that, I’d be the star of my AARP meetings.” There is another good scene between Ed Harris and old E. G. Marshall, who tells the policeman the two-way mirror was installed in the bedroom at his wife’s suggestion: “She thought I might have liked sitting there. I didn’t.” His is a poignant character, a self-made man who has spent his life giving money to charity, who has elected a president and who now fears “I’ll go out as the joke of the world.” Eastwood delivers a few nice set pieces as the suspense builds, including a rendezvous with his daughter in a public plaza while two sets of gunmen train their sights on him. And we get hard-boiled dialogue in the Oval Office as the president and his merciless chief of staff run the coverup by ordering the Secret Servicemen to do things not covered in their job description (one is willing, one has qualms). Much depends on a hypocritical speech the president makes, which Luther sees at an airport bar just as he’s about to flee the country. In a classic Eastwood moment, the thief’s jaw hardens and he decides to stay and fight, rather than give a pass to a heartless liar.\n\nEastwood as director is usually eclipsed by Eastwood the actor; he has directed almost 20 films, good enough and successful enough to make him one of Hollywood’s top filmmakers, and yet his stardom overshadows that role. Here he creates scenes of pure moviemaking–scenes without dialogue or violence, that work only because we know the characters and because the direction, camera work (by Jack N. Green) and editing (Joel Cox) put them together into suspenseful montages. The opening sequence is especially effective.\n\nBut at the end what I remembered most was the relationship between father and daughter. By using this personal story as an arc to draw together the other elements in the film, Eastwood does a difficult thing: He makes a thriller that is not upstaged by its thrills. Luther Whitney is a genuinely interesting, complicated character–not just an action figure.

Not many <Genre>thrillers</Genre> slow down to notice relationships, but this one does.\n\n        Eastwood stars as <HeroArchetype>Luther Whitney</HeroArchetype>, a burglar who breaks into a mansion in the dead of night and penetrates a hidden room filled with diamonds and cash. He’s interrupted in the middle of his work by visitors. Hiding behind a two-way mirror, he sees a man and woman having sex. The play turns rough, the man beats her, the woman stabs him, and two men burst in and shoot her dead.\n\n        Eastwood watches, all but his eyes in shadow. He is about to intervene–risking discovery–when the gunshots ring out. He escapes from the mansion down a rope from a third-floor window, carrying with him the deadly knowledge that the woman was the younger wife of an 80-year-old millionaire, and the man was the president of the United States.\n\n        What we have here is a setup that could be developed in a lot of ways. The recent and dreadful “Shadow Conspiracy” detailed a White House plot that was cheerfully absurd. “<Name>Absolute Power</Name>,” based loosely on a best-selling novel by <BasedOn>David Baldacci</BasedOn>, could have been as silly, but it’s not because Eastwood uses fine actors and a smart script by <ScreenplayBy>William Goldman</ScreenplayBy> to make it into something more.\n\n        A lot of the best qualities come from the thief’s relationship with his daughter, <HeroArchetype>Kate</HeroArchetype> (<Laura Linney>), “the only kid in show-and-tell who got to talk about visiting day.” Her dad was in prison most of her childhood. Now she’s a prosecutor and never sees him. But sometimes she senses he’s watching her; one of the movie’s best scenes has her discovering that he attended her graduation ceremonies. Why did he remain invisible? Having an ex-con for a father would not help her much.\n\n        The story behind the murder is developed briskly. Old Walter Sullivan (<E.G. Marshall>) is a prime backer of the president (<Gene Hackman>). He was happily married for 48 years, but after his wife’s death he took a younger wife. The men who burst into the mansion bedroom and shot her were Secret Service agents (<Dennis Haysbert> and <Scott Glenn>). The coverup is being orchestrated by a White House chief of staff (<Judy Davis>).\n\n        Seth Frank (<Ed Harris>), the cop on the case, immediately notices all sorts of suspicious loose ends: Two shots were fired but only one bullet was recovered, for example, and the gunshot trajectories don’t match. He suspects this was more than a simple murder.\n\n        Most <Genre>thrillers</Genre> depend on chase scenes and shoot-outs. Some of the best scenes in “<Name>Absolute Power</Name>” involve dialogue. The cop immediately fingers <HeroArchetype>Luther Whitney</HeroArchetype> as a possible suspect (he’s one of “only six guys alive” who could have gotten into the mansion), and interviews him in a museum dining room. Eastwood, wearing half-glasses and a cloth cap that accentuate his age, smiles laconically and says, “Go down a rope in the middle of the night? If I could do that, I’d be the star of my AARP meetings.” \n\n        There is another good scene between <Ed Harris> and old <E.G. Marshall>, who tells the policeman the two-way mirror was installed in the bedroom at his wife’s suggestion: “She thought I might have liked sitting there. I didn’t.” His is a poignant character, a self-made man who has spent his life giving money to charity, who has elected a president and who now fears “I’ll go out as the joke of the world.” Eastwood delivers a few nice set pieces as the suspense builds, including a rendezvous with his daughter in a public plaza while two sets of gunmen train their sights on him. \n\n        And we get hard-boiled dialogue in the Oval Office as the president and his merciless chief of staff run the coverup by ordering the Secret Servicemen to do things not covered in their job description (one is willing, one has qualms). Much depends on a hypocritical speech the president makes, which <HeroArchetype>Luther</HeroArchetype> sees at an airport bar just as he’s about to flee the country. In a classic Eastwood moment, the thief’s jaw hardens and he decides to stay and fight, rather than give a pass to a heartless liar.\n\n        Eastwood as director is usually eclipsed by Eastwood the actor; he has directed almost 20 films, good enough and successful enough to make him one of Hollywood’s top filmmakers, and yet his stardom overshadows that role. Here he creates scenes of pure moviemaking–scenes without dialogue or violence, that work only because we know the characters and because the direction, camera work (by <Jack N. Green>) and editing (by <Joel Cox>) put them together into suspenseful montages. The opening sequence is especially effective.\n\n        But at the end what I remembered most was the relationship between father and daughter. By using this personal story as an arc to draw together the other elements in the film, Eastwood does a difficult thing: He makes a <Genre>thriller</Genre> that is not upstaged by its thrills. <HeroArchetype>Luther Whitney</HeroArchetype> is a genuinely interesting, complicated character–not just an action figure. What happens to him matters to us, and that’s worth more than all the special effects in the world.\n    </Review>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key terms and segments are wrapped in the appropriate XML tags while maintaining the readability and original meaning of the article.",

Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, and written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, it is the first installment in the Shrek film series. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. In the film, an embittered ogre named Shrek (Myers) finds his home in the swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures banished by the obsessive ruler Lord Farquaad (Lithgow). With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) in exchange for regaining control of his swamp.\n\nAfter purchasing the rights to Steig's book in 1991, Steven Spielberg sought to produce a traditionally-animated film adaptation, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the project to the newly founded DreamWorks Pictures in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg, along with Williams and Aron Warner, began development on Shrek in 1995, immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was cast as the voice for the title character, recording most of the required dialogue, but died in 1997 before his work on the film was finished; Myers was hired to replace him, and gave Shrek his Scottish accent. The film was initially intended to be created using motion capture, but after poor test results, the studio hired Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation. Shrek parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily animated Disney films.[7]\n\nShrek premiered at the Mann Village Theatre In Westwood, and was later shown at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or,[5][8] making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so.[9] The film was theatrically released by DreamWorks Pictures in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed over $492 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2001. It was widely praised by critics for its animation, voice performances, soundtrack, writing and humor, which they noted catered to both adults and children. Shrek was named one of the top 10 films of 2001 by the American Film Institute, the first animated film to be listed, and won numerous accolades including the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the inaugural Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nThe film's major success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation. Three sequels have been released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two spin-off films—Puss in Boots (2011) and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)—with other productions, notably Shrek 5, in development. It is also regarded as one of the most influential animated films of the 2000s and one of the greatest animated films ever made.[10][11][12] The United States Library of Congress selected Shrek for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020, becoming the first animated film of the 21st century to be preserved.\n\n## Plot\n\nShrek is an anti-social ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp and enjoys fending off mobs and intruders. One day, his life is interrupted after the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc exiles a vast number of fairy tale creatures, who inadvertently end up in the swamp. Shrek, angered by the intrusion, visits Farquaad and demands that he move the creatures elsewhere. Shrek reluctantly allows a talkative Donkey, whom he previously saved from Farquaad's guards while fending for himself, to tag along and guide him to Duloc.\n\nMeanwhile, Farquaad is presented with the Magic Mirror, who tells him that he must marry a princess in order to become king. Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is imprisoned in a castle guarded by a Dragon. Unwilling to rescue Fiona himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the \"privilege\" of performing the task on his behalf. When Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc, Farquaad announces that whoever kills Shrek will win the tournament; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad's knights with relative ease. Amused, Farquaad proclaims them champions, and agrees to relocate the fairy tale creatures if Shrek rescues Fiona.\n\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle and the Dragon attacks them. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of romanticism; they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey from the Dragon, who is revealed to be female and has fallen in love with him. When Shrek removes his helmet and reveals he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her. Shrek carries Fiona against her will. That night, after setting up camp, and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek admits to Donkey that he is anti-social because he grew frustrated after being constantly judged for his appearance. Fiona overhears this and becomes kinder to Shrek. The next day, Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men harass the three, but Fiona easily defeats them in physical combat. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love.\n\nWhen the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogre. She explains that during her childhood, she was cursed to transform into an ogre at night but retain her human form during the day. She tells Donkey that only \"true love's kiss\" will break the spell and change her to \"love's true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an \"ugly beast\". Believing that she is talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek's abrupt hostility, Fiona reluctantly accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests that they be married today before sunset that evening. Shrek angrily dismisses Donkey and returns to his now vacated swamp but quickly realizes that he feels miserable without Fiona. A frustrated Donkey scolds Shrek for his misbehavior, and for jumping to conclusions. He even tells Shrek that Fiona was not referring to him as an \"ugly beast\", although Donkey does not reveal Fiona's secret to Shrek. The two reconcile, and Donkey summons the Dragon, whom he had reunited with earlier in the day. She rides Shrek and Donkey to Duloc so they can stop the wedding.\n\nShrek interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony ends, reveals that he has fallen for Fiona, and informs her that Farquaad is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, and Fiona transforms into an ogre in front of everyone, causing Shrek to understand Fiona's previous remarks. Disgusted and enraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona re-imprisoned, so that he will still be king by technicality. The two are saved when the Dragon, ridden by Donkey, breaks in and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona kiss, and Fiona's curse is broken; though she remains an ogre, Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with the fairy tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.\n\n## Voice cast\n\n- Mike Myers as:\n    - Shrek[13]\n    - One of the Three Blind Mice[14]\n- Eddie Murphy as Donkey[15]\n- Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona[16]\n- John Lithgow as Lord Farquaad[17]\n- Vincent Cassel as \"Monsieur\" Robin Hood[18]\n- Conrad Vernon as Gingerbread Man[19]\n- Chris Miller as:\n    - Magic Mirror[14]\n    - Geppetto\n- Cody Cameron as:\n    - Pinocchio\n    - The Three Little Pigs[14]\n- Simon J.

Williams got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg's attention and the studio decided to make it into a film.[20] Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said:\n\nEvery development deal starts with a pitch and my pitch came from my then kindergartner, in collaboration with his pre-school brother. Upon our second reading of Shrek, the kindergartner started quoting large segments of the book pretending he could read them. Even as an adult, I thought Shrek was outrageous, irreverent, iconoclastic, gross, and just a lot of fun. He was a great movie character in search of a movie.[21]\n\nAfter buying the rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active development in November 1995.[22][23] Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaptation of the book before, when he bought the rights to the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey.[24] In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him about how much the film should appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous.[25][26] Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson, although Asbury would later co-direct the sequel. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know whom to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; \"We both ended up doing a lot of everything,\" Adamson said. \"We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.\"[27]\n\nPerry in  Palo Alto (2016)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSome early sketches of Shrek's house were done between 1996 and 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek. It was also thought at one time that he would live with his parents and keep rotting fish in his bedroom.[28] Donkey was modeled after Pericles (born 1994; died 2025; also known as Perry), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park in Palo Alto, California.[29][30] Raman Hui, supervising animator of Shrek, stated that Fiona \"wasn't based on any real person\" and he did many different sketches for her. He had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors chose the final design.[31] In early development, the art directors visited Hearst Castle, Stratford upon Avon, and Dordogne for inspiration. Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina, for inspiration of Shrek's swamp.[32][33] Planned characters not used in the film include Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty.[34]\n\n### Writing\n\nThe screenplay was written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, loosely based on the picture book by William Steig. The way Steig upended fairy tale conventions in the original book by making an ogre the protagonist formed the basis for the movie being a parody of fairy tales. Elliott and Rossio began writing for the film in 1997 and worked on the project for two years. They centered the four main characters' personalities on maladaptive responses to self-esteem issues; as the DreamWorks story crew developed the plot, their personalities remained the same, ensuring the \"thematic unity\" of the story was preserved. When the studio leaned towards Shrek being a kind person shunned for being an ogre, they pushed for Shrek to remain a \"misanthropic anti-hero.\"[35][36]\n\n### Casting\n\nNicolas Cage was initially offered the role of Shrek but he turned it down because he did not want to look like an ogre. In 2013, Cage explained: \"When you're drawn, in a way it says more about how children are going to see you than anything else, and I so care about that.\"[37]\n\nMike Myers was re-cast as Shrek after Chris Farley's death.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChris Farley was initially hired to voice Shrek, and he had recorded nearly all of the dialogue for the character, but died before completing the project.[38] According to David Spade, Farley only had 5 days of voice work left to perform; Farley's brother John was asked if he would come in and finish the remaining lines, but he refused.[39] A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015.[40] DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek.[38] According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character \"for two reasons: I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [the book is] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are.\"[21]\n\nAfter Myers had completed providing the voice for the character over the course of 1999 and the film was well into production, a rough cut of the movie was shown to him in February 2000.[41] Myers asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used when she told him bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.[38] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using a Lothar of the Hill People accent and a Canadian accent.[42] After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, \"It was so good we took $4M worth of animation out and did it again.\"[43] Myers disputed the cost, saying \"it didn't cost the studio 'millions of dollars',\" as rumored. \"What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.\"[44] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits.[45] \"I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character,\" Myers said. \"And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie.\"[46]\n\nAnother person planned to voice a character in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project for unexplained reasons. Years later, Garofalo stated \"I was never told why [I was fired]. I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why. Nobody told me ... But, you know, the movie didn't do anything, so who cares?\"[47]\n\n### Animation\n\nShrek was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters.[48] Softimage was used, as well as Mental Ray.[49] A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R &amp; D, the test was finally screened in May 1997.[50] The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating \"It looked terrible, it didn't work, it wasn't funny, and we didn't like it.\"[38] The animation wasn't released publicly until 2023 when it was posted by production designer Barry E. Jackson on his YouTube channel.[51] The studio then turned to its production partners at Pacific Data Images (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998[52] and helped Shrek get to its final, computer-animated look.[38] At this time, Antz was still in production at the studio[38] and effects supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by Aron Warner \"to start development for Shrek\".[53] Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like the Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software on the market. This is particularly true with Maya, which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.[54]\n\n\"We did a lot of work on character and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation,\" Hui noted. \"In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a long time to get right.\"[55] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it did not look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators, who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.).[33] It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it could be applied to many aspects of the movie, including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and much attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.[33]\n\nShrek has 31 sequences, with 1,288 total shots.[32] Aron Warner said that the creators \"envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into\". Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations to make the world of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature. In-film locations were finalized and, as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance.[33] The animation was completed in 2000.[56]\n\n### Music\n\nShrek is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the Shrek series) to have Harry Gregson-Williams team up with John Powell to compose the score following Antz (1998) and Chicken Run (2000).[57] Powell was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Gregson-Williams due to a conflict.[58] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering.[59]\n\nShrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used pop music and other oldies to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like \"On the Road Again\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" were integrated in the film's score.[60] The band Smash Mouth's song \"All Star\" gained massive popularity after its original release two years earlier,  due to its usage in the film's opening credits.[61] The filmmakers for Shrek had originally used the song as a placeholder for the opening credits and intended to replace it with an original composition by Matt Mahaffey’s band Self that would mimic the feel of \"All Star\", named Stay Home. However, DreamWorks executive Jeffrey Katzenberg suggested for them to use \"All Star\" over the sequence instead. As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film's ending to \"go out with a big laugh\"; instead of ending the film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add a song \"I'm a Believer\" covered by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film.[62]\n\nAlthough Rufus Wainwright's version of the song \"Hallelujah\" appeared in the soundtrack album, it was John Cale's version that appeared in the film; in a radio interview, Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of \"Hallelujah\" did not appear in the film due to the \"glass ceiling\" he was hitting because of his sexuality. An alternative explanation is that, although the filmmakers wanted Cale's version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks but Cale was not.[63]\n\nThe film's 1996 animation test used the song \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\". The clip was considered lost until 2023.[64]\n\n## Cultural references\n\nIn many places, the film references classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey and he says \"I can fly\" and people around including the Three Little Pigs say \"He can fly, he can fly\"; this is a reference to Disney's Peter Pan. Donkey then says, while still flying, \"You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain't never seen a Donkey fly!\". This scene is a reference to the Disney film Dumbo.[65] The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[65] The transformation scene at the end of the film references Disney's Beauty and the Beast.[65]\n\nWhen Shrek crosses the bridge to the Castle and says, \"That'll do, Donkey, that'll do\", this is a reference to the movie Babe.[65] The scene where Princess Fiona is fighting the Merry Men is a lengthy reference to the film The Matrix.[65] At the end of the film, the Gingerbread Man, with a crutch and one leg, says \"God bless us, everyone\", which is a reference to Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol.[65]\n\nIn the scene where the Magic Mirror gives Lord Farquaad the option to marry three princesses, it parodies popular American television show The Dating Game featuring: Cinderella and Snow White.[66] In addition, Lord Farquaad's theme park style kingdom Duloc heavily mimics Disneyland, even in so far as parodying the famous \"It's a Small World\" musical ride in the scene with the singing puppets.[66] It has been suggested that Lord Farquaad himself is an unflattering parody of then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, whom producer Katzenberg reportedly dislikes.[67]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nIn 2000, IMAX released CyberWorld onto its branded large-screen theaters. It was a compilation film that featured stereoscopic conversions of various animated shorts and sequences, including the bar sequence in Antz. DreamWorks was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence's \"stereoscopic translation\", that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big-screen 3D version of Shrek. The film would have been re-released during the Christmas season of 2001, or the following summer, after its conventional 2D release. The re-release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending. Plans for this was dropped due to \"creative changes\" instituted by DreamWorks and resulted in a loss of $1.18 million, down from IMAX's profit of $3.24 million.[68][69][70]\n\nRadio Disney was told not to allow any ads for the film to air on the station, stating, \"Due to recent initiatives with The Walt Disney Company, we are being asked not to align ourselves promotionally with this new release Shrek. Stations may accept spot dollars only in individual markets.\"[71] The restriction was later relaxed to allow ads for the film's soundtrack album onto the network.[72]\n\nOn May 7, 2001, Burger King began promotions for the film, giving out a selection of nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the Shrek characters, in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders.[73] Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek's Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of Oreo Cookies 'n Cream ice cream, hot fudge, crushed chocolate cookies, whipped cream and squiggly gummy worms, and Shrek Freeze Frame Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by sunflowers. This was to support the film's DVD/VHS release.[74]\n\n### Home media\n\nShrek was released by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on VHS and DVD on November 2, 2001.[75][76] It surpassed Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace's short-lived record for being the fastest-selling DVD title of all time, selling 2.5 million copies within the first three days of release.[77] Another 4.5 million copies were sold on VHS in the same timespan, making it the biggest opening weekend in retail video since The Lion King in 1995.[77] Both releases included Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party, a 3-minute musical short film, that takes up right after Shrek's ending, with film's characters performing a medley of modern pop songs.[78] As for the DVD release, this two-disc set features a fullscreen format on the first disc and a widescreen format on the second disc, with the latter featuring a DTS audio track.[79]\n\nCoincidentally, the film was released on video the same day that Pixar's Monsters, Inc. hit theaters. Since videos were traditionally released on Tuesdays, Disney's executives did not receive this well, saying that the move \"seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film's steam\". DreamWorks responded that it \"simply shifted the release to a Friday to make it more of an event and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films.\" Monsters, Inc. earned that weekend more than $62 million, breaking the record for an animated film, while Shrek's video release made more than $100 million,[80] and eventually became the biggest selling DVD at the time with over 5.5 million sales.[81] This broke the record previously held by Gladiator, another DreamWorks film.[82] Shrek generated more than $420 million in revenue for DreamWorks on DVD and VHS, and has sold more than 21 million copies of the 23 million shipped by January 2002.[75] Worldwide, more than 10 million Shrek DVDs have been sold by that point.[75]\n\nA 3D version of the film was released on Blu-ray 3D by Paramount Home Entertainment on December 1, 2010, along with its sequels,[83] and a regular 2D Blu-ray boxset of the series was released six days later.[84]\n\nIn commemoration of the film's 20th anniversary, an Ultra HD Blu-ray edition was released on May 11, 2021, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.[85]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nShrek opened on around 6,000 screens[86] across 3,587 theaters;[87] eleven of them showed the film digitally.[88] This was the first time that DreamWorks had shown one of its films digitally.[89] The film earned $11.6 million on its first day and $42.3 million on its opening weekend, topping the box office for the weekend and averaging $11,805 from 3,587 theaters.[90] In its second weekend, due to the Memorial Day Weekend holiday, the film gained 0.3 percent to $42.5 million and $55.2 million over the four-day weekend, resulting in an overall 30 percent gain.[91] Despite this, the film finished in second place behind Pearl Harbor and had an average of $15,240 from expanding to 3,623 sites.[91] In its third weekend, the film retreated 34 percent to $28.2 million for a $7,695 average from expanding to 3,661 theaters.[92] By mid-June 2001, Shrek became the top-grossing movie of the year domestically, defeating The Mummy Returns.[93] This achievement would last until that December when it was beaten by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.[94] The film closed on December 6, 2001, after grossing $267.7 million domestically, along with $216.7 million overseas, for a worldwide total of $484.4 million.[4] Produced on a $60 million budget, the film was a huge box office smash[4] and is the fourth highest-grossing film of 2001.[95]\n\nShrek became the highest-grossing animated film ever to be released in Australia, passing the mark set by The Lion King in 1994.[96] In the United Kingdom, Shrek regained the top spot at the British box office after being beaten out the previous week by Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, earning a $20.3 million since its opening in the UK.[97]\n\n### Critical response\n\nIn addition to being an instant box office success, Shrek received wide critical acclaim.[98][99][100] 88% of 213 professional reviews of the film on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney's nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride.\"[101] Metacritic assigned Shrek a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[102] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[103]\n\nMurphy was particularly praised by reviewers for his performance as Donkey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoger Ebert praised the film, giving it four stars out of a possible four and describing it as \"jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart\".[104] USA Today's Susan Wloszczyna praised Eddie Murphy's performance, stating it \"gives the comic performance of his career, aided by sensational digital artistry, as he brays for the slightly neurotic motormouth\".[105] Richard Schickel of Time also enjoyed Murphy's role, stating \"No one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Murphy.\"[106] Peter Rainer of New York magazine liked the script, also stating \"The animation, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is often on the same wriggly, giggly level as the script, although the more \"human\" characters, such as Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad, are less interesting than the animals and creatures—a common pitfall in animated films of all types.\"[107] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote \"Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year.\"[108] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.\"[109] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote \"The witty, fractured fairy tale Shrek has a solid base of clever writing.\"[110] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A−, saying \"A kind of palace coup, a shout of defiance, and a coming of age for DreamWorks.\"[111] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel wrote \"It's a pleasure to be able to report that the movie both captures and expands upon the book's playful spirit of deconstruction.\"[112]\n\nSteven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote \"DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name to trust for imaginative, funny animated movies that delight kids and adults equally.\"[113] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design.\"[114] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication.\"[115] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass\".[116] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek.\"[117] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating \"We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it.\"[118]\n\nJohn Anderson of Newsday wrote \"The kind of movie that will entertain everyone of every age and probably for ages to come.\"[119] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote \"In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever.\"[120] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying \"Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true.\"[121] Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it \"isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages\".[120] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote \"What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies.\"[122] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote \"This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take.\"[123] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote \"The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children's book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults.\"[124] John Zebrowski of The Seattle Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes. But this is Murphy's movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one.\"[125]\n\nA mixed review came from Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune, who gave the film two and a half stars out of four and compared it to Toy Story 2, which he said \"had a higher in-jokes/laughs ratio without straining to demonstrate its hipness or to evoke heartfelt emotions\".[126] On the more negative side, Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice said he was \"desperately avoiding the risk of even a half-second of boredom\", and said \"the movie is wall-to-window-to-door noise, babbling, and jokes (the first minute sees the first fart gag), and demographically it's a hard-sell shotgun spray.\"[127] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Shrek as a \"90-minute onslaught of in-jokes\", and said while it \"strives to have a heart\" with \"a message about beauty coming from within\", \"somehow [the message] rings hollow\".[120] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, despite the film \"cunning the rendering of surfaces, there's still something flat and charmless in the digital look, and most of the pleasure rises not from the main romance but from the quick, incidental gags.\"[128]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| List of awards and nominations            | List of awards and nominations                                                           | List of awards and nominations                                   | List of awards and nominations    | List of awards and nominations    |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Ceremony                                  | Category                                                                                 | Recipient(s)                                                     | Result                            | Ref.                              |\n| American Film Institute Awards            | AFI Movie of the Year                                                                    |                                                                  | Won                               | [129]                             |\n| 74th Academy Awards[d]                    | Best Animated Feature                                                                    | Aron Warner                                                      | Won                               | [132][130]                        |\n| 74th Academy Awards[d]                    | Best Adapted Screenplay                                                                  | Ted Elliott, Roger S.

So last millennium. This decade, fairy-tale fans – and Princess Fiona – fell for a fat and flatulent Ogre. Now, that's progress.\"[144]  In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"; the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community Shrek was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the animated genre, and the only non-Disney·Pixar film in the Top 10.[145][10] Shrek was also ranked second in a Channel 4 poll of the \"100 Greatest Family Films\", losing out on the top spot to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[146] In 2005, Shrek came sixth in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Cartoons poll behind The Simpsons, Tom and Jerry, South Park, Toy Story and Family Guy.[147] In November 2009, the character, Lord Farquaad, was listed No. 14 in IGN UK's \"Top 15 Fantasy Villains\".[148] In 2006, it was ranked third on Bravo's 100 funniest films list.[149] The film's title character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.[150]\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\n\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp;amp; Villains :\n    - Shrek – Nominated Hero[145]\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs :\n    - \"I'm a Believer\" – Nominated[145]\n- AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – Nominated[145]\n- AFI's 10 Top 10 – No. 8 Animated film[145]\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nThe New York Times retrospectively described the film as \"a beloved, offbeat fairy tale whose characters and jokes continue to permeate pop culture, reaching another generation of fans.\"[98] Previous films and television shows, such as Fractured Fairy Tales and The Princess Bride, have parodied the traditional fairy tale.[151][152] Shrek had a significant impact that influenced a later generation of mainstream animated films,[152] receiving recognition for being one of the most influential from the 2000s.[151][153] Particularly after Shrek 2, animated films began to incorporate more pop culture references and end-film musical numbers.[152] Such elements can be seen in films like Robots, Chicken Little, Doogal, Ron's Gone Wrong and more recently with Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken and The Tiger's Apprentice.[152] It also inspired a number of computer animated films which also spoofed fairy tales, or other related story genres, often including adult-oriented humor, most of which were not nearly as successful as Shrek, such as Chicken Little, Happily N'Ever After, Igor, Hoodwinked!, Donkey Xote, Enchanted and its sequel Disenchanted.[152] In 2020, the United States Library of Congress selected Shrek to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[154]\n\n## Other media\n\nSeveral video game adaptations of the film have been published on various game console platforms, including Shrek (2001), Shrek: Hassle at the Castle (2002), Shrek: Extra Large (2002), Shrek: Super Party (2002) and Shrek SuperSlam (2005).[155] Shrek was also included as a bonus unlockable character in the video game Tony Hawk's Underground 2 (2004).[156]\n\nIn 2003, Dark Horse Comics released a three-issue mini-series comic book adaptation of Shrek which was written by Mark Evanier, and the issues were later compiled into a trade paperback.[157]\n\nA musical version, based on the film, with music by Jeanine Tesori and a book and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire, opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008, and closed January 3, 2010, running for a total of 441 performances.[158] It starred Brian d'Arcy James in the title role, Sutton Foster as Princess Fiona, Christopher Sieber as Lord Farquaad, Daniel Breaker as Donkey, and John Tartaglia as Pinocchio.[158] The Broadway production was recorded and released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital media.[159][160][161] A North American Tour opened July 25, 2010, in Chicago.[158] A London production opened in the West End on June 7, 2011.[162] The musical received many Tony Award nominations and won the 2009 Tony Award for Best Costume Design. It received five Laurence Olivier Award nominations including Best New Musical.[163]\n\nA shot-for-shot fan remake titled Shrek Retold was released through 3GI Industries on November 29, 2018. The project was a collaboration of 200 filmmakers and mixes live action, hand drawn animation, Flash animation, CGI and various other art forms to recreate the film. The film is available on YouTube for free.[164][165]\n\n## Future\n\nThree sequels were released over the years – the Oscar-nominated Shrek 2 in 2004, Shrek the Third in 2007, and Shrek Forever After in 2010. Shrek 2 was the only one to receive similar acclaim from critics,[166][167][168] though all three sequels were commercially successful.[169][170] Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010) were released as holiday-themed short films. A spin-off prequel film entitled Puss in Boots, centered on the titular character's life before his debut in Shrek 2, was released in 2011, while a sequel, titled Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and set after the events of Shrek Forever After, was released in 2022.[171] A fifth feature film was originally planned during the development of Shrek Forever After, but the idea was later abandoned by DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.[172][171] Leading up to NBCUniversal's planned acquisition of DreamWorks Animation in 2016, it was announced that a fifth Shrek film would be released in 2019.[173] On November 6, 2018, Variety reported that Chris Meledandri had been tasked to reboot both Shrek and Puss in Boots, with the original cast potentially returning to reprise their roles.[174][175] While cast members reported that a script was completed for a fifth Shrek film, development stalled and future plans have yet to be officially announced.[176][177] After it was reported in April 2023 that a fifth Shrek film with the original cast and a spinoff featuring Donkey was planned, Murphy said in June 2024 that he had begun voice recording sessions for Shrek 5 months ago and would begin working for the Donkey spinoff once it was finished.[178] A fifth Shrek film is scheduled to be released in 2026.[179]\n\n## See also\n\n- Shrek fandom\n- Fairy tale parody\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Donkey's ex-owner.\n- ^ This was Freeman's last film role before her death.\n- ^ A man dressed in a suit that looks like Lord Farquaad.\n- ^ At the 74th Academy Awards, Shrek was one of the first animated films to be nominated for and won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, beating Monsters, Inc. and Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.[130] It was also the first animated film to be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay.[130][131][132][133][134]\n- ^ Shrek was nominated six BAFTA Awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film; Eddie Murphy became the first, and so far, only actor to ever receive a BAFTA nomination for a voice-over performance, receiving a Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination.[137]\n- ^ Shrek is the first animated film to have entered in competition from the festival for five decades, since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to compete for the Palme d'Or.[138]\n- ^ Shrek was the first animated film to earn a PGA nomination.[143]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Shrek\".

H. Schulman, it is the first installment in the Shrek film series. \n        The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. In the film, an embittered ogre named Shrek (Myers) finds his home in the swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures banished by the obsessive ruler Lord Farquaad (Lithgow). \n        With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) in exchange for regaining control of his swamp.\n    </Summary>\n    <Development>\n        After purchasing the rights to Steig's book in 1991, Steven Spielberg sought to produce a traditionally-animated film adaptation, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the project to the newly founded DreamWorks Pictures in 1994. \n        Jeffrey Katzenberg, along with Williams and Aron Warner, began development on Shrek in 1995, immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. \n        Chris Farley was cast as the voice for the title character, recording most of the required dialogue, but died in 1997 before his work on the film was finished; Myers was hired to replace him, and gave Shrek his Scottish accent. \n        The film was initially intended to be created using motion capture, but after poor test results, the studio hired Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation. \n        Shrek parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily animated Disney films.\n    </Development>\n    <Release>\n        Shrek premiered at the Mann Village Theatre In Westwood, and was later shown at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so. \n        The film was theatrically released by DreamWorks Pictures in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed over $492 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2001. \n        It was widely praised by critics for its animation, voice performances, soundtrack, writing and humor, which they noted catered to both adults and children. \n        Shrek was named one of the top 10 films of 2001 by the American Film Institute, the first animated film to be listed, and won numerous accolades including the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the inaugural Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n    </Release>\n    <Legacy>\n        The film's major success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation. \n        Three sequels have been released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two spin-off films—Puss in Boots (2011) and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)—with other productions, notably Shrek 5, in development. \n        It is also regarded as one of the most influential animated films of the 2000s and one of the greatest animated films ever made. \n        The United States Library of Congress selected Shrek for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020, becoming the first animated film of the 21st century to be preserved.\n    </Legacy>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the key attributes of the movie \"Shrek\" while maintaining the original meaning and context.

He is the President of the United States, and a former pro wrestler and porn star. He delivers over-the-top, vulgar speeches when he addresses the nation, and gets people's attention by firing a machine gun into the air.\n\nWhen Joe Bauers' IQ test catches his attention, he makes Joe (known as \"Not Sure\") the Secretary of the Interior, expecting him to solve all of the problems facing America. To make matters worse, he expects Joe to \"do it all in one week.\" Joe manages to solve one problem: the crops aren't growing because they are watered with a sports drink called Brawndo instead of water. Joe switched the irrigation system to water and caused a massive recession, which he was blamed for, and was sentenced to one night of \"rehabilitation\", a demolition derby-style execution. Later, Camacho pardons him after he manages to prove that his plan to use water worked, and makes Joe his Vice President.\n\nHe was played by Terry Crews.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Appearance\n- 2 Personality\n- 3 History\n- 4 Trivia\n\n### Quick Answers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrior to becoming the President in Idiocracy, Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho was a professional wrestler and porn star. His leadership style was marked by dramatic speeches and the use of a machine gun to command attention.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the 2006 sci-fi comedy film Idiocracy, the President is named Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho. Before becoming President, Camacho had careers as a pro wrestler and porn star. His presidential speeches are notably vulgar and over-the-top, often capturing attention by discharging a machine gun into the air.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the 2006 film Idiocracy, President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho, a former pro wrestler and porn star, uses a distinctive method to capture the audience's attention during his speeches. He fires a machine gun into the air, delivering speeches that are often exaggerated and coarse.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the 2006 sci-fi comedy Idiocracy, President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho appoints Joe Bauers as Secretary of the Interior. Camacho, previously a pro wrestler and porn star, is recognized for his dramatic speeches and unique methods of capturing public attention.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 'Idiocracy', President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Camacho appoints Joe Bauers, or 'Not Sure', as Secretary of the Interior after his IQ test catches Camacho's attention. Camacho expects Joe to resolve America's issues. Joe does solve one problem by replacing the sports drink, Brawndo, used for irrigation with water, but this causes a recession and he is blamed for it.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\n## Appearance[]\n\nHe is an African-American descent, with a height of 6'3” feet (1.92 meters), long &amp; dark hair, and has muscular shape in his body.\n\nHe wears a white t-shirt with the US Presidential Seal printed on it, a long vest, pants and boots in an American flag pattern, and always wear a gold medal with the US Presidential Seal.\n\n## Personality[]\n\nHe doesn't want anyone to interrupt him while he is delivering the State of the Union Address in the House of Representin' by firing multiple machine gun rounds to silence congressmen who criticized him for repeating his speech. He wants to be surrounded by women around him at most times.\n\n## History[]\n\nPrior to his presidency term before the year 2505, he was a former professional wrestler (having a title of ''Five Time Ultimate Smackdown Champion'') that can be proved by his muscular shape and he was also known to have worked as an adult superstar. He had a step-brother who became the Secretary of Education during his term as President of the United States, but he's kind of stupid, though. His parents, birth date, and residence is currently unknown.\n\n## Trivia[]\n\n- In the Clevon family tree, Hank and Bobby Hill are visible. As is a dog, a monkey, a goat, Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush, and Condolezza Rice.\n- Beef Supreme is played by Andrew Wilson, who is Luke Wilson's brother.\n- Nearly all of the logos for actual present-day businesses are altered in the future. The exception is the logo for FOX News, which is the logo in use by the network at the time of this film's release.\n- Frito's last name, \"Pendejo\", is a Spanish insult which means pubic hair but conveys the same sentiment as \"dumbass\". His full name \"frito pendejo\", means fried pubic hair or \"fried dumbass\". It might also be a reference to Fritos corn chips' ill-conceived and Mexicanphobic \"Frito Bandito\" advertising character.\n\n- Categories:\n- Leaders\n- Brutes\n- False Antagonist\n- Dimwits\n- Officials\n- Comedy Heroes\n- Movie Heroes\n- Theatrical Heroes\n- Live Action Heroes\n- Infobox Update\n- Tricksters\n- Wrestlers\n- Incompetent\n- Male\n- Strong-Willed\n- Nurturers\n- Sophisticated\n- Supporters\n- Successful\n- Dreaded\n\nCommunity content is available under  unless otherwise noted.\n\n- Fantasy\n- Sci-fi\n\nAdvertisement\n\n##\n\n### Explore properties\n\n- Fandom\n- Muthead\n- Fanatical\n\n### Follow Us\n\n### Overview\n\n- What is Fandom?\n- About\n- Careers\n- Press\n- Contact\n- Terms of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Digital Services Act\n- Global Sitemap\n- Local Sitemap\n\n### Community\n\n- Community Central\n- Support\n- Help\n\n### Advertise\n\n- Media Kit\n- Contact\n\n### Fandom Apps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHeroes Wiki is a FANDOM TV Community.",

The plot follows a stuntman (Ryan Gosling) working on his ex-girlfriend's (Emily Blunt) directorial debut action film, only to find himself involved in a conspiracy surrounding the film's lead actor (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). The cast also features Hannah Waddingham, Teresa Palmer, Stephanie Hsu, and Winston Duke.\n\nThe Fall Guy premiered at SXSW on March 12, 2024, and it was released in the United States on May 3 by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, yet it underperformed at the box office, grossing $181 million worldwide against a $125–150 million production budget and losing the studio around $50 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nWorking as the stunt double for action star Tom Ryder, Hollywood stunt performer Colt Seavers breaks his back during a stunt gone wrong and abandons his career and his girlfriend, camerawoman Jody Moreno.\n\nEighteen months later, Colt, now a valet for a small Mexican restaurant, is contacted by Gail Meyer, Tom's film producer. She tells him that Jody is directing her first film, a space opera film titled Metalstorm starring Tom, and that she wants Colt to join the production in Sydney. After arriving on set, Colt learns that Jody never asked for him and is still angry about their breakup, with the film being a less-than-subtle attempt at airing her grievances at Colt.\n\nGail reveals that Tom has disappeared after getting into trouble with \"very bad people\" and she wants Colt to find him before his absence causes the already overbudget film's cancelation. Not wanting Jody's directorial debut ruined, Colt agrees. He first goes to Tom's apartment where he meets Tom's girlfriend and co-star Iggy. She gives Colt a lead, so he visits a nightclub, where he meets drug dealer Doone, who tricks Colt into drinking a cocktail laced with a hallucinogen. After getting into a fight with Doone's henchmen, Colt visits Tom's hotel room where he finds a dead body in a bathtub full of ice. When Colt returns with the police, the body has disappeared.\n\nAs the production of Metalstorm continues, Colt and Jody begin to rekindle their relationship until Gail abruptly informs him that he must return to the United States. Instead, he continues looking for Tom by tracking down his personal assistant Alma Milan. She hands him Tom's phone, which Tom and Gail had been searching for, before they are both attacked by Tom's head of security, Dressler, and his team, who are looking for the phone. Colt and Alma defeat them after an extended chase through Sydney involving a rubbish truck. He and his long-time friend Dan Tucker, the stunt coordinator on Metalstorm, unlock the phone and discover a video of an intoxicated Tom accidentally killing his most recent stunt double Henry Herrera (the man in the bathtub) while sparring at a party. The henchmen attack Colt and Dan, destroying the phone with shotgun pellets.\n\nDan escapes, but Colt is captured and brought face-to-face with Tom, who has been hiding out on a yacht on Gail's instructions. He reveals that Gail is framing Colt for the crime using deepfake technology to replace Tom's face with Colt's on the incriminating video and that he orchestrated Colt's accident because he felt that Colt was stealing the spotlight from him. Henry's body is discovered and the doctored video is released to news media, while Gail tries to convince Jody that Colt is guilty. Colt escapes and is presumed dead after a boat chase ends in an explosion, but Colt survives and swims to safety.\n\nThe next day, Tom arrives at the Metalstorm set and production continues. Colt secretly returns to the set and convinces Jody of his innocence. Together, they trick Tom into participating in a stunt sequence and confessing while he is wired with a lav mic while the rest of the stunt team, led by Dan, hold off Tom's bodyguards. Gail steals the recording at gunpoint and tries to escape in a helicopter with Tom, but Jody helps Colt leap onto the helicopter in mid-air. He retrieves the recording and falls onto a crash mat prepared by Dan, while the helicopter crashes with Gail and Tom in it.\n\nMetalstorm's trailer premieres at San Diego Comic-Con, with Jason Momoa being made the new lead and Alma the film's new producer; the film eventually becomes a box office hit. Colt is exonerated, and he and Jody get back together.\n\nIn a post-credits scene titled \"Previously On: The Fall Guy\", Gail is arrested, while Tom, trying to call his agent, accidentally triggers a series of radio-controlled pyrotechnics and blows himself up. Alma calls Momoa's agent.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Ryan Gosling as Colt Seavers, a seasoned action stuntman[9]\n- Emily Blunt as Jody Moreno, Colt's ex-girlfriend and a first-time director[9]\n- Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Tom Ryder, a famous action film star[10]\n- Hannah Waddingham as Gail Meyer, the producer of Jody's film[11]\n- Teresa Palmer as Iggy Starr, Tom's girlfriend and co-star[12]\n- Stephanie Hsu as Alma Milan, Tom's personal assistant[13]\n- Winston Duke as Dan Tucker, Colt's long-time friend and stunt coordinator[10][14]\n- Adam Dunn as Nigel, a crew member on Jody's film\n- Zara Michales as Venti Kushner, the visual effects supervisor on Jody's film\n- Ben Knight as Dressler, Tom's bodyguard\n\nAdditionally, Lee Majors and Heather Thomas, who starred as Colt Seavers and Jody Banks respectively in the original television series, reprise their roles in a mid-credits scene with Majors credited as \"The Fall Guy\",[15] while Jason Momoa has an uncredited appearance as himself.[16] Justin Eaton, who  is Ryan Gosling's stunt double in real life, portrays Henry, the stunt double who is accidentally killed.

DreamWorks Pictures had teamed up with producers Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald on the project,[18] and Martin Campbell was in talks to direct the film.[19] DreamWorks, through the Walt Disney Studios' Touchstone Pictures distribution label, was to release the film in North America, Latin America, Russia, Australia, and Asia, while Mister Smith Entertainment would have handled sales in the remaining territories. In September 2013, Dwayne Johnson was in negotiations to play the title role and McG was in talks to direct.[20]\n\nIn September 2020, Ryan Gosling, director David Leitch, and writer Drew Pearce were said to be working on an \"unnamed stuntman film\" that had been picked up by Universal Pictures.[21] In May 2022, it was confirmed this project was a film adaptation of The Fall Guy. Loosely based on the TV series, the film is produced by Universal with Leitch's 87North Productions and Gosling's Entertainment 360, with Leitch and Kelly McCormick producing alongside Gosling and Guymon Casady. Pearce is also an executive producer, as is Geoff Shaevitz.[22][10] Variety reported that the Australian Government and the New South Wales state authorities added funds to the production up to A$30 million and A$14.5 million respectively, with Paul Fletcher, Australia's Federal Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, estimating a boom to the local economy, over 1,000 Australian cast and crew, and more than 3,015 Australian film extras.[23][24]\n\nEmily Blunt was cast in August 2022.[25] Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Stephanie Hsu joined in October,[26][13] and Winston Duke, Hannah Waddingham and Teresa Palmer were cast the following month.[14][11][12]\n\nGosling and Blunt said that they took inspiration from Leitch and his producer wife, Kelly McCormick, for the romantic relationship between their characters.[27][28] Blunt's role was originally a makeup artist, but it was rewritten to be a first-time director before she received a draft of the script.[29] Blunt had some input on the character, stating that \"We all kind of built her together, because I think, maybe in the original script, she was quite severe, and that sort of tough director\"; she thought it was more interesting to see someone who is \"in a situation where they're way over their head\".[29] For the character, Blunt took some inspiration from director Greta Gerwig and several other people she had met.[29][30]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 2022 in Sydney, Australia,[31] at the Disney Studios Australia in Moore Park, Sydney.[32] Filming also took place at Sydney Harbour, Sydney Opera House, and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which was closed for several daytime hours for filming scenes involving Gosling in January 2023.[33][34] Production also filmed at Kurnell (located near Cronulla beach) as well as Martin Place, and near the Anzac Bridge in Pyrmont.[35] Variety and The Hollywood Reporter reported that the film had a production budget of $130 million.[6][7] Deadline Hollywood also stated its $130 million production cost after Australian tax credits, though added that \"some have heard the production cost was even higher at $150 [million]\".[4]\n\nThe film used practical stunts, with highly choreographed action sequences. Leitch stated, \"It was a love letter to stunts. We knew we had to be authentic in that world.\"[36] It broke a Guinness World Record for the most cannon rolls in a car, with eight and a half rolls performed by stunt driver Logan Holladay.[37][38] Cannon rolls are performed by firing a cannon-like device into the ground from a moving vehicle.\n\n### Music\n\nThe Fall Guy's score was composed by Dominic Lewis.[39] The film incorporates songs by AC/DC, Taylor Swift, Kiss, the Darkness, Phil Collins, and Blake Shelton's cover of \"Unknown Stuntman\", the theme song of the series originally performed by Lee Majors.[40][41] Yungblud covered the Kiss song “I Was Made for Lovin' You”.\n\n### Post-production\n\nEditor Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir was on set during production, returning to Los Angeles for post-production. The sound was conducted by Frankie Montano, Jon Taylor, and the team at Universal StudioPost. Visual effects studios Rising Sun Pictures, Framestore, Cinesite, Crafty Apes, Opsis and Day for Nite were involved. The bulk of VFX work was in the creation of Metalstorm, wire, and safety removal and cleanup. The digital intermediate process was led by colorist Dave Hussey at Company 3.[42]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe Fall Guy had its world premiere at SXSW on March 12, 2024.[43] It was released in Australia and New Zealand on April 24,[44] in the United Kingdom on May 2, and in the United States the following day.[45][46] Universal screened The Fall Guy at its CinemaCon panel on April 8.[47]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released digitally on May 21, alongside an extended cut version with 20 minutes of additional footage.[48] The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray Disc, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on July 23, 2024.[49]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Fall Guy grossed $92.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $88.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $181.1 million.[8][2] Variety estimated the film would need to gross $275–300 million in order to break even, and reported it would end up losing the studio $50–60 million.[50]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, The Fall Guy was released alongside Tarot, and was projected to gross $30–35 million from 4,002 theaters in its opening weekend, with some rival studios estimating it could reach $40 million.[6][7] The film made $10.5 million on its first day, including $3.15 million from preview screenings. It went on to underperform, but to top the box office, debuting at $27.7 million.[4] In its second weekend the film made $13.7 million (a drop of 51%), finishing second behind newcomer Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.[51] Vulture reported: \"The Fall Guy posted an admirable box-office hold. It dropped 50 percent in its second weekend, which is pretty great in our current, opening-weekend-focused era, especially considering that the film lost almost all its pricier premium screens to Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\"[52] It then made $8.9 million in its third weekend, finishing in fourth.[53]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Fall Guy received generally positive reviews after its SXSW premiere.[17][54][55] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 370 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: \"With action, comedy, romance, and a pair of marvelously matched stars, The Fall Guy might be the rare mainstream movie with something to entertain everyone.\"[56] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[57] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it a 90% overall positive score.[4]\n\nWriting for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico said that The Fall Guy \"feels like a pushback against all the CGI-heavy, character-less, humorless blockbusters that have been coming off the content production line\" and provides audiences \"with what too often feels like a secondary concern in big movies lately: fun\".[58] IGN called the film a \"self-reflexive love letter to Hollywood stunt work\", and praised Gosling and Blunt's performances and chemistry.[59] In the Observer, Oliver Jones opined that \"rather than indict Hollywood's worst instincts, the film instead echoes them ... If The Fall Guy reflects how Hollywood views women directors, it's little surprise there are so few of them.\"[60]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                         | Date of ceremony     | Category                                                        | Recipient(s)                                                                                | Result    | Ref.      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| AACTA Awards                                  | February 5 &amp;

Therefore, he tried to be in the left side of the screen as often as possible. He was particularly intent on doing this in the scenes with the monkey and Keira Knightley, because he didn't think anyone would look at him otherwise.\n\n- Goofs(at around 27 mins) Elizabeth Swann's maid fills a bed warmer with red-hot coals and then places the warmer at the feet of Elizabeth, who is lying in bed. That's not the way bed warmers were used. They held warm, not red-hot, coals, and were placed in bed before one turned in and removed before the sleeper lay down. If used as shown in the movie, they would have barbecued one's feet.\n\n- QuotesWill Turner: Where's Elizabeth?Jack Sparrow: She's safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised. And you get to die for her, just like you promised. So we're all men of our word really... except for, of course, Elizabeth, who is in fact, a woman.\n\n- Crazy creditsJohnny Depp's dentist got a credit for Depp's teeth.\n\n- Alternate versions Disk 2 of the DVD features 19 deleted/extended scenes:\n- Disk 2 of the DVD features 19 deleted/extended scenes:\n    - The full version of the scene where Will accidentally \"takes\" a candle off the wall.\n    - In the carriage on the way to Commodore Norrington's promotion, Governor Swann tells Elizabeth that he hopes she will demonstrate a little more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington, and that it's only through his efforts that Port Royal has become civilized.\n    - Extended scene of Port Royal when the wind makes a sudden change when the Aztec Gold \"calls.\"\n    - Extended scene of when Will helps Jack escape from Jail. Will asks Jack why to bother with the pistol, and that he could've killed him before with the single shot the pistol had if he was willing to use it. Jack then tells Will that when you've only got one shot it's best to wait for the opportune moment to use it.\n    - Before dining with Captain Barbossa, Elizabeth is putting on the purple dress and Pintel and Ragetti are spying on her through a hole in the wall. Elizabeth soon realizes this and knocks Ragetti's eye out with a poker.\n    - Extra scene of Jack and Will walking through the streets of Tortuga where continuous fighting is taking place.\n    - At Tortuga Tavern, Jack brings two drinks to Mr. Gibbs, he hesitates on which one to give him and tells him, \"Just the one,\" and Gibbs responds, \"Let's make it last then, huh?\"\n    - After Jack and Gibbs drink a toast, Will suddenly pulls out his sword, kicks over a table and the fighting in the Tavern stops. Gibbs asks Jack if Will is a bit of a stick and Jack tells him that he has no idea. The fighting in the Tavern continues, and Will inserts his sword back into its sheath.\n    - At the Isla del Muerta, Jack scans the deck of the Black Pearl with his telescope. Realizing that Elizabeth is not on board, he tells Will, \"It's begun,\" as the other pirates are running through the caves to where the hidden treasure is.\n    - Alternate and extended scene of when Jack tells the pirates that the French thought of \"Parley,\" and also invented Mayonnaise. Part of this extended scene is in the \"Blooper Reel\" on disk 2 of the DVD.\n    - Extended scene of when Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on the island. Jack makes himself at home and Elizabeth tells Jack that he was going to tell Barbossa about Will in exchange for a ship, and Jack explains how in fact he wasn't going to tell Barbossa about Will in exchange for a ship. This conversation leads to Elizabeth asking Jack how he escaped the island.\n    - Jack takes two bottles of rum onto the beach and Elizabeth asks him if there's any truth about the other stories, and Jack shows her the tattoo and the 'P' mark on his right arm, the large vein-shaped scars on his left arm and two bullet wounds on his chest, telling her that there's no truth at all. He then decides how they are going to escape the island, gives a bottle of the rum to Elizabeth and she teaches him the pirate song - after she has had a lot more to drink.\n    - Extended scene on board the Dauntless where Commodore Norrington tells Governor Swann that he insists upon rescuing Will. Elizabeth tells Norrington that the proposal was meant and that his word would not change hers, and that he is a fine man. Norrington shows his appreciation on the conditional request.\n    - On board the Dauntless, just off the shore from the Isla del Muerta, Elizabeth tells Jack that he didn't tell Will about the curse, and Jack says that he noticed she did the same, probably for the same reason. Elizabeth tells Jack that he's a smart man, but she doesn't trust him. Commodore Norrington appears, gives Jack his compass and says, \"With me Sparrow.\"\n    - Extended scene of when the pirates go underwater when Captain Barbossa gives the order, \"Take a walk.\" The pirates submerge underwater, just as the Moon appears from behind a cloud.\n    - Elizabeth boards the Pearl and Mallot and Grapple decide on what to eat first. Grapple says he was thinking cake, and Mallot sharply responds that he was thinking cake too. Grapple stabs the table with a knife and Elizabeth sees her chance to reach the deck. Mallot eyes Grapple carefully, and Grapple pushes the handle of the knife towards him, telling him to cut the cake.\n    - Jack removes his own curse and the lid of the chest slides closed by itself when Will touches it (This scene was deleted before any skeletal effects had begun so no skeletal effects are seen in this deleted scene).\n    - Extended scene just before Jack's hanging, Mr. Cotton's Parrot arrives and ejaculates on Mullroy. He tries to shake off the parrot but Murtogg stops him and says that it's good luck, then Mr. Cotton's parrot does it on him as well.\n    - Extended scene when Commodore Norrington tells Will that the sword is beautiful. He offers Will his compliments and tells Elizabeth that he wishes them both the very best of luck. Gillette asks Norrington about Jack, and he says an extra line that was cut from the film, \"Shall we prepare the Dauntless in pursuit?\" before Norrington says, \"Oh, I think we can afford to give him one day's head start.\"\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Dinosaur Planet (2003)\n\n- SoundtracksYo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\nWords by Xavier Atencio\nMusic by George Bruns\nPerformed by Lucinda Dryzek, Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp\n\n### User reviews2.4K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Bloody Brilliant!\n\nPirates of the Caribbean is a well-written, well-made, and well-acted film. Do not expect a simple action film; it is humourous and creepy, fascinating and thrilling.  Like most films, there are a couple of holes here and there in the fabric of the story; but this film wasn't made for the Oscars, it's meant to entertain and it succeeds in full at that.  It's a jolly good time with some good actors (and great Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush) and high adventure on the high seas.  Not to be missed!\n\n- rising\\_star-42\n- Jul 9, 2003\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ4\n\n- What is 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' about?\n- Is 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' based on a book?\n- How does James Norrington know Jack Sparrow's name by looking at his tattoo?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - September 11, 2003 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Hotstar\n    - Official Facebook\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Piratas del Caribe: La maldición del Perla Negra\n- Filming locations\n    - Samana, Dominican Republic\n- Production companies\n    - Walt Disney Pictures\n    - Jerry Bruckheimer Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $140,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $305,413,918\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $46,630,690\n    - Jul 13, 2003\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $654,264,546\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 23 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital EX\n    - SDDS\n    - DTS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An international co-production, the film marks Bong's English-language debut; almost 85% of the film's dialogue is in English.[13][14]\n\nThe film stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Go Ah-sung, John Hurt, and Ed Harris. It takes place aboard the Snowpiercer train as it travels a globe-encircling track, carrying the last remnants of humanity after a failed attempt at climate engineering to stop global warming has created a new Snowball Earth. Evans stars as Curtis Everett, leader of the lower-class tail-section passengers, as they rebel against the elite of the front of the train. Filming took place at Barrandov Studios in Prague, using train car sets mounted on gimbals to simulate the train's motion.\n\nSnowpiercer received critical acclaim and appeared on many film critics' top ten lists of 2014 after its international release, with praise for its vision, direction, and performances, particularly by Evans and Swinton. In the United States, the film was initially planned for a limited-screen showing but the critical response prompted The Weinstein Company to expand the showing to more theaters and to digital streaming services. With a budget of $40 million, it remains one of the most expensive South Korean productions ever.[15][16] The fourth volume of the original Snowpiercer graphic novel series, Snowpiercer: Terminus, published 2019, serves as a sequel of the film, establishing it as being set in the same continuity as the original graphic novels.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2014, an attempt to stop climate change via stratospheric aerosol injection catastrophically backfires, creating a new ice age that destroys much of life on Earth. For 17 years, the remnants of humanity shelter in a state-of-the-art self-sustaining circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\n\nUrged by his mentor Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist. For his assistance, they bribe him with Kronole, an addictive drug made from industrial waste. Namgoong also insists that his clairvoyant daughter, Yona, be freed. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress, but they face guards armed with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis sacrifices him to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender while Edgar is killed. The tail mob stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who had their children taken from them) towards the front of the train.\n\nCurtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and speculate that the ice may be thawing more and more with every year. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to celebrate the train's eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. Then the bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with automatic firearms hidden under the eggs. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, which prompts Curtis to execute Mason in turn. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is then seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong.\n\nIn the last compartment before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can now survive outside. Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, the tail section resorted to cannibalism. Edgar was an infant when Curtis killed his mother, and Curtis was going to eat him when Gilliam offered his severed arm instead, stopping the bloodshed. Curtis wants to confront Wilford for causing such horrors. Wilford's assistant, Claude, emerges from behind the engine room door to invite Curtis inside.\n\nCurtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. After ordering the execution of most of the tail section residents, Wilford offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept as Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and asks for a match. In desperation, she pulls open a floorboard to reveal Tanya's son, Timmy, working the engine as a replacement for a broken machine part, taken from his mother to be a slave. Appalled, Curtis beats up Wilford and rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the process. Andy, Andrew's missing son, crawls out of a nook and climbs into the engine core despite Curtis's pleas. Curtis gives Yona the match to light the fuse for the Kronole bomb, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who followed them. Damaged by the fighting, the door to the engine room cannot be closed, forcing Curtis and Namgoong to use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast.\n\nThe explosion triggers an avalanche that derails and wrecks the train. Curtis and Namgoong are unresponsive, so Yona and Timmy escape the wreckage. They see a polar bear in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train and did not die out as they were first led to believe.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Chris Evans as Curtis Everett \n The leader of the revolution.[17][18][19] About the character of Curtis, Evans said, \"I mean, for me, the tail section is, I think that's Curtis. I think that's who he is. The tail section is hard; it's grinding; it's tough; it's real. So that's where I had the most fun. Back there.\"[20] Casting directors suggested Evans to Bong, who initially had misconceptions of Evans before they met due to the \"caricature of the American all muscle\", but quickly departed from that notion and described Evans as \"actually very sensitive and has a quiet and introverted side. He's a very, very smart person, and he's a director.\"[21] Bong was introduced to the films Puncture and Sunshine where he described Evans's performances as showing his \"sensitive acting abilities\". Bong and Evans spent months talking about the dialogue, and Bong received help from the cast and crew including Evans due to it being his first English language film.[22] Bong said that for the role of Curtis, hiding Evans's muscular physique was the most difficult thing about working with the actor, explaining, \"He's supposed to be in the poor tail section for 17 years, eating only protein blocks, and it was tricky to hide all of that muscle mass with costume and make-up.\"[23] On whether he was surprised by the fan response, Evans said, \"I've been surprised about everything about this movie. Every movie you make, you hope people will enjoy it, but this movie has surpassed all of my expectations across the board.\"[24][25]\n- Song Kang-ho as Namgoong Minsoo \n The specialist who designed the security features on the train.[17][18][19] On taking the role, Song said, \"This was the third time I worked with director Bong, and working with director Bong is a wonderful experience.... [T]his time around, working with the wonderful cast members was a tremendous experience.\"[26][27] Describing Namgoong, Bong said, \"He sets up the ending, because he has a vision about this world that's different from Curtis's. He has a desire to go outside of the train.\"[28] On the name of the character, Bong stated, \"I was looking for a name that would be most difficult for foreigners to pronounce. Namgoong ... it is difficult. There are some name-related jokes in the film.\"[29] Song plays a character who only speaks Korean, and although as difficult as it was, he said, \"at the same time, it was very refreshing and fun to do\".[26]\n- Ed Harris as Wilford \n The creator and caretaker of the engine.[17][18] Dustin Hoffman was considered for the role.[30] About the character, Harris said, \"He's so built up, who this guy is, and then there's this big thing open, and he's just this old guy making dinner with his robe on, but director Bong really wanted him to be matter-of-fact and very mundane, and simple, and kind of freaky that way.\"[31] Harris also added that the character is \"probably a coagulation of various folks\".[31] The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role.[32] Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with \"tremendous presence and performance from the first moment that he appeared in order to convince the audience\", adding that \"[Harris] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal.\"[19] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, \"When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, but I had never seen any of them ... I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work with the guy. I'm a big fan of his.\"[33] Harris praised Bong very highly, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting.[33] Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, \"He slept with Claude, the Egghead, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his 'the One' is the Engine.\"[34] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.[35]\n- John Hurt as Gilliam \n The spiritual leader of the tail section.[17][18] Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one with the ability to \"exude the ambience of spirituality\".[19] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, \"He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is,\" adding, \"as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people.\"[36] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because \"the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches... and having to make it look like as though I'd been doing it for years.\"[37] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to \"interpret things as we want, as we see fit\" as well as adding pointers to the act.[36] Hurt said of Bong, \"I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when I got home. I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since.\"[38][39] as well as previously adding, \"He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something.... He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him.\"[40]\n- Tilda Swinton as Minister Mason \n Wilford's right hand, the second in command on the train and the spokesperson for Wilford for the past 17 years.[19][17][18] About the character, Swinton said, \"Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt we were dealing with extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket.\"[7] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, \"a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns\". Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler, and Silvio Berlusconi.[41][42] The Yorkshire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, \"was an early example of authority\".[7] Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as \"peaceful\", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, \"I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason.\"[43][44] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, \"Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously, there was something that started the whole look.\" Additionally, Swinton stated, \"As we were playing, we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts... And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [Bell] wearing Mason's breasts.\"[45][46] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondřej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who \"loved it\".[47][48] The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.[49]\n- Jamie Bell as Edgar \n Curtis's second-in-command.[19][17][18] On taking the role, Bell said, \"The reason why I wanted to be a part of the film was because of what Director Bong had to say about it; it was his vision that he brought to the table and I thought what it stood for was important to me.\"[50] When asked of performances that were interpreted differently onscreen from the screenplay, writer Masterson stated, \"[Bell] is very impish and mischievous as Edgar, which I didn't predict from his character. That might just be Jamie.\"[51] and of his performance, \"I think [Bell]'s performance, a lot of it is improvised, and quite brilliantly.\"[52] On relating to the character, Bell said, \"You know, I come from a very working-class background myself. There was the sense that I had to overcome something and really test myself. So, in a way Edgar is very similar, he genuinely doesn't have anything and he's the lowest of the low of these people.\"[50]\n- Octavia Spencer as Tanya \n A determined mother who is set on getting her son back.[17][18] Despite not possessing the qualities of a fighter, she nonetheless takes part in the rebellion and speaks for the people of the tail section.[19] The film marks Spencer's first time working in the science-fiction genre. Spencer described Bong as \"an auteur\" and expressed sadness at the studio's proposal to cut the film.[53] On imagery from the history base of references, Bong said, \"When [Spencer]'s character is being beaten by the soldier, it's meant to remind people, somewhat, of the Rodney King incident.\"[28] On the message of the film, Spencer said, \"We are all covered in smoke and dirt from years and years of not washing and particles in the air, and we are all the same color if you look at it.\"[28]\n- Ewen Bremner as Andrew \n A helpless father whose only wish is to protect his son.[17][18][54] On taking the role, Bremner said, \"I watched director Bong's film Mother which I was really knocked out by. He has a much adventurous sense of a character and he's a rare director in his route to cast actors that he really likes.\"[19] Despite the weak and frail imagery of the character of Andrew, Bong needed an actor who was able to convey the raw emotion of the character to the audience directly.[19] Bong became a fan of Bremner's after watching his appearance in Naked. On Bremner, Bong said, \"He would become an actor like Byun Hee-bong one day.\"[19]\n- Go Ah-sung (credited as Ko Asung) as Namgoong Yona \n The 17-year-old daughter of Namgoong Minsoo.[17][18] On taking the role, Go said, \"It was like going back to where it all started. Director Bong gave instructions and Mr. Song gave me advice or guidance, so it felt like I had returned to being on my first film, The Host.\"[19] About her character's name, Go said, \"[Bong] couldn't think of any name for Yona; he just left her as \"The Inuit Girl\".[26] I gave him Nastyona's album, and he went \"This is it!\" adding, \"It also matches the Biblical figure Jonah [pronounced Yona in some languages, including Korean] and had a right feel to it.\" She added that she spoke with a mixed accent of the United States, Philippines and India, and spoke to fellow cast member Ewen Bremner for advice on her English pronunciation.[55] Go described Yona as being, \"someone who was completely indifferent to Minsoo's ambition. Even if she knew, she wouldn't have cared.\"[56] Of Yona's background, Bong revealed, \"Yona's mother was the leader of the Frozen Seven's revolution—because she was an Inuit. She was confident that she could endure the coldness. However, she went out too early.\"[57]\n- Alison Pill as Teacher \n Found teaching a classroom of young students, towards the front of the Snowpiercer.[58][59]\n- Vlad Ivanov as Franco the Elder \n A seemingly indestructible henchman working for Minister Mason.[60][61]\n- Luke Pasqualino as Grey \n Gilliam's bodyguard, a muscular, agile, fast-moving warrior who is handy with knives.[62][63] On taking the role of Grey, Pasqualino said, \"I got to work with a dream cast and [Bong] who I think is frankly a genius. I feel very lucky and privileged to be given the opportunity\".[64] Grey has various tattoos on his body, each seeming having a specific story, including Gilliam's name tattooed on the heart side of his chest.[63][65] After the film's release Bong revealed background information, \"There are homosexual relationships among the men. Gilliam and Grey seem like a couple with a large age gap. Gilliam is someone whom Grey admires deeply, of course, but one could imagine they sleep together too. And Gilliam sends Grey to Curtis.\"[34]\n\nAdditionally, Adnan Hasković as Franco the Younger, an executor of the army led by Mason;[66][67] Clark Middleton as the Painter, who is often seen drawing other passengers or key events visually chronicling underclass life and death;[68] Emma Levie as Claude, Wilford's assistant who may have a relationship with Wilford;[69][70][71][72][73] Tómas Lemarquis as Egg-head, one of Wilford's agents that aids in the New Year celebration massacre;[74][75] Steve Park as Fuyu, a regimented assistant to Mason;[76][77] and Paul Lazar as Paul, one of the rebels in Curtis's army who makes the protein blocks.[78][79] The creators of the graphic novel, Jean-Marc Rochette and Benjamin Legrand, have cameo appearances in the film.[80][81][82]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nWhen I first came across Transperceneige, the first thing that grabbed my attention was the unique cinematic space of a train. Hundreds of metal pieces moving like a snake carrying people squirming inside gripped my heart. And the people were fighting against each other. They were not equal in this Noah's ark that held the last survivors as they were divided into cars.\n\nIn the winter of 2005, Bong found Jean-Marc Rochette's French graphic novel series Le Transperceneige at a comic book shop near Hongik University and finished reading the entire series while standing in front of the bookshelf where he found it.[84][85] He was fascinated by ideas of people struggling on the train for survival, and how every section is classified in social stratification. Bong showed the series to his friends, fellow director Park Chan-wook and producer Lee Tae-hun, who loved it as well.[86] Although Bong praised the original graphic novel, he soon realized that a film like Snowpiercer needed an original take. Bong stated, \"... I had to come up with a completely new story and new characters in order to create a new, dynamic Snowpiercer that was packed with cinematic exhilaration.\"[87]\n\nIn the following year, Park's production company Moho Film acquired the copyrights to the original story of Snowpiercer for Bong, and in 2007 the copyrights to the story extended. The first draft of the screenplay for Snowpiercer was completed on 15 September 2010, and in December, the second draft of screenplay was completed and modified.[88] On 4 October 2010, Bong, whilst at the Vancouver International Film Festival, had initially entertained the idea of shooting the film in Canada due to it having \"... a great infrastructure for filmmaking, and Korean expatriates are involved in the film industry a lot.\"[88] Bong wanted a film studio with a 75- to 100-meter-long space to fill with four train cars connected together. The production team travelled to Europe for studio scouting and ended up with two studio choices: Barrandov Studios in Czech Republic and Korda Studios in Hungary. In August 2011, a Czech producer hired by the production team began negotiations with two film studios for availability; Barrandov Studios was eventually chosen as the film studio and production service provider of Snowpiercer.[89][90]\n\nOn 18 January 2012, Kelly Masterson was hired to rewrite the script before it went into production due to Bong seeing his screenplay work on Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and being impressed with the tonality of darkness and acuity in the story.[91][92] Bong and Masterson had originally envisioned a romantic story for the protagonist; however they jettisoned that idea in subsequent drafts of the screenplay.[93] On 8 October 2013, at the Busan International Film Festival, Bong acknowledged the challenges in adapting such a story to fit the apparent constraints of cinema, to which had to omit certain scenes from the graphic novel, \"... I had to capture that long story in a two-hour film, so rather than cut out some scenes from the comic, I just rewrote the whole story to fit this time frame.\"[94][95]\n\nOn 13 January 2012, Chris Evans began negotiations to star in the film adaptation, and was later confirmed as the film's male lead.[96] On 17 January 2012, Tilda Swinton and Jamie Bell were confirmed to be in talks to join the project.[97] Swinton first met Bong at the Cannes Film Festival, where she was of the mind that she did not want to make any other films, a decision she takes after each film: \"And that one (and only) condition in which I will make another film is that I will have some fun.[98] So we started to play with the idea of what would amuse us about this.\" Bong and Swinton experimented with voices, mannerisms and the general appearance of the character of Mason.[99] On 18 January 2012, John Hurt was confirmed to have been cast, with Hurt stating, \"All the film crew refer to [Bong], with great reverence, as 'Director Bong'. I love the fact that I am working for Director Bong.\"[100] On 2 February 2012, Octavia Spencer had joined the cast of Bong's project in the role of a \"passenger on the train who joins the revolt in order to save her son.\"[101] Ed Harris spoke of his love of Bong Joon-ho's films and wanted to work with him, \"I want to do this. I don't care what he's asking me to do because he's a really great filmmaker.\"[102] On 27 February 2012, Ewen Bremner had joined the cast of Bong's film.[103][104][105] On 3 April 2012, Luke Pasqualino was confirmed to have joined the cast.[106][107]\n\nBong states that it took four years to develop the project, with an additional three to produce with Park.[22] Stating, \"Today, I feel I have overcome a terrible disease, like cancer cells had occupied my body during that time,\" as well as expressing an interest in making smaller films in the future.[108] The film's production countries include the Czech Republic, France, South Korea, and the United States.\n\n### Filming\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho promoting the film at the 2013 Deauville American Film Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn August 2011, the studio was determined as the shooting location, and in October 2011, Bong and his production team moved to the Czech Republic.[109][110][111] During the period of November 2011 to April 2012, the key members of the crew were secured and confirmed, those being: Ondřej Nekvasil, Eric Durst, Julian Spencer and Marco Beltrami. The preparatory production began in Tyrol, Austria during mid-March for one day to shoot some snowy scenery on the Hintertux Glacier, which made for excellent conditions and perfect weather.[112][113] On 3 April 2012, principal photography had officially begun in Prague, Czech Republic, at the Barrandov Studios on gimbals on its interconnected sound-stages after preparatory filming in the production occurred at the end of March, with a said budget near to $42 million, which was the largest film budget of all time for any film with Korean investors.[114]\n\nBong filmed Snowpiercer with 35mm film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.[115][116] Roughly ninety percent of the film was shot on set. Bong's original wish was to shoot the film entirely in Korea, but a studio large enough to accommodate a set of such scale was difficult to find, thus Barrandov Studio was used instead, requiring the construction of a 100-meter replica of the title train.[114][117] In choosing Barrandov Studio, Bong explained, \"All the artwork, huge train sets and the gimbal were greatly completed and fully operational. Shooting at Barrandov Studios will never stop with a perpetual engine.\"[118] Bong's usage of the studio allowed him and his team to carry out meticulous experiments to contrive perpetual movement by staging the film on a giant gyroscopic gimbal, which can roll from side to side or bend realistically, to give three-dimensional feel to the train.[119] Nearly all the shots within the train are filmed so that the tail sections are left of the characters on-screen, and the engine to the right; this was a \"discipline\" that Bong wanted to \"maintain that energy, and give the audience a sense that whichever way the shot is moving, that's where the characters are going\".[120]\n\nFlash SFX, the team involved in the construction of the gimbal stated, \"The main challenge of physical effects work was that of inventing and developing a system that would perfectly simulate movements of train in motion. We managed to create a massive gimbal system supporting train cars with a total weight close to 100 tons. It was capable of simulating all sideway motions and vibrations of the train, including perfect make-believe curves of railroad tracks.\"[121]\n\nOn 14 July 2012, principal photography officially wrapped in the Barrandov Studios after a 72-day shoot,[122][123] with post-production carried out in South Korea, and Bong started editing the film for its release.[123]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects company Scanline VFX worked on Snowpiercer.[124] The company worked primarily on the exterior shots of the film: the frozen city, the Yekaterina Bridge, the Frozen Harbour landscape in the sushi lounge, the \"Frozen Seven\" sequence, the industrial park in the shoot-out sequence, and the avalanche and post crash environment at the end of the film.[125] Already having multiple designs, storyboards and basic concepts of the train cars, it set in motion the development of over 60 different versions of the various wagons for the train Snowpiercer. Thus, visual effects supervisor Michel Mielke said \"... we [had] a good idea of the vision of director Bong, we saw what he liked, and what did not work for the movie.\"[125]\n\nVisual effects designer Eric Durst spoke of the Aquarium Car being an intriguing challenge of lighting, with the differentiation of a water-based environment on one side and a frozen-based landscape at the other. Durst and his team, including director of photography Alex Hong, had light \"travel through water trays on top of the aquarium structure.\"[124] Durst added that \"These refracted the light spilling on the actors, replicating the way light would react in an actual aquarium environment.\" In the task of creating that world, Mark Breakspear and his team in Vancouver spent a great amount of time at the Vancouver Aquarium to study \"the fish, the lighting environments, the way the light refracted through the water and glass, along with how it distorted the fish as they passed.\"[124]\n\nAmong the most challenging effects on the train was the length of the train and the number of cars that needed to be handled. Mielke had a \"very complex rig\" created and built to provide the animators involved in the creating process with enough capability as was possible. He stated, \"The rig managed that the train automatically followed the rails, that the motion of the wagons where simulated depending on the rails, that the wagons could be changed easily and so on.\"[125]\n\nParallel to principal photography in Prague, the first designs of visuals spanned from May 2012 up until the final shots of early March 2013, with a team of over 70 artists developing over 186 VFX-shots with almost 50 being full of computer-generated imagery.[125]\n\n### Design\n\n#### Costume design\n\nCostume designer Catherine George explained that Mason was initially inspired by a Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondřej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst a room full of dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood.[126] In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late sixties and early seventies, adding that, \"... a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and scoff at people who were less better off, a bit of a Margaret Thatcher type, really.\"[127] George also designed Minister Mason's suit to look \"a typical conservative politician shape and style\" with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire.[127] She had \"collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals\" to experiment with the designs of such a character.[128] George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional.[128] George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with \"a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth\" and played with costuming ideas for Swinton's Minster Mason character.[126]\n\nOn creating individuality for the passengers in the tail section, George had the designs come from random materials they would use to fashion practical clothing, \"The tail section clothing was pieced together from different garments and repairs were made on top of that. They had to improvise with any materials that were left on the train.\"[127] For the design of Curtis, Bong and George wanted him to be anonymous but at the same time recognizable. The design was difficult as George had to conceal Evans's muscular physique and muscle mass thus, \"We had to cut out the sleeves of his under layers to help him look leaner.\"[129]\n\nGeorge personally designed the costumes for Nam and Yona, who wear the \"darker-coloured intense black\".[128] Taking inspiration from photographs of train engineers from an early industrial period and vintage French railway jackets, it was designed while she looked at utilitarian clothes due to Nam previously being a train engineer before his imprisonment. George also designed many of the tail section costumes, including Nam's, using Japanese Boro fabric.[127]\n\nIn creating Claude's yellow coat and dress, George was mindful of the fact it was the first colour of brightness in the tail section scene, as well as the property of yellow being the most luminous colour in the spectrum.[127] She expressed, \"It's the colour that captures our attention more than any other and in colour psychology yellow is non-emotional and lacking compassion.\" Camera testing occurred before deciding the final colours as well as observing how they'd interact, with the back drop of darker costume colours.[127]\n\n#### Production design\n\nBong and his illustrators created various pieces of concept art for the train cars of Snowpiercer, led by Czech production designer Ondřej Nekvasil, who was brought onto the production team to help realize those visions.[87][130] Nekvasil approached the atmosphere of the tail section it as if it were a \"dark, monochromatic ... life\", emphasising poor living arrangements, to which he found inspiration from poor areas of Hong Kong and elsewhere to put in the set designs. In order to make the colours appear \"used\" and \"dirty\", Nekvasil and company started with colourful props that were subsequently washed out and forcibly aged to create a feeling of \"really used property and space\", while creating a back story to justify the appearance.[130]\n\nWhen designing the train, Nekvasil and Bong hit upon the idea of the train not being designed by one man in one specific moment; the idea that \"these various train cars were built in different periods of Wilford's life\".[131][132] Another idea was the logical scale of the train itself, though Bong entertained the notion of it being beyond a logical scale, Nekvasil stated, \" ... if it's 20 feet [6 m] wide, it'll no longer seem like a train.\"[132] Dimensions and sizes were discussed, and the design sized finalised was \"slightly bigger than a typical train\", though enough to allow space for camera movement inside the train. The design was difficult due to distance limitations, as Nekvasil said, \"... the biggest stage we had, which was about 300 feet [90 m] long, was not big enough to fit everything.\"[132]\n\nInstead of overly relying on CGI, Nekvasil's production design team constructed twenty-six individual train cars and used a giant gyroscopic gimbal in Prague's Barrandov Studios to simulate the movement of an actual train when shooting.[133][134] Bong stated that the gimbal was used on the third day of shooting, explaining, \"Sometimes we felt carsick on set,\" due to the realistic effects of the gimbal.[133]\n\n#### Sound design\n\nSound engineers Anna Behlmer, Terry Porter and Mark Holding mixed the sound for Snowpiercer, supervised by sound editor Taeyoung Choi.[135]\n\n### Music and soundtrack\n\nIn May 2012, Marco Beltrami was hired to compose the incidental music for Snowpiercer.[136] In January 2013, a song titled Yona Lights was released on the film's official website in South Korea.[137] In July 2013, during the 007 Fimucité at Tenerife International Film Music Festival in the Canary Islands, a few pieces of the three films composed by Beltrami (Snowpiercer, Soul Surfer and The Wolverine) were selected for the performance.[138]\n\nThe film's official soundtrack was released in August 2013 in South Korea and the international release date was on 9 September 2013.[139]\n\n## Release\n\nSnowpiercer premiered at the Times Square on 29 July 2013 in Seoul, South Korea,[140] before screening at the Deauville American Film Festival as the closing film on 7 September 2013,[141] the Berlin International Film Festival as the part of Berlin's Forum sidebar on 7 February 2014,[142] opening the Los Angeles Film Festival on 11 June 2014,[143] and the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 22 June 2014.[144]\n\n### Cutting request\n\nOn 9 November 2012, The Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights to Snowpiercer from CJ Entertainment based on the script and some completed footage, with a plan for wide release in North America, as well as throughout the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[145] It was released in the United States on 27 June 2014 in just eight theaters in selected cities.[146] This delay was caused by Harvey Weinstein, an owner of The Weinstein Company, requesting 25 minutes of footage be cut, asking for less dialogue and more action,[147] and a voice-over sequence at the end of the film.[148] The fish-gutting scene was one that Weinstein was adamant about removing, but Bong lied to Weinstein, claiming his father was a fisherman and the scene was in tribute to his father, to get Weinstein to agree to keep it.[147] Weinstein screened his cut to a test audience of around 250 members. In response to the poor score given by the test audience, Weinstein said to Bong they needed to cut more.[147] In a later test screening of Bong's original cut of the film, the audience's score was \"much higher\".[148] Following the news of the cut, a Free Snowpiercer petition campaign demanding the director's cut of the film to be released in the US was created by cinema activist Denise Heard-Bashur,[149] with support from the film's stars Tilda Swinton and John Hurt.[147] Bong's uncut version of the film was eventually released,[150] but with the caveat that the film switched distributors to Radius-TWC, resulting in a limited release in art house cinemas.[147] On 3 July 2014, it was announced that thanks to positive reviews, Snowpiercer would get a wider US release and play in over 150 theaters.[151][152]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in various countries, including France and Korea, over Q3 and Q4 first, before the movie was finally debuted in North American theaters. The film was eventually released on home media in North America by Starz's Anchor Bay Entertainment through The Weinstein Company Home Entertainment on 21 October 2014,[153] and became available on Netflix for streaming on 1 November 2014.[citation needed] It did not get a genuine UK release until November 2018, when it was made available digitally via Amazon Prime Video and was released on DVD &amp; Blu-ray in 2020. A 4K restoration of the film is scheduled to be released on Blu-ray and digitally on January 14, 2025, by Lionsgate.[154]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nBetween its South Korean opening on 27 June 2014 and 23 October 2014, the film earned US$86.7 million worldwide.[155] As of April 2014[update], it was the tenth highest-grossing domestic film in South Korea with 9.35 million admissions. The film holds the domestic record for the fastest movie (domestic and foreign) to reach four million admissions, which it achieved in its fifth day after premiere, and another record for the highest weekend figure (from Friday to Sunday) for a Korean film, with 2.26 million viewers.[156] The film took in $171,000 on its US opening weekend, averaging around $21,400 per theater.[157] The film grossed US$59.8 million in South Korea and its largest international market was China, with $11.1 million.[158]\n\n### Critical response\n\nFilm review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 94% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 267 reviews with an average score of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Snowpiercer offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacle for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters.\"[159] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be \"universal acclaim\".[160]\n\nChris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the piece an \"A\" rating, stating, \"Snowpiercer sucks you into its strange, brave new world so completely, it leaves you with the all-too-rare sensation that you've just witnessed something you've never seen before ... and need to see again.\"[161]\n\nA. O. Scott wrote, in his review for The New York Times, \"Planetary destruction and human extinction happen a half-dozen times every summer. It's rarely this refreshing, though.\"[162] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian scored the film most positively, writing, \"Snowpiercer works brilliantly, the sum of extremely disparate parts that adds up to cinematic excellence.\"[163] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York scored the film five out of five stars, writing, \"Sprung from a 1982 French graphic novel and bearing its era's trickle-down tensions, Snowpiercer is a headlong rush into conceptual lunacy—but you'll love it anyway.\" Rothkopf praises Joon-ho, stating, \"... Bong grabs onto the grungy conventions of postapocalyptic adventure with relish. He serves up claustrophobic action scenes (one largely shot in the dark) and ominous, messianic overtones as the band of rebels makes its way forward.\"[164]\n\nLou Lumenick of The New York Post gave the film high acclaim, writing, \"Don't miss it—this is enormously fun visionary filmmaking, with a witty script and a great international cast.\" He added, \"The beautifully designed train is one of the most memorable in screen history ...\"[165] David Denby of The New Yorker spoke highly of the piece, stating it to be, \"Violent, often absurd, but full of brilliant surprises, while Bong keeps the center of the action moving toward the front of the train, a considerable feat of camera placement, choreographed mayhem, and cohesive editing\", and praising Nekvasil's production design, \"Bong and [Nekvasil], provide them with a series of sybaritic astonishments.\"[166]\n\nClarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a highly positive review, commenting, \"Snowpiercer is still an intellectually and artistically superior vehicle to many of the end-of-days futuristic action thrillers out there.\" Speaking highly of Bong's film-making, Tsui wrote, \"Bong's vivid depictions—aided by Ondřej Nekvasil's production design, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography and Steve M. Choe's editing—are exceptional.\"[1] David Thomson of The New Republic remarked that \"The most bracing and liberating thing about Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer is not just its lyrical forward motion, but the exuberance with which the film revels in its plot predicament.\" He furthers praises Nekvasil's \"progression of design set-pieces\" and Tilda Swinton's performance, saying \"She is the life and soul of this riotous party, and you will be sad to see her disposed of, no matter that Mason's ghastly manner has earned it.\"[167] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, \"An enormously ambitious, visually stunning and richly satisfying futuristic epic from the gifted Korean genre director Bong Joon-ho.\" Foundas added that Beltrami's original score was \"among the generally impeccable craft contributions [to the film]\".[168]\n\nJames Rocchi of Film.com wrote that, \"If the film has one element that never flags or falters, it's Evans.\"[169]\n\nSome were more critical of the film. Jordan Adler of We've Got This Covered wrote \"We leave Snowpiercer more exhausted with questions than invigorated by its unique vision and style. It is a formidable example of directorial control bogged down by poor writing, half-finished effects work and a rather thin exploration of a fascinating dystopian universe.\"[170] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post found otherwise potentially good acting to be \"virtually lost in a tonal mishmash that can never decide between thoughtful political metaphor, lightheartedness and pulverizing violence\" and went on to describe the director's \"tiresome, slow-motion fetishism, mixing costumes and weaponry in an effort to distract from the scenes' sheer repetitiveness.\"[171]\n\n### Critics' top ten lists\n\nIn 2020, Snowpiercer was ranked by The Guardian number 8 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema.[172] The film appeared on several critics' lists of the top ten best films of 2014.[173]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                                     | Date of ceremony    | Category                                | Recipients                                                                                      | Result    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists[174]                   | 12 January 2015     | Best Supporting Actress                 | Tilda Swinton                                                                                   | Won       |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Director                           | Bong Joon-ho                                                                                    | Won       |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Supporting Actor                   | Song Kang-ho                                                                                    | Nominated |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Supporting Actress                 | Tilda Swinton                                                                                   | Nominated |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Cinematography                     | Hong Kyung-pyo                                                                                  | Nominated |\n| Asia-Pacific Film Festival[175]                           | 13 December 2013    | Best Editing                            | Steve M.

Principal photography began on 19 February 2009, and was completed on 12 June 2010,[6] with reshoots taking place in December 2010.\n\nPart 2 was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 July 2011, and is the only Harry Potter film to be released in 3D.[7] It was a commercial success and one of the best-reviewed films of 2011, with critics deeming it a satisfying conclusion to the saga while praising its visual effects, cinematography, musical score, action sequences, direction, and performances.[8][9][10][11][12][13] At the box office, the film claimed the worldwide opening weekend record, earning $483.2 million, as well as setting opening day and opening weekend records in various countries. Part 2 grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and became the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[14] and the highest-grossing film of 2011.[15][16] It is currently the highest-grossing film in the Harry Potter series as well as in the Wizarding World franchise. The National Board of Review named Deathly Hallows – Part 2 one of the top-ten films of 2011. It was nominated for three awards at the 84th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n## Plot\n\nAfter burying Dobby, Harry Potter asks the goblin Griphook to help him, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting a Horcrux is there. Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry when he took it from Draco. A horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realises a Horcrux connected to Rowena Ravenclaw is hidden at Hogwarts. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade and Aberforth Dumbledore helps them, revealing that he was the one who sent Dobby to Malfoy Manor. He then reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, where Neville Longbottom guides them.\n\nSeverus Snape threatens any staff or students aiding Harry. During a duel, Snape flees from Professor McGonagall, who then rouses Hogwarts for battle. Luna Lovegood advises Harry to consult Helena Ravenclaw's ghost. Helena reveals Voldemort used dark magic on her mother's diadem, which is hidden in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. Meanwhile, Draco, Blaise, and Goyle attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts an uncontrollable Fiendfyre curse that kills him, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione rescue Malfoy and Zabini and escape on brooms. Outside, Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the fire. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry realises Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. The trio overhears Voldemort telling Snape the Elder Wand cannot serve him until Snape dies. Nagini attacks Snape as he dies, giving Harry one of his memories. Many members of the Order, students, and staff, including Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks, are killed in the battle at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry views Snape's memory in the Pensieve: Snape and Harry’s mother Lily were childhood friends; he was also in love with her, but she fell for Harry’s father James, whom Snape despised for his arrogance and for bullying him.  Following her death, Snape worked with Albus Dumbledore as a double agent amongst the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him. Snape conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he inadvertently became a Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the Resurrection Stone that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry summons the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus. They comfort him before he surrenders to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who awakens in limbo. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that Harry is now free of Voldemort, and can choose to return to his body or move on. Harry chooses the former.\n\nVoldemort displays Harry's corpse and demands Hogwarts surrender. As Neville takes the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is alive, and the Malfoys abandon Voldemort. Ron's mother, Molly Weasley, kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall, and Neville beheads Nagini, destroying the last horcruxes. Harry defeats Voldemort when his Expelliarmus deflects Voldemort's Killing Curse back at him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Voldemort never commanded the Elder Wand; it recognised him as its true master after disarming Draco, who had previously disarmed Dumbledore. Instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry chooses to destroy it.\n\nNineteen years later, Harry and Ginny Weasley, now married, watch as their youngest son leaves on the train at King’s Cross to Hogwarts alongside Ron, Hermione and their two children.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter: A 17-year-old British wizard.\n- Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley: One of Harry's best friends.\n- Emma Watson as Hermione Granger: One of Harry's best friends.\n- Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange: A Death Eater and Sirius Black's cousin and murderer.\n- Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid: Harry's half-giant friend and a former member of staff at Hogwarts.\n- Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick: The Charms master and Head of the Ravenclaw house at Hogwarts; and also as Griphook, a goblin and former employee at Gringotts Bank.\n- Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort: A twisted, evil, power-hungry, powerful wizard, and the founder and supreme leader of the Death Eaters.\n- Michael Gambon as Professor Albus Dumbledore: The late headmaster of Hogwarts.\n- John Hurt as Garrick Ollivander: A wandmaker abducted by the Death Eaters.\n- Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy: Draco Malfoy's father and a disgraced Death Eater.\n- Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy: Draco's mother and Bellatrix's sister.\n- Gary Oldman as Sirius Black: Harry's late godfather.\n- Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape: Former Head of the Slytherin House and Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and the new headmaster of Hogwarts.\n- Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall: The Transfiguration teacher and the Head of the Gryffindor house at Hogwarts.\n- David Thewlis as Remus Lupin: A werewolf, member of the Order of the Phoenix and a former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.\n- Julie Walters as Molly Weasley: The Weasley matriarch.\n- Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy: A Death Eater and son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.\n- Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley: Ron's younger sister and Harry's love interest.\n- Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom: A schoolfriend and strong supporter of Harry Potter.\n- Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood: A seemingly dotty schoolfriend of Harry, who provides wise counsel at key moments.\n\nIn the book, a significant number of characters who have not appeared since some of the earlier novels reappear to defend Hogwarts in the large, final battle.[17] Director David Yates stated, \"I want to get them all back\", referring to his desire to bring back as many actors who have appeared in the franchise as possible for that climactic battle sequence in the film. Resultantly, several actors reprise their roles from previous Harry Potter films including Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood, Devon Murray as Seamus Finnigan, James and Oliver Phelps as Fred and George Weasley, Jessie Cave as Lavender Brown, Afshan Azad as Padma Patil, Anna Shaffer as Romilda Vane, Isabella Laughland as Leanne, Georgina Leonidas as Katie Bell, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Freddie Stroma as Cormac McLaggen, Chris Rankin as Percy Weasley, Alfred Enoch as Dean Thomas, Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn, Gemma Jones as Poppy Pomfrey, Miriam Margolyes as Pomona Sprout, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Natalia Tena as Nymphadora Tonks, George Harris as Kingsley Shacklebolt, Josh Herdman as Gregory Goyle, Scarlett Hefner as Pansy Parkinson, Louis Cordice as Blaise Zabini, Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Adrian Rawlins as James Potter, and Leslie Phillips as The Sorting Hat.\n\nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film. For example, Ciarán Hinds assumed the role of Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother and bartender of the Hog's Head inn.[18] For the final scene in the film which is set nineteen years after the film's main story, the actors playing the main characters were made to look older through the use of makeup and special effects.[19] After the initial look of the actors' aged appearances leaked onto the Internet, some fans reacted by opining that Radcliffe and Grint looked too old, while Watson did not appear significantly different at all. After primary filming concluded in June 2010, Yates examined the footage, and concluded that the problem could not be resolved through editing or CGI, and had the sequence re-shot that December, with redesigned makeup.[20]\n\n## Production\n\n### Filming\n\nSt Pancras serves as the opening shot of the film's final scene, \"nineteen years later\".\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPart 2 was filmed  back-to-back with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 from 19 February 2009 to 12 June 2010,[21][22] with reshoots for the epilogue scene taking place at Leavesden Film Studios on 21 December 2010.[23] Yates, who shot the film with director of photography Eduardo Serra, described Part 2 as \"operatic, colourful and fantasy-oriented\", a \"big opera with huge battles\".[24][25]\n\nOriginally set for a single theatrical release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to, what David Heyman called, \"creative imperative\". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, \"No, David. How are we going to do it?\". After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.[26]\n\n### Sets\n\nIn an interview with Architectural Digest, production designer Stuart Craig remarked on creating sets for Part 2. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\"[27]\n\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, the entrance of the Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really – maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white – so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\"[28]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Burke said that \"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\" He went on to say: \"It's taken two years – getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas.\"[29]\n\nOn the quality of 3D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, \"I think it's good, actually. I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CGI, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\" Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3D conversion, saying that \"The way David Yates is approaching 3D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way.\"[30][31]\n\nIn 2012, the visual effects in the film were nominated for an Oscar. The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects at the 65th BAFTA Awards in 2012.\n\n### Music\n\nIt was originally planned that John Williams, who composed the scores for the first three instalments, would return to compose the final film's score, but he was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.[32] It was confirmed that the composer for Part 1, Alexandre Desplat, was set to return for Part 2.[33] In an interview with Film Music Magazine, Desplat stated that scoring Part 2 is \"a great challenge\" and that he has \"a lot of expectations to fulfill and a great deal of work\" ahead of him.[34] In a separate interview, Desplat also made note that Williams's themes will be present in the film \"much more than in Part 1\".[35] The soundtrack for the film was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[36]\n\n## Marketing\n\nIn March 2011, the first preview for Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was released, revealing new footage and new interviews from the starring cast.[37] The first United States poster was released on 28 March 2011, with the caption \"It All Ends 7.15\" (referring to its international release date).[38] On 27 April 2011 the first theatrical trailer for Part 2 was released. The trailer revealed a range of new and old footage.[39] The IMAX trailer for the film was released with IMAX screenings of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides on 20 May 2011. During the MTV Movie Awards on 5 June 2011, Emma Watson presented a sneak peek of the film.[40]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint at the premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 on 7 July 2011 at Trafalgar Square in London.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn 2 April 2011, a test screening of the film was held in Chicago, with Yates, Heyman, Barron and editor Mark Day in attendance.[41] The film had its world premiere on 7 July 2011 at Trafalgar Square in London.[42] The United States premiere was held in New York City at Lincoln Center on 11 July 2011.[43] Although filmed in 2D, the film was converted into 3D in post-production and was released in both RealD 3D, IMAX 3-D and 4DX.[44]\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to open in Indonesia on 13 July 2011.[45] The Indonesian government levied a new value added tax on royalties from foreign films in February 2011, causing three film studios, including Warner Brothers, to halt the importation of their films, including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 into the country.[45] The film was not released to cinemas in the Kingdom of Jordan due to recently enforced taxes on films.[46]\n\nOn 10 June, one month before release, tickets went on sale.[47] On 16 June 2011, Part 2 received a 12A[48] certificate from the British Board of Film Classification, who note that the film \"contains moderate threat, injury detail and language\", becoming the only Harry Potter film to receive a warning for \"injury detail\". At midnight 15 July, Part 2 screened in 3,800 theaters. In the United States, it played in 4,375 theaters, 3,100 3D theaters and 274 IMAX theaters, the widest release for an IMAX, 3D, 4DX and Harry Potter film.\n\n### Home media\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was released on 11 November 2011 in the United States in four formats: a one-disc standard DVD, a two-disc standard DVD special edition, a one-disc standard Blu-ray, and three-Disc Blu-ray 2D Combo Pack (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy).[49] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film was released on 2 December 2011 in three formats: a two-disc standard DVD, a three-disc Blu-ray 2D Combo Pack (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy), and a four-disc Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray 2D + DVD + Digital Copy).[50] The film set the record for fastest-selling pre-order DVD and Blu-ray on Amazon.com, just two days into the pre-order period.[51]\n\nDeathly Hallows – Part 2 sold 2.71 million Blu-ray units ($60.75 million) in three days (Friday to Sunday).[52] It also sold 2.83 million DVD units ($42.22 million) during its debut.[53] By 18 July 2012 it had sold 4.71 million Blu-ray units ($99.33 million)[54] and 6.47 million DVD units ($88.96 million).[55]\n\nOn 28 March 2017, Deathly Hallows – Part 2 made its Ultra HD Blu-ray debut, along with Deathly Hallows -

This means only $72.8 million of the opening-weekend grosses originated from 3-D showings, the second-largest number at the time.[60]\n\nIt also scored the largest three-day[93] and four-day gross,[94][95] the sixth-highest-grossing opening week (Friday to Thursday) with $226.2 million,[96] and even the seventh-largest seven-day gross.[97] It fell precipitously by 84% on its second Friday[98] and by 72% during its second weekend overall, grossing $47.4 million, which is the largest second-weekend drop for any film that opened to more than $90 million.[99] Still, it managed to become the fastest-grossing film in the franchise and also achieved the second-largest ten-day gross ever at the time (now eighth).[100] In its third weekend, the movie surpassed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to become the highest-grossing film of the franchise in the US &amp; Canada.[101]\n\n#### Other territories\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 became the third-highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing 2011 film, the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film and the highest-grossing Harry Potter film.[102] On its opening day, Deathly Hallows – Part 2 grossed $43.6 million from 26 countries, placing it 86% ahead of Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and 49% higher than Half-Blood Prince. From Wednesday until Sunday, on its 5-day opening weekend, it set an opening-weekend record outside the US and Canada by earning $314 million.[103][104] The average 3D share of Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was 60%, which was lower than the 3D share for Transformers: Dark of the Moon (70%) and On Stranger Tides (66%).[105] On its second weekend, it held to the top spot, but fell precipitously by 62% to $120.2 million despite minor competition. This amount is about the same as what On Stranger Tides made from its second weekend ($124.3 million).[106] Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was in first place at the box office outside North America for four consecutive weekends.[107][108]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta it brought in a record $14.8 million on its first day.[109] On its opening weekend it earned £23,753,171 in the United Kingdom, marking the second largest opening weekend in 2011. Its performance did not surpass that of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 2004, which earned £23,882,688 on its opening weekend.[110] In United States dollars, its opening weekend was an all-time record $38.3 million, ahead of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($33.5 million).[111] The film also achieved the largest single-day gross on its first Saturday[110] and the largest opening week with $57.6 million.[112] The film made a total of £73.1 million ($117.2 million) at the United Kingdom box office,[113] making it the tenth-highest-grossing film.[114] It also is the highest-grossing film of 2011 and the highest-grossing Wizarding World film.[115]\n\nDeathly Hallows – Part 2 also set opening-day records in Mexico ($6.1 million), Australia ($7.5 million), France and the Maghreb region ($7.1 million), Italy ($4.6 million), Sweden ($2.1 million), Norway ($1.8 million), Denmark ($1.6 million), the Netherlands ($1.7 million), Belgium ($1.4 million), the Czech Republic ($2.0 million), Argentina ($961,000), Finland ($749,000) and Hong Kong ($808,000).[57][116][117][118] It also established new Harry Potter opening-day records in Japan ($5.7 million), Brazil ($4.4 million), Russia and the CIS ($4.2 million), Spain ($3.3 million) and Poland ($1.25 million).[109]\n\nDeathly Hallows – Part 2 set opening day records in India with ₹15 crore ($3.41 million),[119] Australia with $19.6 million, New Zealand with $2.46 million,[120] Brazil with $11. million,[121] Scandinavia with $18.5 million, Mexico with $15.9 million[121][122] and many other Latin American and European countries.[57][123]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 332 reviews, with an average score of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying – and suitably magical – conclusion.\"[124] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, the film has a score of 85 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[125] The film received a score of 93 from professional critics at the Broadcast Film Critics Association; it is the organisation's highest-rated Harry Potter film.[126] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[127]\n\nPhilip Womack in The Daily Telegraph commented, \"This is monumental cinema, awash with gorgeous tones, and carrying an ultimate message that will resonate with every viewer, young or old: there is darkness in all of us, but we can overcome it.\" He further expressed that David Yates \"transmutes [the book] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle.\"[128] Another review was released on the same day from Evening Standard, who rated the film four out of five and stated \"Millions of children, parents, and those who should know better won't need reminding what a Horcrux is – and director David Yates does not let them down. In fact, in some ways, he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book.\"[129] The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases \"a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil\".[130]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four and said, \"The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.\"[131] Mark Kermode from the BBC said that the film is a \"pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book\", but he criticised the post-converted 3D.[132] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film three and a half out of four and said \"While Deathly Hallows: Part 2 offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with you after the final chapter has closed.\"[133] Richard Roeper, also from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film an A+ rating and said: \"This is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film.\"[134]\n\nIn one of the few negative reviews, Brian Gibson of Vue Weekly described the film as \"deadly dull\" and a \"visual overstatement\".[135] Other reviews criticised the decision to split the novel into two cinematic parts, with Ben Mortimer of The Daily Telegraph writing \"Deathly Hallows – Part 2 isn't a film. It's HALF a film ... it's going to feel somewhat emotionless.\" Other critics wrote of the film's runtime; Alonso Duralde from The Wrap said, \"If there's one substantial flaw to the film, it's that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time.\"[136] Rebecca Gillie of The Oxford Student gave the film two out of five and wrote: \"At the end of [the film] there is nothing that stays with you once you've left the cinema.\"[137]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 84th Academy Awards, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 received nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects.[138][139] Its other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and four Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[140][141][142][143] The National Board of Review named Deathly Hallows – Part 2 one of the ten best films of 2011.[144]\n\n## Future\n\nIn July 2016, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. applied to purchase the rights to the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a follow-up to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, leading to speculation that the stage play was being planned to be adapted into a film.[145][146]\n\nIn November 2021, Chris Columbus, who directed the first two instalments of the film series, expressed interest in directing an adaptation of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, with the intent of having the main cast members reprise their roles.[147][148][149][150] In March 2022, when The New York Times asked Radcliffe whether he would return to his role as Harry Potter, he replied that he was not interested at the moment, but did not deny the possibility of returning to the role in the future.[151][152]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (12A)\".

Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry when he took it from Draco. A horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realizes a Horcrux connected to Rowena Ravenclaw is hidden at Hogwarts. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade and Aberforth Dumbledore helps them, revealing that he was the one who sent Dobby to Malfoy Manor. He then reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, where Neville Longbottom guides them.\n    </Plot>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    Severus Snape threatens any staff or students aiding Harry. During a duel, Snape flees from Professor McGonagall, who then rouses Hogwarts for battle. Luna Lovegood advises Harry to consult Helena Ravenclaw's ghost. Helena reveals Voldemort used dark magic on her mother's diadem, which is hidden in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. Meanwhile, Draco, Blaise, and Goyle attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts an uncontrollable Fiendfyre curse that kills him, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione rescue Malfoy and Zabini and escape on brooms. Outside, Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the fire. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry realizes Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. The trio overhears Voldemort telling Snape the Elder Wand cannot serve him until Snape dies. Nagini attacks Snape as he dies, giving Harry one of his memories. Many members of the Order, students, and staff, including Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks, are killed in the battle at Hogwarts.\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    Harry views Snape's memory in the Pensieve: Snape and Harry’s mother Lily were childhood friends; he was also in love with her, but she fell for Harry’s father James, whom Snape despised for his arrogance and for bullying him. Following her death, Snape worked with Albus Dumbledore as a double agent amongst the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him. Snape conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he inadvertently became a Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the Resurrection Stone that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry summons the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus. They comfort him before he surrenders to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who awakens in limbo. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that Harry is now free of Voldemort, and can choose to return to his body or move on. Harry chooses the former.\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    Voldemort displays Harry's corpse and demands Hogwarts surrender. As Neville takes the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is alive, and the Malfoys abandon Voldemort. Ron's mother, Molly Weasley, kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall, and Neville beheads Nagini, destroying the last horcruxes. Harry defeats Voldemort when his Expelliarmus deflects Voldemort's Killing Curse back at him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Voldemort never commanded the Elder Wand; it recognized him as its true master after disarming Draco, who had previously disarmed Dumbledore. Instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry chooses to destroy it.\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    Nineteen years later, Harry and Ginny Weasley, now married, watch as their youngest son leaves on the train at King’s Cross to Hogwarts alongside Ron, Hermione and their two children.\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes from the ADT.

The original screenplay written by Ernest Lehman was intended to be the basis for \"the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures\".[3][4]\n\nNorth by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity: an innocent man is pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization that aims to prevent him from blocking their plan to smuggle microfilm containing government secrets out of the country. It is one of several Hitchcock films featuring a musical score by Bernard Herrmann and an opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. The film was the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits.[5]\n\nNorth by Northwest is listed among the canonical Hitchcock films of the 1950s and is often ranked among the greatest films.[6][7] In 1995, the Library of Congress selected North by Northwest for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[8] After its first screening, reviewers for The New Yorker and The New York Times hailed it as comedic, sophisticated self-parody.[9][10]\n\n## Plot\n\nA waiter pages George Kaplan at the Oak Room restaurant at the Plaza Hotel in New York City at the request of two well-dressed men. As advertising executive Roger Thornhill summons the same waiter, he is mistaken for Kaplan, kidnapped by the pair, and brought to the estate of Lester Townsend in Glen Cove. Townsend interrogates Thornhill and subsequently arranges to kill him in a staged drunk driving crash; Thornhill survives, but fails to convince the police or his mother of what happened. Returning to the estate, Thornhill learns that Townsend is a United Nations diplomat.\n\nThornhill and his mother sneak into Kaplan's empty room at the Plaza, where the thugs have followed him. Thornhill heads to the U.N. General Assembly Building to meet Townsend, who turns out to be a completely different man, the real Lester Townsend. As he asks him about the man impersonating him, one of the gang's thugs throws a knife into Townsend's back. Townsend collapses in Thornhill's arms, and Thornhill is photographed grabbing at the knife, giving the appearance that he is the murderer. Thornhill flees, attempting to find the real Kaplan.\n\nThe \"United States Intelligence Agency\" realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, a non-existent agent they created as a decoy to distract their quarries, but its chief, \"the Professor\", decides against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation.\n\nThornhill sneaks aboard the luxurious 20th Century Limited train to Chicago without a ticket, where he meets attractive young Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police in her stateroom's upper berth. The two establish a relationship—on Kendall's part because she is secretly working with the espionageurs—and she helps him elude a police dragnet. She then tells Thornhill that she has arranged a meeting with Kaplan at a rural bus stop in Indiana. When Thornhill arrives there, he is attacked by a crop duster armed with a machine gun. After being flushed from cover in a cornfield, he attempts to halt a passing tanker truck; the airplane crashes into it and both explode. In the ensuing confusion he steals a bystander's pickup truck. At Kaplan's hotel in Chicago Thornhill learns that Kaplan had checked out before the time when Kendall claimed to have spoken with him. He goes to her room and confronts her, but she eludes him.\n\nRoger Thornhill, Eve Kendall, and Phillip Vandamm at the Mount Rushmore visitor center\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThornhill tracks Kendall to an art auction, where the Townsend-impersonator—Vandamm, the ringleader—is purchasing a small primitive statue. Vandamm instructs his henchmen to deal with Thornhill. To escape, Thornhill disrupts the auction until police are called to remove him. He confesses to them he is the fugitive murderer, but the Professor intervenes.  At the airport bound for South Dakota he tells Thornhill that Kaplan was fictitious and that Eve Kendall is their real agent. Vandamm lives above Mount Rushmore, and the agency thinks he will be leaving the country by plane from there. Thornhill agrees to help maintain Kendall's cover.\n\nAt the Mount Rushmore visitor center, now playing the role of Kaplan at the USAI's request, he negotiates for Vandamm's turnover of Kendall to be arrested. Kendall shoots Thornhill dead and flees—an act to fool Vandamm. Afterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet; Thornhill learns that Kendall is to depart on the plane with Vandamm and his right-hand man Leonard. He tries to dissuade her from going, but is knocked unconscious by the Professor's driver and locked in a hospital room.\n\nThornhill escapes and goes to Vandamm's home to rescue Kendall, where he overhears that the sculpture holds microfilm and that Leonard has discovered the blanks in Kendall's gun. Vandamm indicates that he will dispose of Kendall by throwing her from the plane; Thornhill manages to warn her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard, and Kendall head for the plane. Thornhill is momentarily held at gunpoint by the housekeeper until he realizes she's holding Kendall's gun. As Vandamm boards, Kendall takes the sculpture, runs to the pursuing Thornhill, and they flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down, they are pursued by Vandamm's men. A park ranger fatally shoots Leonard, and Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor.\n\nAs Kendall hangs on by her fingertips, Thornhill reaches down to pull her up.\n\nShe is next seen—as Mrs. Thornhill—being pulled into an upper berth on a train, which immediately enters a tunnel.\n\n## Cast\n\nCast information from Turner Classic Movies Database[11]\n\n- Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill\n- Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall\n- James Mason as Phillip Vandamm\n- Jessie Royce Landis as Clara Thornhill\n- Leo G.

In North by Northwest, he is seen getting a bus door slammed in his face, just as his credit is appearing on the screen.[15] There has been some speculation as to whether he made one of his rare second appearances, this time at around the 45-minute mark in drag as a woman in a turquoise dress on the train,[16] but in fact, the woman was played by Jesslyn Fax, who went on to appear in many episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. She had previously appeared in Rear Window.\n\n## Production\n\n### Writing\n\nCary Grant in an original still for the film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHitchcock often told journalists of an idea that he had about Cary Grant hiding from the villains inside Abraham Lincoln's nose and being given away when he sneezes. He speculated that the film could be called The Man on Lincoln's Nose.[17] Hitchcock sat on the idea, waiting for the right screenwriter to develop it. The original traveling salesman character had been suited to James Stewart, but Lehman changed it to a Madison Avenue advertising executive, a position that he had formerly held.[18]\n\nJohn Russell Taylor's 1978 biography Hitch: The Life and Times of Alfred Hitchcock suggests that the story originated after a spell of writer's block during the scripting of another film project:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock had agreed to do a film for MGM and they had chosen an adaptation of the novel The Wreck of the Mary Deare by Hammond Innes. Composer Bernard Herrmann had recommended that Hitchcock work with his friend Ernest Lehman. After a couple of weeks, Lehman offered to quit saying he didn't know what to do with the story. Hitchcock told him they got along great together and they would just write something else. Lehman said that he wanted to make the ultimate Hitchcock film. Hitchcock thought for a moment then said he had always wanted to do a chase across Mount Rushmore. Lehman and Hitchcock spitballed more ideas: a murder at the United Nations headquarters; a murder at a car plant in Detroit; a final showdown in Alaska. Eventually they settled on the U.N. murder for the opening and the chase across Mount Rushmore for the climax. For the central idea, Hitchcock remembered something an American journalist had told him about spies creating a fake agent as a decoy. Perhaps their hero could be mistaken for this fictitious agent and end up on the run. They bought the idea from the journalist for $10,000.\n\nLehman repeated this story in the documentary Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest that accompanied the 2001 DVD release of the film. Screenwriter William Goldman insisted in Which Lie Did I Tell? that it was Lehman who created North by Northwest and that many of Hitchcock's ideas were not used. Hitchcock had the idea of the hero being stranded in the middle of nowhere but suggested that the villains try to kill him with a tornado. \"But they're trying to kill him. How are they going to work up a cyclone?\" Lehman responded. \"I just can't tell you who said what to whom, but somewhere during that afternoon, the cyclone in the sky became the crop-duster plane.\"[19]\n\nHitchcock had been working on the story for nearly nine years prior to meeting Lehman.[citation needed] Otis Guernsey was the American journalist who had the idea which influenced Hitchcock, inspired by a true story during World War II when British Intelligence obtained a dead body, invented a fictitious officer who was carrying secret papers, and arranged for the body and misleading papers to be discovered by the Germans as a disinformation scheme called Operation Mincemeat. Guernsey turned his idea into a story about an American salesman who travels to the Middle East and is mistaken for a fictitious agent, becoming \"saddled with a romantic and dangerous identity\".\n\nGuernsey admitted that his treatment was full of \"corn\" and \"lacking logic\", and he urged Hitchcock to do what he liked with the story. Hitchcock bought the 60 pages for $10,000.[citation needed] In an interview in the book Screenwriters on Screenwriting (1995), Lehman stated that he had already written much of the screenplay before coming up with critical elements of the climax. An example of the \"corn\" in the finished screenplay was the scene where Roger Thornhill returns to the Townsend estate with the detectives to find everything changed. If Thornhill was indeed a spy, he would have had no reason to return to the estate after his escape the previous night, nor would the criminals be expecting him to return as they obviously did.\n\nThis was the only Hitchcock film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Since 1986, it has been owned by Turner Entertainment, as part of the pre-May 1986 MGM film library that it acquired through temporary ownership of MGM.\n\nProduction costs on North by Northwest rose when a delay in filming put Cary Grant into the penalty phase of his contract, resulting in his being paid an additional $5,000 per day before shooting even began.[20]\n\n### Casting\n\nEva Marie Saint's agent had told her that she had received an invitation to a dinner with Alfred Hitchcock and his family, the first time she and Hitchcock met. Days after the dinner, Saint's mother called her and reminded her that Hitchcock loved casting women wearing beige clothing and white gloves. Following her mother's advice, she met with Hitchcock again, wearing that combination. She credited this for helping her win the role.[21] MGM wanted Cyd Charisse for the role of Eve Kendall. Hitchcock stood by his choice of Saint.[20]\n\nHitchcock attended the Middle of the Night play in order to watch a performance by Edward G. Robinson. After being impressed by the performance of Martin Landau, Hitchcock asked to meet him at MGM. Landau arrived and Hitchcock showed him the entirety of the project, including the storyboards. While they were looking at the project, Hitchcock turned and told Landau, \"You're now Leonard.\"[21]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe United Nations headquarters is the location of a scene in the film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Hitchcock's insistence, the film was made in Paramount's VistaVision widescreen process. The only other VistaVision film made at MGM was High Society.[22]\n\nThe aircraft flying in the aerial chase scene is a Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canary, better known as the \"Yellow Peril\", a World War II Navy primary trainer sometimes converted for crop-dusting.[23] The aircraft that hits the truck and explodes is a wartime Boeing-Stearman Model 75 trainer, and many of these were used for agricultural purposes until the 1970s. The plane was piloted by Bob Coe, a crop-duster from Wasco, California.[24] Hitchcock placed replicas of square Indiana highway signs in the scene. In 2000, The Guardian ranked the crop-duster scene at No. 29 on their list of \"The top 100 film moments\".[25] The British film magazine Empire ranked it as the \"greatest movie moment\" of all time in its August 2009 issue.[26]\n\nAmong the locations used in the film are:\n\n- 430 Park Avenue .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct,.mw-parser-output .geo-inline-hidden{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap} 40°45′38″N 73°58′18″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.760694°N 73.971680°W ﻿ / 40.760694; -73.971680\n    - This is the building used by Saul Bass during the opening credits. The building was constructed in 1916 as a luxury apartment tower called the Avenue Apartments and was designed by the firm Warren and Wetmore. In 1953, the building was stripped of its façade, given a new curtain wall designed by Emery Roth and Sons in the style of Lever House, and converted to offices. Bass's title sequence is based on the geometric structure of the international style.[27]\n- Commercial Investment Trust Building (650 Madison Avenue, New York) 40°45′50″N 73°58′17″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.763965°N 73.971302°W ﻿ / 40.763965; -73.971302\n    - This is the location of Roger Thornhill's office, and the building he walks out of in his first appearance in the film. The CIT Building was designed by the firm Harrison and Abramovitz and constructed in 1957.[28]\n- Plaza Hotel (768 Fifth Avenue, New York) 40°45′53″N 73°58′27″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.764733°N 73.974241°W ﻿ / 40.764733; -73.974241\n    - After taking a cab with his secretary, Thornhill has a drink in the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel. It is here that he is kidnapped by Vandamm's henchmen. Thornhill later returns to the Plaza, where he breaks into George Kaplan's room.[29] For space reasons, most of the shots in and around the Oak Room were actually done on a set.[30]\n- Old Westbury Gardens (71 Old Westbury Road, Old Westbury) 40°46′26″N 73°35′42″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.773822°N 73.594921°W ﻿ / 40.773822; -73.594921\n    - Thornhill's kidnappers drive him to Townsend's estate on Long Island. After questioning Thornhill, Vandamm instructs Leonard and his other henchmen to intoxicate Thornhill by force.\n- United Nations headquarters 40°44′57″N 73°58′06″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.749127°N 73.968327°W ﻿ / 40.749127; -73.968327\n    - Following Thornhill's escape from Vandamm's henchmen at the Plaza, he takes a taxi to the United Nations headquarters to meet Lester Townsend. The U.N. headquarters buildings were also designed by Harrison and Abramovitz, the architects of Thornhill's office.[31] The scene of Cary Grant going to the United Nations in New York was filmed illicitly because, after reviewing the script, U.N. authorities denied permission to film on or near its property. After two failed attempts to get the required shots, Hitchcock had Grant pull up in a taxicab right outside the General Assembly Building while a hidden camera crew filmed him exiting the vehicle and walking across the plaza.[32]\n- Grand Central Terminal (89 East 42nd Street, New York) 40°45′10″N 73°58′38″W ﻿ / ﻿ 40.752724°N 73.977221°W ﻿ / 40.752724; -73.977221\n    - Following the murder of Townsend at the United Nations, Thornhill rushes to Grand Central Terminal, where he sneaks onto the 20th Century Limited en route to Chicago.\n- LaSalle Street Station (414 South LaSalle Street, Chicago) 41°52′31″N 87°37′56″W ﻿ / ﻿ 41.875304°N 87.632152°W ﻿ / 41.875304; -87.632152\n    - Thornhill and Eve Kendall arrive in Chicago at the LaSalle Street Station. At the station, Kendall gives Thornhill the instructions for his meeting with Kaplan.\n- Prairie Stop 35°45′39″N 119°33′42″W ﻿ / ﻿ 35.760814°N 119.561721°W ﻿ / 35.760814; -119.561721\n    - The famous \"crop duster scene\", which in the film takes place in rural Indiana, was actually filmed on a highway in central California near the town Wasco. Hitchcock added square signs to the location to replicate those found in Indiana.[33]\n- Ambassador East Hotel 41°54′21″N 87°37′42″W ﻿ / ﻿ 41.905856°N 87.628303°W ﻿ / 41.905856; -87.628303\n    - Thornhill returns to Chicago in a stolen truck he parks outside the Ambassador East Hotel. The hotel opened in 1926 and was designed by Robert S. DeGolyer and Co. Today, it continues to be operated as a hotel, under the name The Ambassador.[34]\n- Chicago Midway Airport 41°47′18″N 87°44′39″W ﻿ / ﻿ 41.788372°N 87.744211°W ﻿ / 41.788372; -87.744211\n    - Following Thornhill's arrest at the auction, he and the Professor travel to Midway Airport, where they board a flight for Rapid City, South Dakota. The terminal seen in the film was built in 1945-46 and was designed by architect Paul Gerhardt Sr. This terminal building was demolished in 2002.[35]\n- Memorial View Building, Mount Rushmore 43°52′37″N 103°27′22″W ﻿ / ﻿ 43.877014°N 103.456213°W ﻿ / 43.877014; -103.456213\n    - The spurious murder of Roger Thornhill takes place in the Buffalo Room of the Memorial View Building at Mount Rushmore—the one location in the park where Hitchcock was permitted to film.[36] This building was constructed in 1957 as part of the National Park Service's Mission 66 program, and was designed jointly by NPS architect Cecil J. Doty and local architect Harold Spitznagel. The building was demolished in 1994.[37]\n- Vandamm House\n    - Vandamm's house, set on a cliff atop Mount Rushmore, was not a real structure. Hitchcock asked the set designers to make the house in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright, the most popular architect in United States at the time, using the materials, form, and interiors associated with him.[38] Set designer Robert F. Boyle planned the house, which featured a cantilevered living room and made extensive use of limestone. Exterior shots were done using matte paintings,[39] while interior shots were filmed using a set built in Culver City, California, where MGM's studios were located.[40]\n\n### Costuming\n\nA panel of fashion experts convened by GQ in 2006 said the gray suit worn by Cary Grant throughout almost the entire film was the best suit in film history, and the most influential on men's style, stating that it has since been copied for Tom Cruise's character in Collateral and Ben Affleck's character in Paycheck.[41] This sentiment has been echoed by writer Todd McEwen, who called it \"gorgeous\" and wrote a short story, \"Cary Grant's Suit\", that recounts the film's plot, featuring the suit.[42][43]\n\nThere is some disagreement as to who tailored the suit; Vanity Fair magazine claimed it was Norton &amp; Sons of London,[44] although according to The Independent, it was Quintino of Beverly Hills.[45] Another article states that Grant used his Savile Row tailor, Kilgour French and Stanbury for the suit. A label reading \"Quintino\" is visible on one of the suits in the film, but this is because Quintino made duplicate suits for scenes involving more activity or stunts.[46][47]\n\nEva Marie Saint's wardrobe for the film was originally entirely chosen by MGM. Hitchcock disliked MGM's selections, and the actress and director went to Bergdorf Goodman in New York to select what she would wear.[48]\n\n### Editing and post-production\n\nIn François Truffaut's book-length interview, Hitchcock/Truffaut (1967), Hitchcock said that MGM wanted North by Northwest cut by 15 minutes so the film's length would run under two hours. Hitchcock had his agent check his contract, learned that he had absolute control over the final cut, and refused.[49]\n\nOne of Eva Marie Saint's lines in the dining-car seduction scene was redubbed. She originally said, \"I never make love on an empty stomach\", but it was changed in post-production to \"I never discuss love on an empty stomach\", as the censors considered the original version too risqué.[50]\n\n## Release\n\nTrailer for North by Northwest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film opened on July 1, 1959, at the United Artists Theatre in Chicago.[1] It had a seven-week run at Radio City Music Hall in August and September 1959. One trailer for North by Northwest features Hitchcock presenting himself as the owner of Alfred Hitchcock Travel Agency and telling the viewer he has made a motion picture to advertise these wonderful vacation stops.[51] A new 70mm restoration of the film, remastered in 13K resolution from the original VistaVision elements, premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Festival on June 12, 2024, to celebrate the film's 65th anniversary.[52][53]\n\n### Home media\n\nNorth by Northwest was released on the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States in November 2009, by Warner Bros. with a 1080p VC-1 encoding.[54][55] This release is a special 50th-anniversary edition, restored and remastered from original VistaVision elements. A DVD edition was also released. A 65th anniversary 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray was released in 2024 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[56]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nIn its opening in Chicago, it grossed $46,000 in its first week and $35,000 the second week.[57] The film grossed $209,000 in its opening week at Radio City Music Hall, setting a record opening week at the theater, as well as its record non-holiday week gross, and went on to gross a record $404,056 in two weeks.[58][59] Its opening at the Music Hall saw it become the number one film at the US box office, where it remained for its seven weeks at the Music Hall.[60] By the end of August, it had grossed $2,568,000 from 139 engagements ($27.7 million in 2024 dollars[61]).[62]\n\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned theatrical rentals of $5,740,000 in the United States and Canada and $4.1 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $837,000.[2]\n\n### Critical reception\n\nA contemporary in Time called the film \"smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining\".[63] A. H. Weiler of The New York Times made it a \"Critic's Pick\" and said it was the \"year's most scenic, intriguing and merriest chase\"; he also complimented the two leads:\n\nCary Grant, a veteran member of the Hitchcock acting varsity, was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam. He handles the grimaces, the surprised look, the quick smile, ... and all the derring-do with professional aplomb and grace, In casting Eva Marie Saint as his romantic vis-à-vis, Mr. Hitchcock has plumbed some talents not shown by the actress heretofore. Although she is seemingly a hard, designing type, she also emerges both the sweet heroine and a glamorous charmer.[64]\n\nPeriod film critic Charles Champlin saw the film as an \"anthology of typical Hitchcockian situations\" and was particularly taken by the scene and suspense in which Grant's character avoids death when attacked by a crop-dusting plane in the cornfields, which he believed was representative of Hitchcock's finest work.[65] Sight &amp; Sound critic Penelope Houston called it \"the purest piece of entertainment filmmaking\".[66]\n\nThe Village Voice ranked North by Northwest at No. 49 in its \"Top 250 Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.[67]\n\nEntertainment Weekly voted it the 44th-greatest film of all time in 1999.[68]\n\nIn 2002 author and journalist Nick Clooney praised Lehman's original story and sophisticated dialogue, calling the film \"certainly Alfred Hitchcock's most stylish thriller, if not his best\".[69]\n\nThe London edition of Time Out, reviewing the film in 2008, commented:\n\nFifty years on, you could say that Hitchcock's sleek, wry, paranoid thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, the film's sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity, certainly wouldn't be out of place in Mad Men. But there's nothing dated about this perfect storm of talent, from Hitchcock and Grant to writer Ernest Lehman (Sweet Smell of Success), co-stars James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, composer Bernard Herrmann and even designer Saul Bass, whose opening-credits sequence still manages to send a shiver down the spine.[70]\n\nThe film was voted at No. 28 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine Cahiers du cinéma in 2008.[71]\n\nIn 2010, The Guardian ranked it as the second-best action and war film of all time.[72]\n\nThe film ranks at No. 98 in Empire's 2011 list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time.[73]\n\nIn the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight &amp; Sound polls of the greatest films ever made, North by Northwest was ranked 53rd among critics;[74]\n\nAs of 2014 North by Northwest holds a 97% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site states the critical consensus as: \"Gripping, suspenseful and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow.\"[75] On Metacritic, it has a score of 98 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics.[76] In 1998, Time Out conducted a poll, and North by Northwest was voted the twelfth greatest film of all time.[77]\n\nNorth by Northwest was ranked 13th in BBC's 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.[78] In 2022, Time Out named North by Northwest the greatest thriller film ever made.[79]\n\nThe Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay No. 21 on its 2020 list of 101 Greatest Screenplays ever written.[80] It is ranked the 40th-greatest American film by the American Film Institute.[81]\n\nThe Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2022 poll ranked the film 45th among critics.[82]\n\n### Awards\n\nNorth by Northwest was nominated for three Academy Awards—Best Film Editing (George Tomasini), Best Art Direction – Set Decoration, Color (William A. Horning, Robert F. Boyle, Merrill Pye, Henry Grace, and Frank R. McKelvy), and Best Original Screenplay (Ernest Lehman)—at the 32nd Academy Awards ceremony.[83] Two of the three awards went instead to Ben-Hur, and the other went to Pillow Talk. The film—and Lehman specifically—also won a 1960 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Hitchcock received his second Silver Shell for Best Director award at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. (He was also awarded the Silver Shell the year before for Vertigo.)[84][85]\n\nIn 1995, North by Northwest was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"10 Top 10\"—the best 10 films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. North by Northwest was acknowledged as the seventh-best film in the mystery genre.[86] It was also listed as No. 40 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies,[87] No. 4 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills,[88] and No. 55 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).[89]\n\n## Themes and motifs\n\nJames Mason, Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant at Mount Rushmore during filming. Studio mockups were intercut with actual monument footage for the climactic scene.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSign near Mount Rushmore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHitchcock planned the film as a change of pace after his dark romantic thriller Vertigo a year earlier. In his book-length interview Hitchcock/Truffaut (1967) with François Truffaut, Hitchcock said that he wanted to do \"something fun, light-hearted, and generally free of the symbolism permeating his other movies.\"[90] Writer Ernest Lehman has also mocked those who look for symbolism in the film.[91] Despite its popular appeal, the film is considered to be a masterpiece for its themes of deception, mistaken identity, and moral relativism in the Cold War era.\n\nSome[according to whom?] have mistaken the title North by Northwest as having come from a line in Hamlet[citation needed] (\"I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw\"), a work also concerned with the shifty nature of reality.[92] However, Hitchcock explained in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich in 1963: \"It's a fantasy. The whole film is epitomized in the title—there is no such thing as north-by-northwest on the compass.\"[93] (The similar \"northwest by north\" is indeed one of 32 points of the compass.)\n\nLehman states that he used a working title for the film of In a Northwesterly Direction because the film's action was to begin in New York and climax in Alaska. Then the head of the story department at MGM suggested North by Northwest, but this was still to be a working title. Other titles were considered, including The Man on Lincoln's Nose, but North by Northwest was kept because, according to Lehman, \"We never did find a [better] title.\"[17] The Northwest Airlines was worked into the film, reinforcing the title.\n\nThe film's plot involves a \"MacGuffin\"—a term popularized by Hitchcock—which is a physical object that everyone in the film is chasing, but which has no deep relationship to the plot. Late in North by Northwest, it emerges that the spies are attempting to smuggle microfilm containing government secrets out of the country.  The film's protagonist, Roger Thornhill, only becomes involved through a case of mistaken identity (with a spy that does not even exist, \"George Kaplan\"), and only becomes a target for elimination when he becomes a persistent nuisance as a result.\n\nNorth by Northwest has been referred to as \"the first James Bond film\"[94] because of its splashily colorful settings, secret agents, and an elegant, daring, wisecracking leading man opposite a sinister yet strangely charming villain. The crop-duster scene inspired the helicopter chase in From Russia with Love.[95]\n\nThe film's final shot—that of the train speeding into a tunnel during a romantic embrace onboard—is a famous bit of self-conscious Freudian symbolism reflecting Hitchcock's mischievous sense of humor. In the book Hitchcock/Truffaut (pp. 107–108), Hitchcock called it a \"phallic symbol ... probably one of the most impudent shots I ever made\".\n\n## Influences\n\nThe film was very influential on the James Bond films and subsequent action-thriller films, as well as the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., where Leo G. Carroll played the same sort of role as the head of a top secret intelligence agency.[96][97][98]\n\nThe film's title is reported to have been the influence for the name of the popular annual live-music festival South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, started in 1987, with the name idea coming from Louis Black, editor and co-founder of the local alternative weekly The Austin Chronicle, as a play on the Hitchcock film title.[99]\n\nThe third episode of the 14th season of Doctor Who serial \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976) includes an homage to North by Northwest, when the Doctor, who like Hitchcock's hero is falsely accused of a politically motivated murder, is attacked by gunfire from a biplane piloted by one of his enemy's henchmen.[100]\n\nThe 2010 Spanish dark comedy film The Last Circus pays visual homage to the Mount Rushmore scene in its climactic scene atop a controversial Francoist monument.[101][102]\n\n## Adaptations\n\nNorth by Northwest was adapted as a stage play by Carolyn Burns. The adaptation premiered at the Melbourne Theatre Company in 2015.[103]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films considered the best\n- The Man on Lincoln's Nose, a 2000 documentary film\n- \"North by North Quahog\", an episode of American animated sitcom Family Guy parodying the Hitchcock film\n- Silver Streak, a 1976 action-comedy film with a similar tone and plot elements\n- J.

It features Bill Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis as the lead trio of unconventional parapsychologists who establish a ghost-busting enterprise in New York City. The film also includes notable performances by Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, and William Atherton.\n\nInitially inspired by Aykroyd’s interest in the supernatural and intended to star himself and John Belushi traversing time and space to fight ghosts, the project was reshaped after Belushi’s untimely death in 1982, and Ramis scaled down Aykroyd’s initial vision to be more financially viable and grounded in New York City.\n\nMarking a pioneering moment, Ghostbusters was among the first comedies to integrate costly special effects. Despite concerns from Columbia Pictures over its $25–30 million budget, the film underwent principal photography from October 1983 to January 1984 across New York City and Los Angeles. In facing a crowded special effects market, Richard Edlund utilized the budget to establish Boss Film Studios, which crafted the movie’s spectral imagery through a mix of practical effects, miniatures, and puppetry.\n\nUpon its release on June 8, 1984, Ghostbusters received widespread critical praise. It became an instant cultural icon, particularly lauded for its inventive mix of humor, action, and spooky elements, with Murray’s role frequently highlighted. It amassed $282.2 million in its initial run, becoming 1984’s second-highest earner in the U.S. and Canada and setting records as the era’s most lucrative comedy. Continuous theatrical showings have pushed its earnings to approximately $295.2 million.\n\nThe Library of Congress honored the film by preserving it in the National Film Registry in 2015, and the catchy theme song by Ray Parker Jr. topped the charts.\n\nSpawning a vast franchise worth billions, Ghostbusters inspired an animated TV series (The Real Ghostbusters and later Extreme Ghostbusters), video games, comics, merchandise, and more. Despite a less successful sequel in 1989 and a paused attempt at a third film after Ramis died in 2014, the franchise saw a revival with a reboot in 2016 and a direct sequel to the original, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, in 2021. Another sequel, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, will be released on March 22, 2024.\n\n# See how the original Ghostbusters hits the Save the Cat! story beats!\n\nWritten by: Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis\n\nDirected by: Ivan Reitman\n\nGenre: Superhero (People’s Superhero) Cousins: Gladiator, High Plains Drifter, Greystoke, Ghostbusters II, Ben-Hur, The Three Musketeers, Robin Hood, Whale Rider, Casino Royale\n\nOpening Image: In the vibrant heart of New York City, where life pulsates at a relentless pace, a backdrop is laid for a tale tinged with the supernatural. A foreboding piece of gothic artistry stands over the city’s rhythm: a menacing lion statue perched before the library’s entrance. This fearsome guardian hints at hidden depths and darker layers enshrouding the metropolis, promising the significant role that the city’s storied edifices and the ominous gothic motifs will play as the story unfolds.\n\nThe stone lion of the NYC public library preludes stone monsters later.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet-Up: A librarian (Alice Drummond) encounters a terrifying phenomenon, setting the stage for an unusual investigation. Simultaneously, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), parapsychologists at Columbia University, find themselves deeply engrossed in studying the paranormal.\n\nIn their graffiti-adorned university office, Dr. Venkman engages more in the seduction of a blonde volunteer (Jennifer Runyon) through an ESP experiment and less in actual science as he administers electric shocks to another participant (Steven Tash). This scene is abruptly interrupted by Ray, who bursts in with news of the extraordinary events unfolding at the library.\n\nDr. Venkman initially exploits his power of persuasion for selfish purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTheme Stated: The male participant tells off Venkman after receiving the shocks, which is Venkman’s effort to discourage him and draw favor with the attractive female student. The student says he’s pissed off and leaves, not taking the five bucks he was offered. Venkman has the longest way to go in the story, as he doesn’t believe in the supernatural and only uses his stature as a hustle. He must go from zero to hero during the later haunted events.\n\nRushing to the library, Venkman and Stantz reunite with their intellectually inclined colleague, Egon, where they collect ectoplasm, observe supernatural phenomena such as vertically stacked books, and encounter a ghost. Despite their expertise, they find themselves unprepared to handle the situation and are quickly scared away by the ghost.\n\nHowever, the venture is not in vain, as Egon succeeds in gathering essential data that hints at a possible method for trapping ghosts, marking the beginning of their new venture into ghostbusting.\n\nThe ill-prepared doctors meet their first ghost—and fail.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatalyst: When they return to the university, Dean Yeager throws them out because their grant is no longer being funded. The dean’s decision to expel them, deeming them subpar scientists, does little to dampen their spirits.\n\nVenkman suggests to Stantz that they go into business for themselves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDebate: Venkman is unfazed. Buoyed by their novel ghost-trapping technique, he is eager to take their talents into the private sector and kick-start their venture in ghost eradication. And so, the paranormal trio seizes the opportunity amidst a rise in ghostly occurrences to transform their specialized knowledge into a profitable enterprise.\n\nEmbracing the concept of capturing ghosts, they establish “Ghostbusters,” a service dedicated to the extermination of the supernatural. Though they don’t have special powers in the traditional superhero sense, they are on a mission to do good.\n\nThe Ghostbusters set up their headquarters in a firehouse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDoubts linger among the Ghostbusters about the viability of their new business, compounded by the financial strain they encounter, such as the need to mortgage Ray’s childhood home to inject capital into their venture. Despite these challenges, they acquire an old firehouse on the brink of condemnation, establish their headquarters, produce a commercial, and bring on a secretary to complete their Set-Up.\n\nB Story: In a parallel development, Dana Barrett ( Sigourney Weaver) encounters an evil entity in her fridge. Seeking assistance, she becomes their first prospective client. Though Venkman is on the make for the attractive Dana, she will help him grow into a caring, responsible person, which is what it takes to be a hero.\n\nDana Barrett is about to experience paranormal activity off the scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBreak into Two: Venkman seizes the opportunity to inspect Dana’s upscale art deco apartment, though his attention seems more on Dana than the supernatural. His less-than-professional approach exasperates her, leading her to dismiss him. However, Venkman is determined to win her trust by resolving the sinister mystery of the creature in her refrigerator.\n\nThey’re ready to believe you.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFun and Games: Secretary Janine Melnitz (Annie Potts) declares, “We got one!” The arrival of their first genuine case marks a pivotal moment for the team, as they are now financially destitute.\n\nSlimer is the slimy ghost haunting the Sedgewick Hotel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the posh Sedgewick Hotel, the paranormal doctors engage in a lively pursuit of a mischievous ghost, dubbed Slimer, culminating in its capture with their innovative proton-pack and trap system. Spengler warns, “Do not cross the streams” of their energy packs (advice that will pay off later in the Finale).\n\nThis victory nets them a handsome fee of $5,000. By successfully capturing their first ghost at a hotel, the Ghostbusters signal their inaugural foray into professional ghostbusting.\n\nThe Ghostbusters ready themselves for their first big case.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEchoing the iconic montages familiar in Superhero tales like those of Superman or ‘80s movies generally, the Ghostbusters’ rise to fame is chronicled through magazine covers and their increasingly popular ghostbusting exploits, capturing the city’s imagination. As the Ghostbusters’ popularity surges, Dana becomes increasingly intrigued by Venkman, her interest piqued by his part in the spectral shenanigans.\n\nThe ghost trap is the busters’ claim to fame.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the chaos, Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) applies for the job of Ghostbuster and is immediately hired. The cost of success has the paranormal police withered and dispirited, and they can use all the help they can get. Stantz shows Zeddmore the ropes and how they trap ghosts.\n\nA representative from the EPA, Walter Peck (William Atherton), shows up to investigate their operation and determine whether they’re storing any hazardous chemicals onsite. When Venkman rubs the inspector the wrong way—he does that—the official says he’ll be back with a court order. Peck is the nemesis of the newly minted heroes. This also sets up the curse, as a few want to punish the heroes for doing good, which they must surmount.\n\nMidpoint: During an electrical storm, Gozer makes a move and unleashes two hell beasts from their stony entombment. One, Zuul, the Gatekeeper, possesses Dana. The other possesses Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), Dana’s nerdy neighbor, as Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster. When Venkman stops by for their date, he discovers a possessed Dana, tying A and B Stories together. To manage the situation, Venkman administers Thorazine to Dana. Now, the stakes have risen, and the clock is ticking.\n\nPossessed Dana welcomes Venkman into her apartment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBad Guys Close In: The police bring Tully to the Ghostbusters’ firehouse in a paddy wagon. The possessed tells Egon and Janine that he must meet the gatekeeper. Venkman phones and says Dana is possessed. The scientists decide it’s best to keep them separated.\n\nGozer also possesses Louis Tully.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter finishing up a long day of ghostbusting, Zeddmore and Stantz start talking about the Book of Revelations, and they surmise that the dead are returning to life because it’s written in the Bible.\n\nWalter Peck shows up with a court order to shut down the storage tank the Ghostbusters use to stow their spirits. The entire thing explodes, releasing all the ghosts into the surrounding city. In addition, the Ghostbusters are arrested. Tully escapes, heading back toward his apartment for a date with destiny with the gatekeeper.\n\nAll Is Lost: The Ghostbusters are jailed while spectral chaos engulfs New York City, which adds a whiff of death. While incarcerated, Ray and Egon uncover that Dana’s apartment complex was architecturally masterminded by Ivo Shandor, the head of a cult devoted to Gozer in the early 1900s. Shandor engineered the building to serve as a beacon, channeling and amplifying ghostly energy to invoke Gozer and initiate the world’s end.\n\nDark Night of the Soul: The Gatekeeper and the Keymaster entities cross paths, further escalating the supernatural crisis. They rise together to the top of the building to consecrate their evil union.\n\nIn response to the escalating ghostly siege, the city’s mayor demands an audience with the Ghostbusters. Venkman seizes the opportunity to persuade the mayor to release them and grant them a chance to quell the supernatural uprising, thereby proving their worth and gaining his confidence. This is a synergistic moment for Venkman as he uses his schmoozing and wants to do good to convince the mayor and vanquish Walter Peck from the office.\n\nBreak into Three: The Ghostbusters receive the assistance of the National Guard and a police escort to Dana’s building on Central Park West. They are cheered on by fans.\n\nFive-Point Finale:\n\n1) Gathering the Team: With the fabulous four gathered and the city’s support, they move to bust some ghosts and save the world.\n\nThe Gatekeeper and Keymaster have consecrated their union to welcome Gozer to our plane of reality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2) Executing the Plan: After walking up countless flights of stairs, the Ghostbusters reach the structure’s roof to do battle with Gozer and the entity’s two hellhounds (Dana and Louis).\n\nThe fab four face Gozer the Gozerian.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3) High Tower Surprise: Venkman suggests that Stantz talks to Gozer. The evil entity asks the human if he’s a god, to which he replies he isn’t. Using powerful lightning bolts, Gozer nearly ends the Ghostbusters by zapping them all off the roof.\n\nGozer is not impressed with the meddling humans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4) Dig, Deep Down: Armed with their proton packs, the four Ghostbusters attempt to zap Gozer out of existence. However, Gozer vanishes and, with a disembodied voice, asks them to choose their Destructor. Venkman figures it out that if they keep their minds blank, they’ll be fine—no Destructor. Unfortunately, Stantz thinks of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, a cozy icon from childhood. And a 113-foot-tall marshmallow man appears to destroy the Ghostbusters.\n\n5) Executing the New Plan: The Ghostbusters attempt to neutralize the giant marshmallow monster, but they only infuriate it. Then Spengler has the idea to cross the streams of their proton packs as it could cause a negative particle reversal. Venkman warns that Spengler could be wrong, and they could all die. What choice do they have? And so, coming together as a team, four becoming one, they cross the streams of their proto packs and destroy Gozer, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and the hounds.\n\nThe Ghostbusters try to make a 113-foot s’more.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal Image: The Ghostbusters have saved the day, as well as saving Dana and Louis. And Walter Peck is covered in hundreds of pounds of marshmallow fluff. They return to the streets as the city’s champions, greeted by enthusiastic supporters. The once doubted and disparaged team is now hailed as valiant saviors, with the public expressing their deep gratitude. In a heartwarming reversal of fortunes, Venkman earns a kiss from Dana, symbolizing their transformation from skeptics’ mockery to lauded heroes.\n\nThe Ghostbusters have survived to bust another day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3 Ways Contest Feedback Can Positively Impact Your Screenplay\n\nThe Housemaid Novel Beat Sheet Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Don Roff\n\nAward-winning author Don Roff has written nearly 20 books, primarily of a scary nature, for children and adults.

You can tell immediately when a writer or creator doesn’t really use any substances themselves, because their depiction will be weirdly, strangely off2. I love it when people stride into bars on TV shows and order “a beer” or “a Scotch,” as if there weren’t 5,000 examples of each, in various categories and at various price points. Or when people are depicted as constantly hitting a vape while working or operating heavy machinery or just living their lives, with no visible impairment3. Or when hangovers are represented with a grimace and a groan and then the character is running marathons or doing complex math problems instead of puking their guts out and praying to heretofore unsuspected godlings for salvation4.\n\nOr, most egregiously, when actors depict inebriation with broad, slurry, florid acting. This is especially true when the character is intended to be someone with a substance problem­—TV shows and films regularly depict inebriation as if it’s all falling down and zero coping, when reality is pretty much the opposite: Drunk people are hyper aware that they’re drunk, and they put effort into masking it5.\n\nWhich brings us to The Nice Guys, the most unlikely sleeper hit of 2016. It’s a clever little movie, with some snappy writing by Shane Black and some terrific performances. But it really stands out as one of the sharpest character studies of functional alcoholics ever put on screen. In short, there’s some excellent character work in this goofy movie.\n\n### Don't Say “And Stuff.” Just Say “Dad, There Are Whores Here”\n\nIn real life this kid is still in therapy to this day, and cries 4 times every hour.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a visual media like film, character is a combination of the written word, the visuals the audience gets, and the performance of the actors. Bad writing overdoes the exposition, telling you things, usually in the most awkward way possible (having other characters tell each other things about themselves is a favorite dick move, as is asking questions everyone in the story already knows the answer to just so you can make a little speech)6. In The Nice Guys, however, there’s almost zero character exposition (there’s plenty of plot exposition, however). Like, zero. Which is unusual. Everything you know about Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and Holland March (Ryan Gosling) you get from visuals, performance, and the occasional organic bit of dialogue.\n\nFor example, Healy’s drinking problem. At the end of the film, Healy is fall-down drunk, sitting at a bar drinking straight from a bottle. It’s the first time in the film that he takes a drink; he spends the whole story refusing cocktails, but not in a showy way. If you’re not paying close attention, it might seem like he’s just in work mode, but the repetition of the refusal becomes meaningful. It’s really this detail that makes the final scene, where Healy is deep inside a bottle, land. When Holland jokes “At least you’re drinking again,” it’s a dark, dark line because of the Implications7.\n\nHolland’s drinking is much more obvious. He’s pretty soaked throughout the film, and eventually we learn that his wife is dead and he blames himself for it. But it’s easy to see his boozing as casual and thematically appropriate both for the time period (Mad Men conditioned us to see the 1960s and 1970s as a sort of Booze Golden Age when everyone from your pediatrician to your first grade teacher had a bottle of Canadian Club in a drawer8) and the profession—Holland’s a private eye, after all, and as you know private dicks drink, and drink hard. So it’s not immediately obvious that Holland is in a lot of trouble9. The scene where his young daughter drives him home because he insisted on stopping off at a bar and tying one on towards the middle of the film is the first indication that Holland March has a serious drinking problem.\n\nBoth characters are functioning alcoholics. One is deep in a bender, one is deep in those regular attempts at self-regulating. And none of it is simply told to you. You have to just pick it up.\n\n### Marriage Is Buying a House for Someone You Hate\n\nI may be the only one in the audience who sees characters wearing the same clothes through several days worth of murderous adventures and fixates on how bad they must smell.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film is filled with these little details that come together to give you a very clear idea who these two men are. Holland is a functional drunk and often doesn’t seem inebriated—something alcoholics get very good at as they compensate for and learn to hide their disease10. But he’s unsteady and uncoordinated throughout, cutting his arm badly when he tries to break a window, stumbling and falling frequently, and demonstrating terrible, awful aim. At first glance he looks like a slightly tired Ryan Gosling, winning at life, but his behavior subtly shows how fucked up he is.\n\nJackson Healy very obviously doesn’t drink, but in a very short flashback to his wife informing him that she’s been having an affair with his father, he’s shown drinking wine, a subtle hint that his teetotalling is relatively recent and not a regular lifestyle for him.\n\nAnd, of course, the character of Holly March (Angourie Rice) is a tragic portrait of the child of an alcoholic. She’s independent because she has to be—her father is usually too wasted to keep tabs on her. She acts as if the parent-child relationship is reversed. She’s eleven years old and knows how to drive in Los Angeles. She’s unfazed by anything in large part because she’s had to keep a poker face in response to all of her father’s misadventures. Everything you need to know about Holland March you can learn from his poor daughter—which also makes her final appearance in the film, standing guard in a tavern during the day, a tragedy. This kid doesn’t go to school. She doesn’t have a normal life. She’s totally screwed and will be in therapy for decades11.\n\nAnd none of this is told to you, it’s shown. It’s solid writing, and is a big reason why this movie has become one of those culty movies that people keep discovering and then wondering why it wasn’t a bigger hit.\n\nFor some reason, my ears were burning throughout the writing of this essay. I have no idea why. My own relationship with substances is perfectly healthy and innocent12.\n\nNext Week: A movie you never saw demonstrates the pitfalls of motivating your character.\n\nIf you enjoy this newsletter, consider subsrcibing to my paid fiction Substack, Writing Without Rules: From the Notebook!\n\nThanks for reading Writing Without Rules: Deep Dives! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nThe rules are to just drink steadily until everything improves. I don’t want to brag, but it usually works.\n\n“Mr. Smith ordered a bottle of Jack Daniels with a side order of mescal, mixed them in a bowl and proceeded to slurp from it using his personal drinking spoon, grunting in extremely normal human pleasure as he did so.”\n\nMeanwhile, if I have one beer my whole night is basically over in terms of concentration and writing work. I used to romanticize the alcoholic genius writer cliche, imagining myself like Keuroac, sweatily drunk with a bottle next to my typewriter as I banged out a classic banger of a novel, but quickly realized that would never actually work. And then I was sad, and I’ve been lowkey sad ever since.\n\nIn many TV shows, hangovers are momentary moments of regret instead of day long gauntlets of white-knuckle survival. Wait … do I drink too much? Don’t answer that.\n\nMy own efforts to feign sobriety are undone because Drunk Jeff thinks the world has been waiting to hear him sing. I get it from my father, who spent many nights with headphones on absolutely shredding Clancy Brothers songs.\n\nThe easiest clue that you’re watching a bad movie is when characters use the phrase “as you know”:\n\nPierre le Chat: Why are we trying to save this person?\n\nMonique Gremlins: As you know, he’s my husband, and your best friend, who you swore to always save if he was in trouble.\n\nPierre le Chat: Right! As you know, I suffered a lot of traumatic brain injury a few years ago, and now I forget things.\n\nMonique Gremlins: As you know, I am a world-class brain surgeon, and I saved your life.\n\nI’m actually starting to enjoy writing this little vignette, so let’s stop before I write a novel entitled GREMLINS AND CHAT right here in the footnotes and become a millionaire author of leisure.\n\nThe other dark part of this is how fucking happy and relieved other drinkers are when someone gives up trying to stay sober and falls off the wagon. Their dark joy at someone’s failure to sober up is palpable, and The Nice Guys gets that.\n\nMy father worked at a bank in the 1970s, can confirm that everyone was pretty much tipsy pretty much all the time.\n\nIt also helps that he looks like Ryan Gosling, because we’re trained to imagine alcoholics are sweaty, gruesome folks with three-day beards and shaking hands. That comes later.\n\nSimilar to the way I work to hide my general stupidity by wearing a monocle and answering every question with a question.\n\nOne imagines when she grows tall enough to reach the liquor cabinet at home things are going to get interesting.\n\nIs “My Relationship with Substances is Perfectly Healthy and Innocent” the title of my memoir? Yes.\n\n8\n\n#### Share this post\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWriting Without Rules: Deep Dives\n\n‘The Nice Guys’ and Character Work\n\nCopy link\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail\n\nNotes\n\nMore\n\n5\n\nShare\n\n#### Discussion about this post\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn my watchlist for tonight.\n\nExpand full comment\n\nReply\n\nShare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNo, you aren't the only one thinking about how crusty and smelly those clothes must be.\n\nExpand full comment\n\nReply\n\nShare\n\nNo posts\n\nReady for more?\n\n© 2025 Jeff Somers\n\nis the home for great culture\n\n#### Share\n\nCopy link\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail\n\nNotes\n\nMore\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

This is especially true when the character is intended to be someone with a substance problem—TV shows and films regularly depict inebriation as if it’s all falling down and zero coping, when reality is pretty much the opposite: Drunk people are hyper aware that they’re drunk, and they put effort into masking it.\n                Which brings us to The Nice Guys, the most unlikely sleeper hit of 2016. It’s a clever little movie, with some snappy writing by Shane Black and some terrific performances. But it really stands out as one of the sharpest character studies of functional alcoholics ever put on screen. In short, there’s some excellent character work in this goofy movie.\n                In real life this kid is still in therapy to this day, and cries 4 times every hour.\n                In a visual media like film, character is a combination of the written word, the visuals the audience gets, and the performance of the actors. Bad writing overdoes the exposition, telling you things, usually in the most awkward way possible (having other characters tell each other things about themselves is a favorite dick move, as is asking questions everyone in the story already knows the answer to just so you can make a little speech). In The Nice Guys, however, there’s almost zero character exposition (there’s plenty of plot exposition, however). Like, zero. Which is unusual. Everything you know about Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and Holland March (Ryan Gosling) you get from visuals, performance, and the occasional organic bit of dialogue.\n                For example, Healy’s drinking problem. At the end of the film, Healy is fall-down drunk, sitting at a bar drinking straight from a bottle. It’s the first time in the film that he takes a drink; he spends the whole story refusing cocktails, but not in a showy way. If you’re not paying close attention, it might seem like he’s just in work mode, but the repetition of the refusal becomes meaningful. It’s really this detail that makes the final scene, where Healy is deep inside a bottle, land. When Holland jokes “At least you’re drinking again,” it’s a dark, dark line because of the implications.\n                Holland’s drinking is much more obvious. He’s pretty soaked throughout the film, and eventually we learn that his wife is dead and he blames himself for it. But it’s easy to see his boozing as casual and thematically appropriate both for the time period (Mad Men conditioned us to see the 1960s and 1970s as a sort of Booze Golden Age when everyone from your pediatrician to your first grade teacher had a bottle of Canadian Club in a drawer) and the profession—Holland’s a private eye, after all, and as you know private dicks drink, and drink hard. So it’s not immediately obvious that Holland is in a lot of trouble. The scene where his young daughter drives him home because he insisted on stopping off at a bar and tying one on towards the middle of the film is the first indication that Holland March has a serious drinking problem.\n                Both characters are functioning alcoholics. One is deep in a bender, one is deep in those regular attempts at self-regulating. And none of it is simply told to you. You have to just pick it up.\n                The film is filled with these little details that come together to give you a very clear idea who these two men are. Holland is a functional drunk and often doesn’t seem inebriated—something alcoholics get very good at as they compensate for and learn to hide their disease. But he’s unsteady and uncoordinated throughout, cutting his arm badly when he tries to break a window, stumbling and falling frequently, and demonstrating terrible, awful aim. At first glance he looks like a slightly tired Ryan Gosling, winning at life, but his behavior subtly shows how messed up he is.\n                Jackson Healy very obviously doesn’t drink, but in a very short flashback to his wife informing him that she’s been having an affair with his father, he’s shown drinking wine, a subtle hint that his teetotalling is relatively recent and not a regular lifestyle for him.\n                And, of course, the character of Holly March (Angourie Rice) is a tragic portrait of the child of an alcoholic. She’s independent because she has to be—her father is usually too wasted to keep tabs on her. She acts as if the parent-child relationship is reversed. She’s eleven years old and knows how to drive in Los Angeles. She’s unfazed by anything in large part because she’s had to keep a poker face in response to all of her father’s misadventures. Everything you need to know about Holland March you can learn from his poor daughter—which also makes her final appearance in the film, standing guard in a tavern during the day, a tragedy. This kid doesn’t go to school. She doesn’t have a normal life. She’s totally screwed and will be in therapy for decades.\n                And none of this is told to you, it’s shown. It’s solid writing, and is a big reason why this movie has become one of those culty movies that people keep discovering and then wondering why it wasn’t a bigger hit.\n                ]]>\n            </AdditionalInformation>\n        </movieRecommendation>\n    </content>\n</article>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant attributes according to the ADT provided.

It is a standalone sequel to Suicide Squad (2016) and the tenth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was written and directed by James Gunn and stars Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Sylvester Stallone, Viola Davis, David Dastmalchian, Daniela Melchior, Michael Rooker, Jai Courtney, Peter Capaldi, Alice Braga, and Pete Davidson. In the film, several convicts join a task force known as the \"Suicide Squad\" in exchange for lighter sentences. They are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese to destroy all traces of the giant alien starfish Starro the Conqueror before it falls into the local government's control.\n\nWarner Bros. originally hired Gavin O'Connor to direct. However, O'Connor left due to creative differences, and Gunn was hired to write and direct the film after being temporarily fired by Disney and Marvel Studios as director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). He drew inspiration from war films and John Ostrander's 1980s Suicide Squad comics. Filming took place from September 2019 to February 2020, primarily in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as in Colón, Panama, and Porto, Portugal. The film had the biggest sets ever built for a Warner Bros. production.\n\nThe Suicide Squad premiered theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 30, 2021. It was released in the United States on August 5, simultaneously in theaters and on the streaming service HBO Max. It underperformed at the box office grossing $169 million worldwide against a production budget of $185 million. The film received positive reviews from critics unlike its predecessor and became the most-streamed DCEU film on HBO Max. The film's box office performance was attributed to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the film's availability on HBO Max, and its relationship to the first Suicide Squad.\n\nPeacemaker, a spin-off television series starring Cena, debuted on HBO Max in January 2022, and Waller, another television series starring Viola Davis, is in development for Max.\n\n## Plot\n\nIntelligence officer Amanda Waller assembles two Task Force X teams, colloquially known as the \"Suicide Squad\", which consists of Belle Reve penitentiary inmates who agree to carry out missions in exchange for commuted sentences. The teams are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese after an anti-American regime overthrows its government, and are tasked with destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim, which houses the secret experiment \"Project Starfish\".\n\nUpon making landfall, the Corto Maltese military slaughters most of the first team and capture Harley Quinn while team leader Rick Flag escapes. Elsewhere, the second team - led by assassin Bloodsport, who Waller blackmailed in exchange for not sending his estranged daughter Tyla to prison, and consisting of Peacemaker, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher 2, and her pet rat Sebastian - enters the country undetected. Waller orders the squad to find Flag, who is being held at a rebel base. The team massacres the rebel soldiers, only to learn that rebellion leader Sol Soria had saved Flag. Despite the group's actions, Soria agrees to help them infiltrate the capital, where they capture Project Starfish's lead scientist, the Thinker. Harley is taken to Corto Maltese's new dictator, Silvio Luna, who wishes to marry her. After learning of Luna's plans to use Project Starfish on political dissidents, Harley kills him and escapes. She joins the others, who use the Thinker to break into Jötunheim and begin rigging it with explosives.\n\nFlag and Ratcatcher 2 enter the Thinker's laboratory and find Starro the Conqueror, a giant starfish–like alien that creates smaller versions of itself to kill people and control their bodies. The Thinker explains that Starro was brought to Earth by the U.S. government, which has secretly funded the experiments for decades using Corto Maltesean citizens as test subjects. An enraged Flag decides to leak a hard drive containing evidence of this, but is killed by Peacemaker, who is under orders from Waller to cover up the U.S.'s involvement. Meanwhile, a skirmish between the rest of the team and the military leads to Polka-Dot Man accidentally setting off the explosives prematurely. As Jötunheim crumbles, the drive falls into Ratcatcher 2's possession. Peacemaker attempts to kill her before she can escape with it, but Bloodsport shoots him and takes it.\n\nStarro escapes the destroyed Jötunheim, kills the Thinker and much of the military, and begins taking control of the island's population. Waller tells the squad that their mission is complete and orders them to leave, but Bloodsport leads the team in fighting Starro. Waller attempts to execute them for this, but her subordinates knock her out. After Starro kills Polka-Dot Man, Harley pierces a hole in its eye, allowing Ratcatcher 2 to summon the city's rats to chew Starro to death from the inside. With the military diverted, Soria takes control of the government, promising democratic elections. Bloodsport blackmails Waller into releasing him and the surviving squad members and dropping Tyla's charges in exchange for keeping the contents of the drive confidential. Waller reluctantly agrees and the remaining squad members are airlifted out of Corto Maltese.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, it is revealed that Weasel, a member of the first team, has survived and runs off into the jungle. In a post-credits scene, Waller punishes her subordinates by assigning them to a new mission with Peacemaker, who is still alive and recovering in a hospital.[a]\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film's second Suicide Squad team includes  as ,  as ,  as the voice of , and  as .\n\n- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn:\nA crazed criminal and former psychiatrist.[6] Robbie said the film would show a new side of the character compared to her previous DC Extended Universe (DCEU) appearances due to her being in a new place and surrounded by new characters.[7] Despite inheriting this version of Harley from previous films, writer/director James Gunn loved the character and felt very comfortable writing for her. He wanted her to be \"the most Harley of all Harleys\" depicted on film,[8] including making \"healthy\" choices, following her toxic relationship with the Joker, that other people would find insane.[9] He likened Harley's relationship with Bloodsport to the comedy duo Abbott and Costello, with Harley being Costello.[10]\n- Idris Elba as Robert DuBois / Bloodsport:\nA mercenary with a technologically advanced suit that he can use to create different gadgets and transforming weaponry (an adaptation of the comic book character's ability to manifest weapons).[11][12] After being convicted of shooting Superman with a Kryptonite bullet, Bloodsport shortens his prison sentence by joining Task Force X so he can help his daughter Tyla.[12] Gunn said each member of the Suicide Squad in the film was inspired by a different film genre,[12] and described Bloodsport as an unsentimental portrayal of a 1960s action hero like Steve McQueen, without their \"moral repercussions\".[10] The character's story in the film takes him from a \"toxic asshole to a true leader\".[13]\n- John Cena as Christopher Smith / Peacemaker:\nA ruthless, jingoistic killer who believes in achieving peace at any cost.[6][10][14] Gunn told Cena not to read any Peacemaker comics before filming, and Cena originally approached the role with an \"angular, drill sergeant, Full Metal Jacket–esque personality\" before Gunn told him to act like a \"douchey, bro-y Captain America\"[15] who could have appeared in a 1970s television series like Wonder Woman.[12] The character does not get as much exploration or development as the other members of the Suicide Squad, which is one of the reasons that Gunn decided to create the spin-off television series Peacemaker despite him originally intending for the character's apparent death in the film to be permanent.[16]\n- Joel Kinnaman as Colonel Rick Flag:\nThe field leader of the Suicide Squad.[6] Gunn said Flag was the character that changed the most compared to the first Suicide Squad (2016),[17] with Kinnaman describing this version as sillier, less jaded, more naive, and funnier.[18] Gunn said Kinnaman was not used to comedic acting but \"quickly showed a talent and an affinity\" for it.[13] Flag begins the film on the Suicide Squad team that Amanda Waller sends as a decoy, and a deleted scene would have explained that she did this because he made fun of an ugly shirt she was wearing. Gunn said Flag has grown sick of being taken advantage of and doing bad things, which leads to him disobeying Waller and being killed by Peacemaker.[16]\n- Sylvester Stallone as the voice of Nanaue / King Shark:\nA man-eating shark-human hybrid,[19][20] created with visual effects.[21] Steve Agee, a longtime friend of Gunn's, developed King Shark's portrayal on set. He was chosen partly because he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), and wore a wireframe version of a shark head as well as a body suit to further approximate the character's size and shape.[22] Gunn wanted the underlying story for King Shark to explore his loneliness as someone who wants to be part of the world and connect with other people, but is not able to due to his appearance. This is seen in moments where he pretends to read or looks longingly out a window at a couple who are together.[16]\n- Viola Davis as Amanda Waller:\nThe director of A.R.G.U.S. who runs the Task Force X program.[23] Gunn said Waller, along with the U.S. government, is the true villain of the film, which explores the different reactions that the Suicide Squad have to her asking them to cover up illegal experiments in Corto Maltese.[16] He added that there was \"no better Amanda Waller\" than Davis,[17] and said she was \"incredibly intimidating\" when portraying the character.[24]\n- David Dastmalchian as Abner Krill / Polka-Dot Man:\nAn \"experiment gone wrong\" in a suit covered with polka dots.[6][25] Gunn described Polka-Dot Man as \"the dumbest DC character of all time\" whom he hoped to turn into a tragic character,[26][27] with the film's version being infected with an interdimensional virus by his mother in an attempt to turn him into a superhero. The virus develops into colorful balls of acid under Krill's skin that cause him pain unless he expels them as polka-dot weapons or vomits them up.[28] Unbeknownst to Gunn, Dastmalchian felt a personal connection to the character because he has the skin condition vitiligo, for which he was bullied as a child and called \"polka dots\".[29]\n- Daniela Melchior as Cleo Cazo / Ratcatcher 2:\nA thief who inherited the mantle of \"Ratcatcher\" from her father, along with equipment that allows her to control rats and communicate with them.[30] Gunn described her as the \"heart of the film\",[31] and noted that she is different from the other characters because she had her father's love growing up where the other characters had problematic relationships with their parents. Gunn explained that the moment where Ratcatcher 2 covers Bloodsport to protect him from the rats at the end of the film signifies her being able to share her father's love with him, which is why the moment is intercut with a flashback of her sitting with her father.[16]\n- Michael Rooker as Brian Durlin / Savant: a hand-to-hand combat and weapons expert.[32][33] He is killed in the opening scene when Waller detonates a bomb in his head for deserting the mission.[34]\n- Jai Courtney as Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang: an unhinged Australian thief who wields boomerangs.[35] Courtney said the character was \"the same shitbag liability\" he was in the first film.[36]\n- Peter Capaldi as Gaius Grieves / The Thinker: the lead scientist of Project Starfish,[23][37] who has been experimenting on Starro the Conqueror on behalf of the U.S. government.[38]\n- Alice Braga as Sol Soria: the leader of a rebel faction on Corto Maltese who aligns herself with the Suicide Squad.[6][39]\n- Pete Davidson as Richard \"Dick\" Hertz / Blackguard: an easily manipulated mercenary.[6][40] He betrays the first Suicide Squad team to the Corto Maltese military, who then kill him.[34]\n\nIn addition to playing King Shark on set, Steve Agee portrays John Economos, an A.R.G.U.S. agent who is an aide to Waller.[41][42] Other aides to Waller include Jennifer Holland as Emilia Harcourt and Tinashe Kajese as Flo Crawley, the aide who knocked out Amanda Waller before she could execute the squad and was later arrested in Peacemaker.[41][43] The ill-fated first Suicide Squad team includes Savant, Captain Boomerang, and Blackguard, as well as Nathan Fillion as Cory Pitzner / T.D.K. (The Detachable Kid), a metahuman who can detach his arms from his body;[6][14][44] Flula Borg as Gunter Braun / Javelin, a former Olympic athlete who wields javelins as weapons;[6][32][45] Mayling Ng as Mongal, an alien mass murderer;[6][46] and Sean Gunn as Weasel, an anthropomorphic weasel whose portrayal is based on Bill the Cat from the comic strip Bloom County. James Gunn said Weasel was \"barely more than an animal\" which raised some ethical questions about his involvement in the squad.[11][47]\n\nAlso appearing in the film are Juan Diego Botto as President General Silvio Luna, the dictator of Corto Maltese who proposes marriage to Harley Quinn;[39] Joaquín Cosío as Major General Mateo Suárez of Corto Maltese;[39] Storm Reid as Bloodsport's daughter Tyla;[23] Julio Ruiz as Milton, an associate of Task Force X;[48][49] Lynne Ashe as Polka-Dot Man's Mom;[28] and Taika Waititi as Ratcatcher 2's father, the original Ratcatcher.[31] In addition to Weasel, Sean Gunn also portrays Calendar Man, one of several DC villains that appear as Belle Reve inmates. Others include Natalia Safran as Kaleidoscope and Jared Leland Gore as Double Down.[50] John Ostrander, creator of the 1980s Suicide Squad team that influenced the film, makes a cameo appearance as Dr. Fitzgibbon,[23][51] while Stephen Blackehart has a small role as the pilot Briscoe,[52] and both Lloyd Kaufman and Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) collaborator Pom Klementieff appear as dancers in a nightclub in uncredited appearances.[39] Ratcatcher 2's pet rat Sebastian was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker and portrayed on-set by rats named Jaws and Crisp Ratt.[39][53]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\n#### Original plans\n\nDavid Ayer was initially set to return as director from the first Suicide Squad, but chose to work on other projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBefore the first Suicide Squad film was released in August 2016, director David Ayer and star Will Smith were expected to return for a sequel. Filming was planned to begin in 2017 after the pair completed their work on the film Bright (2017).[54] Karen Fukuhara expressed her interest in fleshing out Tatsu Yamashiro / Katana's backstory in a sequel, though she also noted that if not, that could be in a spin-off film of her own.[55] In September, Ayer said the first film had been rated PG-13 because it had originally been envisioned that way by the studio, and an R-rating needed to be planned from the start of a production. He said that it would be worth \"lobbying\" to make a sequel R-rated, as he felt the first film had the \"edge\" and \"attitude\" of an R-rated film already.[56] Suicide Squad was released to a polarized response and was reported to have a difficult production, but the film grossed enough for Warner Bros. Pictures to fast-track development of a sequel.[57][58] Several spin-off films were also in development by December, including one featuring Smith as Deadshot. The project that was furthest along was Gotham City Sirens, an all-female team-up film with Margot Robbie planned to reprise her role as Harley Quinn. Ayer was set to direct and produce that film rather than Suicide Squad 2.[57]\n\nWarner Bros. began searching for a new director for Suicide Squad 2, and was courting Mel Gibson by mid-February 2017.[58] Ruben Fleischer, Daniel Espinosa, Jonathan Levine, and David S. Goyer were also considered.[59][60] Adam Cozad entered negotiations to write the film a month later, at which point there was still no director attached to the project. It was described as being a priority for Warner Bros.[61] Script delays led to the planned filming start being pushed to mid-2018, at which point Gibson moved on from the project. Jaume Collet-Serra became the new frontrunner to direct in early July,[62] by which time both Smith and Robbie were set to reprise their roles.[62] Zak Penn had pitched a new story treatment for the film to Warner Bros.,[63] and wrote a draft of the script as a favor to the studio.[63][64] Later in July, Collet-Serra was hired to direct Disney's Jungle Cruise (2021) and withdrew from directing Suicide Squad 2 after deciding he would rather originate a new story than continue an existing franchise;[65] Collet-Serra went on to direct the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film Black Adam (2022).[66]\n\nIn August, Jared Leto was expected to reprise his role as the Joker from the first film,[67] while production was not expected to begin until Smith completed his work on Aladdin (2019) and Gemini Man (2019) in late 2018.[68] The next month, Gavin O'Connor was chosen to direct the film and co-write it with his writing partner Anthony Tambakis, based on his own vision.[69][70] The character Black Adam was reportedly the main villain of O'Connor's script, with Dwayne Johnson already attached to that role for DC Films.[71][72] Michael De Luca joined the film as a producer in January 2018, working with the first film's producer Charles Roven.[73] David Bar Katz and Todd Stashwick were co-writing the film with O'Connor in June,[74] and they had completed their draft by that September.[75] O'Connor left the film by early October to focus on The Way Back (2020). This was reportedly out of frustration that Warner Bros. was already moving ahead with Birds of Prey (2020), a new Harley Quinn spin-off film with a similar story to the one he wrote for Suicide Squad 2.[76] During the development process, the character Deathstroke appeared in four or five different versions of the script to fight Deadshot. Joe Manganiello was attached to reprise his role as Deathstroke from Justice League (2017), and the experience left him feeling that he would never portray the character again until he was asked to return for Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021).[77][78]\n\n#### James Gunn\n\nJames Gunn, writer and director of The Suicide Squad\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn October 2018, James Gunn was hired to write and possibly direct the next Suicide Squad film.[79] His deal with Warner Bros. closed following the completion of his exit settlement with the Walt Disney Company, after he was dismissed by Disney and Marvel Studios as director of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) in July 2018 when conservative commentators, such as Mike Cernovich, circulated controversial Twitter posts he made involving rape, pedophilia, AIDS, the Holocaust, bestiality and 9/11.[80] Warner Bros. had been interested in recruiting Gunn for the DCEU immediately after his dismissal by Disney[81] and asked him to make a new Superman film.[10][82] Gunn was uncertain if he wanted to take on Superman, so Warner Bros. told him that he could adapt any DC property he liked. He chose to make a Suicide Squad film, recalling that it was the one DC property he dreamed of adapting and had been jealous when Ayer's Suicide Squad film performed well.[10] Ayer supported Gunn's hiring as a \"brave and smart move\" and called him \"the right man for the job\". Dave Bautista, who starred in the Guardians of the Galaxy films for Gunn, expressed interest in appearing in his Suicide Squad film.[83]\n\nOne of the first things Gunn did when discussing the film with Warner Bros. was watch Suicide Squad for the first time. The studio said he could take or leave any elements he wanted from the first film, but they hoped that he would bring back Robbie as Harley Quinn.[24] The day after he was hired, Disney decided to reinstate Gunn as director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He discussed his new DCEU commitment with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, who encouraged him to \"make a great movie\" and agreed to delay production on Guardians until Gunn had completed work on the Suicide Squad sequel.[84] In January 2019, the film was officially titled The Suicide Squad and was scheduled for release on August 6, 2021.[85] The title was suggested by Gunn as a joke, but executives at Warner Bros. liked it.[86] At that time, Gunn was in negotiations to direct the film which was described as a relaunch rather than a direct sequel that would take the franchise in a new direction and feature a largely new cast. Roven and Peter Safran were set as producers, with Zack Snyder and Deborah Snyder as executive producers.[87] Safran, who produced the DCEU films Aquaman (2018) and Shazam! (2019), had pushed Gunn to take on the project and felt there was no better director to \"bring together a disparate group of outsiders on a mission\".[88]\n\n### Writing\n\nWe really wanted to make sure that this stands on its own two feet. So... it's not a sequel, but there are some characters that were in the first movie, right? So it's not really a full reboot either. So we just call it James Gunn's The Suicide Squad.\n\nGunn wrote a treatment that was a few pages long,[16] and then quickly produced several drafts of the script that Warner Bros. was \"extremely high\" on.[89] He said the film was \"its own thing\", rather than a sequel or reboot;[90] it does not explicitly address the events of the first film or Birds of Prey,[91] but it also does not contradict them.[90] Warner Bros. asked Gunn to make the film PG-13, but he insisted on it being R-rated if he was going to direct it; the studio felt Gunn's involvement was \"worth the trade-off\" for the higher rating.[8] He took inspiration from John Ostrander's original 1980s run on the Suicide Squad comic books,[23] which he was drawn to because it was about a \"bunch of loser, B-grade supervillains\".[12] Safran described The Suicide Squad as a \"gritty 1970s war movie combined with the brilliance of James Gunn's characters and comedy\",[92] and Gunn was influenced by war films such as The Great Escape (1963), The Dirty Dozen (1967), Where Eagles Dare (1968), and Kelly's Heroes (1970).[10][23][93]\n\nAlready knowing the kind of story that he wanted to tell, Gunn's first step in writing the film was picking the characters for the Suicide Squad roster. He spent days going through the library of existing DC Comics characters and deciding which group would work well together. He wanted to create a blend of characters by having each feel like they were part of a different film genre.[16] The first new character that Gunn added to the roster was King Shark,[94] who was intended to appear in the first film before being replaced by Killer Croc.[95] Gunn sought to feature an animal on the team, and chose King Shark because he enjoyed the concept of a man-eating fish-human hybrid.[94] Other new characters that Gunn added include Polka-Dot Man, Peacemaker, and a female version of Ratcatcher.[96] He said one of the main differences between this film and the Guardians of the Galaxy films was that it would be unclear whether some Suicide Squad members would turn out to be good or bad, unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy who are portrayed as heroes despite their flaws.[90] Characters that were considered but ultimately rejected include Sportsmaster,[97] Dogwelder,[98] Bat-Mite,[23] Livewire, Punch and Jewelee, Black Spider, Deathstroke, Man-Bat, Plastique, Chemo, KGBeast, Solomon Grundy, Rainbow Creature, Gunhawk, Knockout, Killer Frost, Mr. Freeze,[99][100][101] and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's Black Manta from Aquaman.[102] He did not consider using the Joker because he felt Amanda Waller would not have any use for the character,[103] and chose not to use Kite Man because he felt the character was already a punchline in the comics and would not feel fresh for the film.[104] Gunn also avoided characters like Bronze Tiger and Katana since they are antiheroes rather than villains.[105]\n\nGunn felt he was in a position, and had the responsibility, to take risks with the property and try make \"an all-out entertaining film from start to finish that didn't play by the rules\". This included \"post-modern\" aesthetic decisions such as creating sequences that showed the perspectives of Harley Quinn and Polka-Dot Man, adding an extended subplot where Harley Quinn is on her own away from the action, and adding title cards that segue between sequences.[9] These elements were written into the script,[16] including what Gunn referred to as \"Harley-vision\" where gory murders are depicted through Harley's \"starry-eyed way of looking at life\" by mixing \"hearts and beautiful little things\" with the blood that is coming out of the people Harley is killing. The \"Harley-vision\" visuals were inspired by a video game that Gunn helped develop called Lollipop Chainsaw (2012).[8]\n\nThe main villains of the film are Amanda Waller and the U.S. government, who are trying to cover up their involvement in illegal experiments on the island of Corto Maltese. Gunn did not feel that this storyline was specifically critical of the U.S. government, just realistic given the real-world history of the U.S. interfering in other countries. He also wanted to use this to make dramatic points rather than political ones, with the different stances on the government's actions that the film's main characters take leading to dramatic conflict.[16] For the antagonist that Waller sends the Suicide Squad to fight, Gunn initially considered using Superman before deciding to feature Starro the Conqueror instead.[16] He found the character to be both ridiculous and terrifying, which reflected what he was trying to accomplish with the film,[10] and he felt Starro was the only major DC Comics villain that was unlikely to appear in another live-action film or who would not be adapted faithfully by another filmmaker if it was. He also wanted to avoid potential questions regarding who should be portraying Superman in the DCEU and what that would mean for the film's connections to the wider shared universe.[16] DC allowed Gunn to kill any character,[90] including Harley Quinn,[106] and he ignored the potential backlash from doing this to prioritize the natural evolution of the story.[10] He did not want it to be like other films which might kill off some characters early on but then not kill any of the main characters at the end, so he knew that one of the Suicide Squad members would die during the final battle. He originally intended for this to be Ratcatcher, but ultimately felt that this would be too heartless. He chose Polka-Dot Man instead because he thought the character had the most complete story arc at that point in the film.[16]\n\n### Casting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReprising their roles from the first  film are  as ,  as Colonel ,  as , and  as .\n\nWhen acknowledging the first film's negative reception, Gunn said there were aspects of it that he loved and defended Ayer's casting choices;[10][90] the first decision Gunn made on the new film was to bring back Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.[10][94] On February 27, 2019, Smith was revealed to no longer be in the film's cast due to scheduling issues.[107] On March 1, Gunn met with Idris Elba to discuss him joining the film, reportedly as a replacement for Smith as Deadshot. Elba was Gunn's only choice for the role,[89] and he wrote the script with Elba in mind—something Gunn rarely does for actors he has not met.[108] Elba agreed to join the film during that conversation,[109] as he wanted to work with Gunn and felt \"so touched and honored that someone of [Gunn's] talent was really keen to work with\" him.[110] Elba was in official negotiations the next week. Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag was expected to return from the first film at that point,[89] and Jai Courtney revealed later that month that he was returning as Captain Boomerang from the first film.[35] Scott Eastwood, who played GQ Edwards in the first film, was approached to reprise his role by Warner Bros. offering him a three-picture deal for more Suicide Squad movies, but the studio didn't wish to pay him for those movies nor send him a script, leading Eastwood to be unaware of the plans he was signing up for, so after seeking advice from his father Clint, Scott declined to return because he didn't feel Warner really needed him back and wasn't answering his questions.[111] In April, the film's creative team decided that Elba would play a new character rather than Deadshot. This decision was made, following weeks of discussions that included Gunn and Elba, to be respectful to Smith and allow him the option to return to the role in the future.[109] Elba later stated that Gunn never intended to cast him as Deadshot,[110] while Gunn said he changed his mind about who Elba would portray \"a lot\".[16] Gunn ultimately chose to cast Elba as Bloodsport because he liked the character in the comics.[11] Though the film has an ensemble cast, Gunn felt Bloodsport was the main protagonist due to being the most prominent and because of the amount of character growth that he goes through.[16]\n\nGunn wrote King Shark with Sylvester Stallone in mind,[94][112] but tested three other voice actors before asking Stallone to join the film.[113] Stallone agreed to voice the character due to his experience working with Gunn on the MCU film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).[94][112] Gunn was looking to cast Bautista as Peacemaker,[96] but the actor had a scheduling conflict with Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead (2021).[114][115] John Cena entered talks for a role in the film that was believed to be Peacemaker in late April,[114][116] as Gunn had wanted to work with Cena since seeing his performance in Trainwreck (2015).[117] Cena made numerous unsuccessful attempts to join the DCEU prior to his casting in this film.[15] David Dastmalchian and Daniela Melchior were respectively cast as Polka-Dot Man and Ratcatcher 2 at the end of April.[118][119] Gunn said the role of Polka-Dot Man was \"tailor made\" for Dastmalchian, who had been friends with Gunn for a long time.[8] In contrast, Melchior was cast from a group of 200 actors.[120] She did a chemistry test with live rats as part of her audition process because her character controls rats in the film and had to interact with them on set.[110] Gunn's frequent collaborator Michael Rooker was in talks to join the cast in May,[121] while Storm Reid was cast as the daughter of Elba's character in July.[122] Flula Borg, Nathan Fillion, and Steve Agee joined the film in August,[123][124][125] with Agee initially reported to be portraying King Shark.[125] Also in August, Taika Waititi entered negotiations for a role.[126] Peter Capaldi joined the cast in early September, when Pete Davidson was in talks to make a cameo appearance during a break from his work on Saturday Night Live.[127] Davidson agreed to join the film because his character is called \"Dick Hertz\", which Davidson found to be funny.[40]\n\nA table read for the film with the full cast was held on September 11, ahead of the start of filming later that month.[126] Gunn later announced the film's full main cast and characters: Dastmalchian as Polka-Dot Man, Cena as Peacemaker, Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Joaquín Cosío as Mateo Suarez, Fillion as T.D.K., Kinnaman as Rick Flag, Mayling Ng as Mongal, Borg as Javelin, his brother Sean Gunn as Weasel, Juan Diego Botto as Silvio Luna, Reid as Tyla, Davidson as Blackguard, Waititi as the first Ratcatcher, Alice Braga as Sol Soria, Agee, Tinashe Kajese as Flo Crawley, Melchior as Ratcatcher 2, Capaldi as Thinker, Julio Ruiz as Milton, Jennifer Holland as Emilia Harcourt, Davis as Waller, Elba as Bloodsport, Robbie as Quinn, and Rooker as Savant.[6][23][31][41][48][49] Agee was the on-set reference for King Shark,[92] and also portrays John Economos.[42]\n\n### Design\n\nProduction designer Beth Mickle said Gunn wanted the film to be \"grey and drab and monotone\" until the characters arrive in Corto Maltese, which he wanted to \"explode with color\" like Panama and Cuba.[27] The design team took inspiration from photos of Havana, Cuba, and São Paulo, Brazil.[17] Gunn said the film featured the biggest sets ever built for a Warner Bros. film,[27] with Mickle building a set the size of three football fields for the outside of Jötunheim where the final battle was filmed,[128] and an even bigger beach set that had real waves and a palm tree forest which Gunn called \"the greatest set [he had] ever been on\".[8] The jungle featured a bamboo cage that was 8 feet (2.4 m) deep.[93] Gunn said building a whole beach was expensive, but it was more cost-effective than using a real beach due to changing tides and the limited amount of time available for filming in a real environment.[8]\n\nBecause of the mixture of characters that Gunn selected for the film's Suicide Squad roster, there are \"dorky comics costumes\" alongside \"modern, scary, grimdark\" costumes.[129] One of the biggest costume challenges for Gunn was creating Bloodsport's suit, from which the character can form various weapons.[13] Robbie wears a new costume that features Harley's traditional red and black color palette, with Gunn taking inspiration from the character's costume in the video game Batman: Arkham City (2011). He wanted her jacket to have \"motorcycle gang style\"-writing on the back, and chose \"Live fast, die clown\" over other potential options \"Clown AF\" and \"World's Best Grandpa\".[11] Gunn also removed Harley's \"Rotten\" facial tattoo that she had in previous DCEU films because both he and Robbie disliked it.[130] Flag wears a yellow T-shirt with a cartoon character called \"Ultra Bunny\" on it. Gunn drew the character, and added the text \"obstacles are opportunities\" which is his slogan when directing on set.[13] Gunn initially used a hammerhead shark design from the New 52 comics for King Shark, but found that it would be awkward to film the character with other actors due to his eyes being on the sides of his head.[131] Gunn settled on a great white shark design that is similar to the one seen in the Harley Quinn animated series, though this was a coincidence as that series was released after filming for The Suicide Squad began.[132] Gunn gave King Shark a dad bod to make him look less like a mammal,[133] as well as small eyes, a big mouth, and a small head to avoid the \"cute anthropomorphic beast\" design seen in popular characters like Baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and The Mandalorian (2019–present)'s Grogu.[134]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 20, 2019, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[127][135] under the working title El Dorado.[136] Henry Braham served as cinematographer, after previously doing so for Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[137] Feige and Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito visited the set during filming.[138] Gunn took several precautions to try to avoid details about the film leaking, such as referring to Elba's character in the script and on set as \"Vigilante\" to prevent his actual role from being revealed, and also not giving some of the actors script pages from after their characters' deaths.[139]\n\nGunn extensively storyboards his films, but the opening shot of The Suicide Squad—in which the camera rotates out of a puddle's reflection on the ground to reveal Savant bouncing a ball—was a spontaneous decision that he made on set when he saw the reflections on the ground. For a scene where Bloodsport smokes a cigarette, Elba—who has asthma and does not smoke himself—was left with tears in his eyes that had to be removed digitally since Gunn otherwise liked the shot.[13] Gunn said the film used more practical effects than any other blockbuster comic book film, with on-set special effects provided by Dan Sudick and prosthetics created by Legacy Effects.[140] Gunn highlighted a shot in the film where King Shark, who is created with visual effects, rips a person in half, which was done practically using special effects and prosthetics.[21] Stunt supervisor Guy Norris served as second unit director for the car scenes in the film.[8] Gunn explained that he rarely uses second unit directors on his films and has never liked working with them, but he enjoyed the experience of working with Norris as he was not comfortable shooting with cars and had already known Norris for a long time.[141][8]\n\nFilming in Atlanta was expected to last three months before moving to Panama for a month,[142] with Colón, Panama standing in for the streets of Corto Maltese. Gunn said the city was \"beautiful but falling-apart... we were able to use all the colors but to keep the grime\" as well.[17] The cast and crew rescued several animals from the streets of Panama.[13] Filming also took place in Porto, Portugal,[143] and wrapped on February 28, 2020.[144]\n\n### Editing\n\nFred Raskin and Christian Wagner served as editors on the film.[16] Raskin previously worked alongside Gunn on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[145] By April 2020, Gunn was editing the film at his home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said had not affected post-production or the release schedule at that time.[146] The initial assembly cut for the film was around two hours and forty minutes long, and around twenty minutes of that was soon cut down during editing.[8] Gunn felt the film was still too long, and removed some elements such as part of Harley Quinn's separate storyline that he felt was \"pushing audiences away a little bit too much\",[120] as well as a sequence with Ratcatcher, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and the Thinker when they exit a Corto Maltese bar. Gunn felt the latter was \"pretty dynamite stuff\" but it was slowing down the film and at the wrong time.[8] A smaller scene that was cut involved Waller's aide Flo Crawley being arrested for knocking Waller out during the final battle; Gunn explained that this was a mostly unnecessary detail which made the audience feel uncomfortable since it felt less like the villain, Waller, had lost, but he included the moment in a recap of the film that begins the spin-off series Peacemaker to explain why Crawley is not in that series.[147] In December, Gunn said editing for the film's final cut had been completed and work on the remaining visual effects, sound, and score was continuing.[148] The final runtime is two hours and twelve minutes.[1]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nKelvin McIlwain was the visual effects supervisor for the film, with visual effects vendors including Framestore, Weta Digital, Trixter, Scanline VFX, and Cantina Creative.[149] Gunn said the visual effects for King Shark, primarily handled by Framestore and Weta Digital, were particularly difficult to get right.[8]\n\n### Music\n\nIn May 2020, John Murphy was set as the composer for the film.[150] Tyler Bates, who scored all of Gunn's previous films, was originally attached to compose the score for The Suicide Squad but eventually left the project. During pre-production, Bates wrote music for Gunn to use on set as he had previously done for Gunn on the Guardians of the Galaxy films.[151] The single \"Rain\" by grandson and Jessie Reyez from the film's soundtrack album was released on June 22, 2021, with the artists also expected to contribute songs individually to the album.[152] A single from Murphy's score, \"So This Is The Famous Suicide Squad\", was made available on July 8.[153] On August 6, two full albums for the film were released by WaterTower Music: one featuring Murphy's score, and a soundtrack album featuring songs from the film, including \"Rain\".[154][155]\n\n### Completion\n\nIn January 2021, at the beginning of filming for Peacemaker in Vancouver, Canada, Gunn filmed a post-credits scene for The Suicide Squad that sets-up the series.[5] He had not planned an alternative post-credits scene before deciding to make Peacemaker.[8] A month later, the film was fully finished. Gunn said Warner Bros. had not interfered with his vision for the film and had only given a few minor notes.[156] He added that The Suicide Squad was the most fun he had making a film, which he attributed to prioritizing creativity over perfectionism, being in the best place mentally and emotionally of his career, having a \"stupendous\" cast and crew and supportive studio, and feeling that he was at the height of his directing abilities with the film.[157] It came in under budget and had no days of additional photography.[158] In July, the film's release date was moved up by a day to August 5.[159]\n\n## Marketing\n\nA behind-the-scenes featurette was released on August 22, 2020, during the virtual DC FanDome event.[160] A panel for the film was held during Comic Con Experience's digital event CCXP Worlds on December 6, with James Gunn and members of the cast in attendance. The cast members discussed their characters, and a design for Elba's costume as Bloodsport was revealed.[12] Cena decided to wear the Peacemaker costume for interviews and other promotional events as a way to familiarize the audience with the lesser-known character, which was a tactic that he had previously used when he was a professional wrestler.[161]\n\nThe film's first trailer was released on March 26, 2021, with Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club praising its jokes and action. He felt everything about the trailer perfectly captured the Suicide Squad's inherent \"outlandish fun\" from the comics.[162] Anthony D'Alessandro at Deadline Hollywood felt the trailer had all the trademarks of Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy films, noting the use of a \"retro hit single\" in Steely Dan's \"Dirty Work\",[163] with The Verge's Jay Peters also getting \"some serious Guardians of the Galaxy vibes\" from the trailer.[20] D'Alessandro and Peters both compared it to the recently released DC film Zack Snyder's Justice League and noted how the trailer was much more colorful and humorous than that film.[20][163] McLevy, Jennifer Bisset and Sean Keane of CNET, and CinemaBlend's Sean O'Connell all highlighted King Shark and his R-rated scenes.[162][164][165] The trailer was viewed 150 million times within a week of its release, breaking the record for red band trailers that was established earlier in the year by the trailer for Mortal Kombat (2021).[166]\n\nA green band trailer was released online on April Fool's Day, after debuting in front of theatrical screenings of Godzilla vs. Kong (2021). It features new footage because Gunn did not want to use an edited version of the red band trailer as is usually done. Jennifer Ouellette at Ars Technica noted that the new trailer had a darker, more ominous tone than the red band version, without the jokes and King Shark scenes and with added character beats.[167] Another trailer was released on June 22 by the main cast of the film in a marketing stunt where they pretended that they were leaking the trailer early. Gunn and Warner Bros. also joked about the trailer's \"early release\".[168] The trailer features the song \"Rain\" by grandson and Jessie Reyez from the film's soundtrack album.[152] Footage from the film is included in the music video for \"Rain\", which was released the next month.[169]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical and streaming\n\nThe Suicide Squad premiered theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 30, 2021.[170] It was scheduled to debut in the United States on August 6,[85] but was moved up a day to August 5, for early preview screenings.[159] The film was also made available on the streaming service HBO Max on August 5, for a one-month premiere streaming window. This was done as part of Warner Bros.'s joint theatrical and streaming release strategy for 2021 films that was announced in December 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[171] Reflecting on this release strategy in January 2022, Gunn acknowledged suggestions that it negatively impacted on the film's box office performance and said the approach was not ideal for the film. He added that the film was widely pirated following its streaming debut,[172] with a high quality version of the film appearing on piracy websites almost immediately after it was released on HBO Max.[173] Internet technology company Akamai reported, based on global unlicensed streaming and torrent data, that The Suicide Squad was the sixth most pirated film between January and September 2021.[174] Despite this, Gunn was grateful that people had been able to see the film online during the pandemic and that it had otherwise been well received.[172]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was made available for digital purchase and rental on September 17, 2021, after leaving its HBO Max same day premiere window. The Suicide Squad was then released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 26, with special features including a commentary by Gunn, deleted and extended scenes, a gag reel, three retro style trailers, breakdowns of key scenes from the film, and several making-of featurettes.[175] The film was the top-seller for home media sales in the United States for two weeks after its release, on both the NPD Videoscan First Alert chart (which tracks combined Blu-ray and DVD sales) and the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart.[176][177] According to The Numbers, it sold a combined 146,752 Blu-ray and DVD units in its first week for a total of $3.8 million.[4] It was the fourth highest-selling title for the month of October on the VideoScan First Alert chart.[178]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Suicide Squad grossed $55.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $112.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $169 million, against a production budget of $185 million.[3][4]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film made $12.2 million on its first day, including $4.1 million from Thursday night previews, which was the biggest first day for an R-rated film during the pandemic. That contributed to $26.2 million (47.0% of total gross) across the film's opening weekend, which was also the biggest for an R-rated film during the pandemic. Despite the pandemic-era records, the film fell short of Warner Bros. and industry projections of a $30 million opening, projections that themselves were considered low and were closer to the underperforming Birds of Prey than the successful first Suicide Squad.[179] The film dropped 72% in its second weekend, finishing fifth with just $7.5 million. This drop was similar to those seen in the second weekends of other films released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max, such as Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021).[180] It dropped 55% in its third weekend, grossing $3.4 million,[181] before crossing $50 million in its fourth weekend with an additional $2 million.[182]\n\nThe week prior to its domestic release, the film made $6.7 million from five countries, including $4.5 million in the United Kingdom and $1.6 million in France.[183][184] The Suicide Squad expanded to 69 countries, covering all major markets except Japan, in its second week of international release. It made $35 million, finishing first in Russia ($4.2 million), Mexico ($2 million), Brazil ($1.4 million), Spain ($1.3 million), and Italy ($1 million), and only dropped 25% in markets that it opened in the previous week. Even when taking into account the pandemic limiting theaters in territories such as Italy, Australia, Mexico, and Southeast Asia, the weekend's total grosses were below expectations.[184] The film opened at number one in Japan the following week with $1.9 million, retained first position in Brazil, and moved to first in Australia as well. Overall, the weekend total was $17 million, down 50% from the previous week and behind new release Free Guy in many markets.[185] The film added $8.7 million in its fourth international weekend,[186] before passing $100 million internationally the next week with an additional $4.6 million.[187] The United Kingdom, Russia, France, Germany, and Mexico were the leading markets for the film outside of the U.S. and Canada.[186]\n\nThe film's box office underperformance was generally attributed to its release during the COVID-19 pandemic, the fact that it was also available for streaming on HBO Max at the same time as its theatrical release, piracy allowed by the streaming release, the R-rating which limited younger audiences, the poor reception to the first Suicide Squad, and confusion from general audiences over its relationship to the first film caused by their similar titles.[179][184][188][189][190] Anthony D'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood felt the HBO Max availability and feelings about the first film outweighed the impacts of the pandemic, and noted that other films had made significantly more money at the box office in recent weeks.[179] Writing for Forbes, Scott Mendelson felt that general audiences would not be compelled by Gunn's involvement and instead would see the film as a sequel without the main draws of the first film, such as Will Smith. Mendelson added that the film's $185 million budget was an \"absurd amount to spend\" on an R-rated film and was significantly more than what was spent on previous R-rated superhero films. He said the film required a \"best-case-scenario box office\" just to break even with that budget, and that did not turn out to be the case.[189]\n\n### Streaming viewership\n\nHBO Max reported that The Suicide Squad had the second-biggest opening weekend of all the films that premiered simultaneously on the streaming service and in theaters. The service did not provide further details or data,[188] but analytics company Samba TV, which gathers viewership data from certain Smart TVs and content providers, reported that 2.8 million U.S. households watched the film over its first four days of release on HBO Max, which placed it only behind Mortal Kombat (3.8 million) for simultaneous theater and streaming releases. Also according to Samba TV, The Suicide Squad had the biggest HBO Max debut for a DC film, ahead of both Wonder Woman 1984 (2.2 million) and Zack Snyder's Justice League (1.8 million).[191] While discussing Nielsen Media Research's streaming ratings—which HBO Max does not participate in—for the week of the film's release, Forbes's Scott Mendelson estimated that around 369 million minutes of the film had been viewed based on Samba TV's figures, which would have placed it third on Nielsen's list of top streaming films for the week behind Netflix's Vivo (493 million minutes) and Disney+'s Jungle Cruise (407 million minutes).[192]\n\nSamba TV later reported that 3.5 million American households had watched the film within its first week of release.[193] This grew to 4.7 million for the first 17 days, which placed it third after Mortal Kombat (5.5 million) and Godzilla vs. Kong (5.1 million).[194] These rankings remained the same for Samba TV's 30-day figures, which reported 5.1 million households having viewed The Suicide Squad in that time.[195] According to Whip Media, who track viewership data for the 19 million worldwide users of their TV Time app, The Suicide Squad was the seventh-most-streamed-film of 2021 and the most-streamed-project of the year for HBO Max.[196]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Suicide Squad holds an approval rating of 90% based on 386 reviews, with an average score of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Enlivened by writer-director James Gunn's singularly skewed vision, The Suicide Squad marks a funny, fast-paced rebound that plays to the source material's violent, anarchic strengths.\"[197] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score that the first film and Birds of Prey received, while PostTrak reported that 83% of audience members gave it a positive score compared to 73% for the first film. 62% told PostTrak that they would definitely recommend the film.[179]\n\nReviewing for The A.V. Club, Katie Rife gave the film a \"B+\" grade and said, \"Now that superhero movies have gone from disreputable entertainment for children to global events ushered in with awed reverence, it was time for someone to come along and pop the balloon. Pulpy and outrageous, irreverent and ultraviolent, The Suicide Squad does so with a smile.\"[199] Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman called the film what \"the first Suicide Squad should have been\" and said that \"The Suicide Squad comes sizzlingly alive as all-cylinders comic-book moviemaking. There's a frowsy destructive joy to the staging\".[200] Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent also praised the film and considered it an improvement over Suicide Squad, writing \"Gunn's distinct and self-assured vision, which he's said was left untouched and unbothered by studio interference, puts The Suicide Squad alongside the very best of modern comic-book filmmaking. His film, which now comes with an all-important 'The' at the beginning of its title, functions both as a sequel and a fresh start.\"[201] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and said \"The Suicide Squad shifts superhero movies into a hilarious, gory and exceedingly bonkers new direction but writer/director James Gunn still makes time to show one goofy supervillain making sure another's buckled up for a plane ride headed for certain doom\" and also said that the film \"is a bloody marvel that blows up the superhero genre.\"[202]\n\nJustin Chang from Los Angeles Times stated: \"After 2016's ugly, bludgeoning Suicide Squad, I couldn't imagine liking—and could barely stomach the idea of seeing—another movie called Suicide Squad. I'm delighted to be proven wrong\", and called the film \"redemption for James Gunn and DC\".[203] Richard Trenholm of CNET gave the film a positive review and praised it for its themes, writing \"This irreverent comic book movie takes shots at very big and serious themes, raging against Western imperialism, American foreign policy and government deception as it indicts interference in foreign countries. Representing this chilling bureaucratic evil, Amanda Waller emerges as perhaps the most hateful villain in the DC universe — certainly the coldest\".[204] Alonso Duralde of the TheWrap wrote: \"The Suicide Squad is by no means perfect, but like the Deadpool movies, it's a showcase for what can happen when a superhero movie is allowed to be sprightly, self-aware, and sardonic while also indulging in hard-R violence, gore, and language. Gunn's latest creation is not without moments that drag, but when it pops, it pops brilliantly\".[205] Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt gave the film a C+ grade and wrote: \"The script, accordingly, herks and jerks along with a sort of forced-festive glee, its mounting body count buffeted by goofball banter and pounding soundtrack cues. A good half of the jokes don't land, but unlike his predecessor's joyless slog, Gunn's version at least celebrates the nonsense.\"[206] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and called it \"a long, loud, often enjoyable and amusing film that blitzes your eyeballs and eardrums and covers all the bases\".[207]\n\n### Themes and analysis\n\nSome critics have interpreted The Suicide Squad as a critique and even a parody of American foreign policy and noted some anti-imperialist themes, which was arguably done in greater extent than the film's predecessor. Noah Berlatsky of Foreign Policy compares the rationale of the Suicide Squad's intervention in the Corto Maltese civil war to the 2003 invasion of Iraq on the grounds of an anti-American regime purportedly gaining access to and weaponizing a destructive force such as Starro. He also notes that American interference in Corto Maltese is \"as every bit as disastrous as the 2003 Iraq invasion,\" also commenting that The Suicide Squad depicts the U.S. government as \"bumbling\" and \"corrupt\", citing the squad's accidental slaughter of the very fighters they were supposed to protect and Amanda Waller's desire to cover up America's role in Project Starfish and ambivalence towards Starro's rampage.[208] Reuben Baron of Comic Book Resources compares the torture and experimentation of Corto Maltese civilians in Project Starfish to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal and allegations of prisoner torture at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He opines that the evil actions of Silvio Luna's regime and Starro, while heinous, are \"just symptomatic of the ultimate villain of The Suicide Squad: the United States government,\" describing Peacemaker's betrayal of the team as \"misguided patriotism\", and that the \"heroes in this movie are those who are willing to defy the orders given to them by the government\".[209] Lucy Nichols of Counter Fire writes that the film \"bizarrely, openly critiques American imperialism in Latin America\", and like Baron, comments that The Suicide Squad is unusual among superhero films with its direct criticism of the U.S. government and military.[210]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                          | Date of ceremony    | Category

Cena stars as Peacemaker,[231] with Agee, Holland, and Davis also reprising their respective film roles.[42][43][232] Gunn and Safran executive produce the series,[231] which premiered in January 2022.[233]\n\n#### Untitled spin-off series\n\nGunn revealed in January 2022 that he was developing a new television project for DC,[234] and it was confirmed to be based on a character from The Suicide Squad at the end of the month. HBO Max had not greenlit the series, for which writing had yet to begin, but the streaming service was said to be \"high\" on the idea based on Gunn's enthusiasm for it.[235] The next month, Gunn said that they had been \"working heavily\" on the series and it had \"advanced a lot\", and said more details should be revealed soon.[229] The series was reported to feature Amanda Waller in May 2022,[236] but Gunn stated a month later that the series was separate from a potential Amanda Waller project though there would be \"some blending\" of characters from Peacemaker in the series.[237]\n\n### Unproduced sequel\n\nIn July 2021, Gunn said he had ideas for a sequel film that would go in a different direction from just assembling a new Suicide Squad team.[31] In June 2022, Gunn said there had been discussions about a sequel to The Suicide Squad and he was considering it for his next feature film but his focus was on television for the foreseeable future following his positive experience making Peacemaker.[237] The following June, Gunn said there would not be a sequel.[238]\n\n### DC Universe\n\nIn October 2022, The Suicide Squad director James Gunn and co-producer Peter Safran were announced to be assuming roles as the dual CEOs and chairmen of the newly established DC Studios, placing them in supervision over all DC Comics-based media between film, television, animation and video games.[239] Following the assumption of their new posts in November, the pair began devising an eight-to-ten year plan for a new interconnected DC Universe (DCU) franchise that would succeed and \"soft reboot\" the outgoing DCEU following the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom in December 2023.[240][241] Gunn and Safran later said that certain actors and their respective characters from The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker would appear in the new DCU, but that the events of both the film and the series would exist as a \"rough memory\" of events that transpired in the new canon.[242] He later clarified that The Suicide Squad would not be retroactively incorporated into the DCU and that certain events from that film would only carry over into the DCU's continuity if they were mentioned in DCU media.[243]\n\n#### Creature Commandos\n\nGunn had been working on a new series for DC following the success of Peacemaker and prior to his promotion.[244][245] The series was greenlit by Gunn himself following his assumption of duties at DC Studios,[246] and was revealed to be an animated series based on the Creature Commandos team in January 2023.[247] The series was positioned to be the first installment of Gunn and Safran's DCU, acting as an \"apertif\" to the franchise prior to the release of the film Superman (2025) which was regarded as the \"true beginning\" of the story.[248][249] The series takes place after and acknowledges several events from both The Suicide Squad and the first season of Peacemaker, notably establishing that in the aftermath of Leota Adebayo exposing A.R.G.U.S. director Amanda Waller for her involvement in creating the Suicide Squad, she was barred from exploiting any other human inmates at Belle Reve for her black ops missions, leading her to devise a team composed exclusively of monsters and other inhuman subjects.[250] The team's leader Rick Flag Sr., is the father of the DCEU's Rick Flag Jr., who was acknowledged as having been killed in action during \"Project Starfish\", the Corto Maltese-based mission during the events of The Suicide Squad.[251][252] Numerous cast members from The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker also appear in the series, with Viola Davis and Steve Agee respectively reprising their roles as Amanda Waller and A.R.G.U.S. agent John Economos.[253][254] The Suicide Squad actor Sean Gunn reprises his role as Weasel and voices G.I. Robot, who are both members of the Creature Commandos.[255][256] The first season of the series had a two-episode premiere on December 5, 2024 and ran for eight episodes, concluding on January 9, 2025.[257] It has been renewed for a second season.[258]\n\n#### Peacemaker season 2\n\nIn February 2022, HBO Max renewed Peacemaker for an eight-episode second season, with James Gunn returning as writer, showrunner, and director of all episodes.[259] John Cena will reprise his DCEU role as Christopher Smith / Peacemaker in season 2,[260] with Freddie Stroma, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Holland, Steve Agee, Robert Patrick and Nhut Le also returning as their respective characters from the first season.[261][262]\n\n#### Waller\n\nA spin-off series featuring Amanda Waller was revealed in May 2022, with Christal Henry writing and serving as executive producer alongside Gunn and Safran. Davis was in negotiations to reprise her role and also executive produce the series, which was expected to build off Waller's appearances in Peacemaker which publicly revealed her work with the Suicide Squad.[236] The series was revealed to be titled Waller in January 2023.[263]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ This scene sets up the events of the spin-off television series Peacemaker (2022–present)[5]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"The Suicide Squad (15)\".

It is a standalone sequel to Suicide Squad (2016) and the tenth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The film was written and directed by <Director>James Gunn</Director> and stars Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Sylvester Stallone, Viola Davis, David Dastmalchian, Daniela Melchior, Michael Rooker, Jai Courtney, Peter Capaldi, Alice Braga, and Pete Davidson. \n\nIn the film, several convicts join a task force known as the \"Suicide Squad\" in exchange for lighter sentences. They are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese to destroy all traces of the giant alien starfish Starro the Conqueror before it falls into the local government's control.\n\nWarner Bros. originally hired Gavin O'Connor to direct. However, O'Connor left due to creative differences, and <Director>Gunn</Director> was hired to write and direct the film after being temporarily fired by Disney and Marvel Studios as director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). He drew inspiration from war films and John Ostrander's 1980s Suicide Squad comics. Filming took place from September 2019 to February 2020, primarily in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as in Colón, Panama, and Porto, Portugal. The film had the biggest sets ever built for a Warner Bros. production.\n\nThe Suicide Squad premiered theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 30, 2021. It was released in the United States on August 5, simultaneously in theaters and on the streaming service HBO Max. It underperformed at the box office grossing $169 million worldwide against a production budget of $185 million. The film received positive reviews from critics unlike its predecessor and became the most-streamed DCEU film on HBO Max. The film's box office performance was attributed to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the film's availability on HBO Max, and its relationship to the first Suicide Squad.\n\nPeacemaker, a spin-off television series starring Cena, debuted on HBO Max in January 2022, and Waller, another television series starring Viola Davis, is in development for Max.\n\n## Plot\n\nIntelligence officer Amanda Waller assembles two Task Force X teams, colloquially known as the \"Suicide Squad\", which consists of Belle Reve penitentiary inmates who agree to carry out missions in exchange for commuted sentences. The teams are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese after an anti-American regime overthrows its government, and are tasked with destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim, which houses the secret experiment \"Project Starfish\".\n\nUpon making landfall, the Corto Maltese military slaughters most of the first team and captures Harley Quinn while team leader Rick Flag escapes. Elsewhere, the second team - led by assassin Bloodsport, who Waller blackmailed in exchange for not sending his estranged daughter Tyla to prison, and consisting of Peacemaker, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, Ratcatcher 2, and her pet rat Sebastian - enters the country undetected. Waller orders the squad to find Flag, who is being held at a rebel base. The team massacres the rebel soldiers, only to learn that rebellion leader Sol Soria had saved Flag. Despite the group's actions, Soria agrees to help them infiltrate the capital, where they capture Project Starfish's lead scientist, the Thinker. Harley is taken to Corto Maltese's new dictator, Silvio Luna, who wishes to marry her. After learning of Luna's plans to use Project Starfish on political dissidents, Harley kills him and escapes. She joins the others, who use the Thinker to break into Jötunheim and begin rigging it with explosives.\n\nFlag and Ratcatcher 2 enter the Thinker's laboratory and find Starro the Conqueror, a giant starfish–like alien that creates smaller versions of itself to kill people and control their bodies. The Thinker explains that Starro was brought to Earth by the U.S. government, which has secretly funded the experiments for decades using Corto Maltesean citizens as test subjects. An enraged Flag decides to leak a hard drive containing evidence of this, but is killed by Peacemaker, who is under orders from Waller to cover up the U.S.'s involvement. Meanwhile, a skirmish between the rest of the team and the military leads to Polka-Dot Man accidentally setting off the explosives prematurely. As Jötunheim crumbles, the drive falls into Ratcatcher 2's possession. Peacemaker attempts to kill her before she can escape with it, but Bloodsport shoots him and takes it.\n\nStarro escapes the destroyed Jötunheim, kills the Thinker and much of the military, and begins taking control of the island's population. Waller tells the squad that their mission is complete and orders them to leave, but Bloodsport leads the team in fighting Starro. Waller attempts to execute them for this, but her subordinates knock her out. After Starro kills Polka-Dot Man, Harley pierces a hole in its eye, allowing Ratcatcher 2 to summon the city's rats to chew Starro to death from the inside. With the military diverted, Soria takes control of the government, promising democratic elections. Bloodsport blackmails Waller into releasing him and the surviving squad members and dropping Tyla's charges in exchange for keeping the contents of the drive confidential. Waller reluctantly agrees and the remaining squad members are airlifted out of Corto Maltese.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, it is revealed that Weasel, a member of the first team, has survived and runs off into the jungle. In a post-credits scene, Waller punishes her subordinates by assigning them to a new mission with Peacemaker, who is still alive and recovering in a hospital.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes.",

The film was co-produced and directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Cline and Zak Penn, and stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. The film is set in 2045, where much of humanity uses the OASIS, a virtual reality simulation, to escape the real world. A teenage orphan finds clues to a contest that promises ownership of the OASIS to the winner, and he and his allies try to complete it before an evil corporation can do so.\n\nDevelopment of the film first began in 2010 when Warner Bros. acquired the rights to the book. In July 2015, Spielberg signed on to direct and produce the film, with casting commencing in September 2015. Filming began in England in June 2016 and was completed in September that year. The visual effects were handled by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Digital Domain and Territory Studio, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor, Inc.. As with the novel, many popular culture references appear throughout the film, including those to the Back to the Future franchise, The Iron Giant, The Shining and the Godzilla franchise.\n\nReady Player One premiered at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 29, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Spielberg's direction, the visual effects, brisk pacing, and the performances of both Sheridan and Rylance.[9][10] It was also a commercial success, grossing around $607 million worldwide against a $155–175 million budget, and earned a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and 72nd British Academy Film Awards. Ready Player One was awarded the title of Best Science Fiction Film at the 45th Saturn Awards, and a further two Outstanding Achievement Awards from the Visual Effects Society. A sequel is in development.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2045, people seek to escape from reality through the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), a virtual reality entertainment universe created by James Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games. After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a contest, granting ownership of the OASIS to the first to find the golden Easter egg within it, which is, however, locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges. The contest has lured several \"Gunters\", or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control the OASIS himself by inserting intrusive online advertising. IOI uses an army of indentured servants and employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.\n\nTeenage orphan Wade Watts' avatar Parzival, an avid Gunter, participates in the first challenge, an unbeatable race, along with his best friend Aech, and Art3mis, a female avatar on whom Parzival has a crush. Parzival regularly visits Halliday's Journals, a simulated archive of Halliday's life and hobbies run by the Curator. Wade receives the Copper Key from Anorak after he wins by driving backward, while Art3mis, Aech, and his friends Daito and Sho, all win the race afterward, later being collectively named the High Five on the OASIS' scoreboard.\n\nSorrento asks mercenary i-R0k to learn Wade's true identity, intending to bribe him to win the contest on IOI's behalf. Wade and Art3mis discover from the Journals that Halliday once dated Morrow's wife Karen \"Kira\" Underwood. Wade and Art3mis visit the Distracted Globe night club to look for clues, where Wade confesses his love and true name to Art3mis. They survive an IOI raid in which Art3mis abandons Wade, explaining that her father died in debt to IOI. i-R0k, who was eavesdropping on their conversation, informs Sorrento of his findings. Sorrento contacts Wade with his offer. When rejected, Sorrento bombs Wade's home, killing his aunt Alice and her boyfriend Rick among others.\n\nArt3mis' player Samantha Cook takes Wade in. Together, they realize the second challenge relates to Halliday's regret of not pursuing a relationship with Kira. Along with Aech, Daito, and Sho, Parzival and Art3mis search for the recreation of the Overlook Hotel. Art3mis asks Kira to dance and wins the Jade Key. Sorrento's subordinate F'Nale Zandor storms the Gunters' hideout and captures Samantha to pay off her father's debt. Wade escapes with the help of the other High-5 users, Helen Harris (Aech), Toshiro (Daito), and Zhou (Sho) in Helen's truck. Samantha escapes confinement after Aech and Parzival hack Sorrento's OASIS rig with Aech recording his confession of the bombing.\n\nThe third challenge is found in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom, where players must guess Halliday's favorite Atari 2600 game to earn the Crystal Key. i-R0k places a forcefield around the castle using the Orb of Osuvox, but Art3mis soon disables it. The High Five lead an army of OASIS players against IOI's forces. Parzival kills Samantha's avatar, allowing her to flee IOI with the High Five picking her up nearby. Parzival and Sorrento fight in the OASIS with Sorrento detonating the Cataclyst bomb, wiping out every avatar on Planet Doom, including himself.\n\nParzival respawns using an extra life coin given to him earlier by the Curator in a bet. He plays Adventure, winning the Crystal Key by locating Warren Robinett's Easter egg. He uses the three keys to enter a treasure room where Anorak offers him a contract to sign. However, he refuses to sign it, recognizing it as the one Morrow signed when Halliday forced him out of Gregarious. Anorak transforms into Halliday who expresses his regrets in life and awards Parzival the Easter egg.\n\nSorrento and F'Nale are arrested for the bombing as Morrow appears, revealing himself as the Curator. Wade decides to run the OASIS with the High Five, inviting Morrow to join them as a consultant. As the IOI Loyalty Centers are shut down, the High Five make the controversial choice to close the OASIS every Tuesday and Thursday for people to spend more time in the real world, including Wade and Samantha, who start a relationship and move into an apartment.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Tye Sheridan as Wade Watts / Parzival,[11] a Gunter who wishes to win the egg hunt so he can leave the stacks.\n- Olivia Cooke as Samantha Cook / Art3mis,[12] a well-known Gunter who works with various allies to ensure the OASIS is kept free and out of the hands of IOI, both inside the game and in real life.

From third of left: Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, T.J. Miller, and Ben Mendelsohn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWarner Bros. bought the film rights for producers Dan Farah and Donald De Line in June 2010, one year before the book was published.[27] Ernest Cline was set to write the script for the film, which De Line and Farah would produce.[28] Eric Eason rewrote Cline's script,[29] and Zak Penn was hired to rewrite the previous drafts by Cline and Eason (who became uncredited for the final draft), along with Village Roadshow Pictures coming aboard.[30] Warner Bros. attempted to convince Christopher Nolan to direct the film as his next project after Interstellar (2014), but he declined.[31] Afterwards the studio made a shortlist of potential directors including Robert Zemeckis, Edgar Wright, Matthew Vaughn, and Peter Jackson.[32][33] A directorial offer was also sent to Josh Trank, who turned it down twice.[34] Steven Spielberg finally signed on to direct and produce the film, which Kristie Macosko Krieger also produced, along with De Line and Farah.[35] Cline and Penn made several revisions while adapting the novel to film. Most of these changes were to eliminate scenes that would be uninteresting in a visual format, such as when Wade beats a high score in Pac-Man, or recites all the lines from the film WarGames.[36][37] In 2016, American musician Moby said he had tried to make the book into a movie, but discovered that Spielberg had taken the role before him.[38]\n\nElle Fanning, Olivia Cooke, and Lola Kirke were the frontrunners for the role of Art3mis;[39] with Cooke announced as having been cast in the role by September 2015.[12] In January 2016, Ben Mendelsohn joined the cast.[13] In February 2016, Tye Sheridan was confirmed to play Wade, after a lengthy casting search for the role.[40] Barry Keoghan screen-tested for the part.[41] Simon Pegg was added to the cast in March,[16] with Mark Rylance joining in April.[17] By June, T.J. Miller, Hannah John-Kamen, and Win Morisaki had also been cast in the film.[15][19][20] In July, Philip Zhao joined the cast,[18] with Lena Waithe, Ralph Ineson, Mckenna Grace, and Letitia Wright being revealed as appearing in the film over time prior to the film's release.[14][22][24][25]\n\nIn October 2019, Doctor Sleep director Mike Flanagan revealed that Jack Nicholson, who portrayed Jack Torrance in The Shining, was approached to appear in the film, but declined the offer due to his retirement.[42]\n\n### Filming\n\nProduction was slated to begin in July 2016,[43] but on July 1, 2016, screenwriter Zak Penn confirmed that the first week of filming had already been completed, meaning that filming began on June 24, 2016.[44] In August and September 2016, filming took place in Birmingham, England, standing in for Columbus, Ohio.[45] Birmingham filming included on Livery Street in the Jewellery Quarter area of the city, which was used for multiple scenes in the film. Ludgate Hill Car Park on Lionel Street, in which caravan homes were partially built, was also used, and a planned explosion there caused some local businesses and residents to call emergency services as no prior notice was given by the production team. Other locations in the city included the former industrial area of Digbeth, and some of the city's landmarks were erased and replaced with CGI buildings to create a dystopian future Ohio.[46][47] Outside of Birmingham, filming also took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and at Solaris House, the former Sun Microsystems headquarters in Surrey.[45][48] Principal photography wrapped on September 27, 2016.[49][50]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nIndustrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Digital Domain, and Territory Studio developed the visual effects, with some pre-visualization work done by The Third Floor.[51][52] For three hours three days a week, Spielberg met with ILM, which was in charge of the OASIS segments and produced the bulk of the visual effects shots, with 900 in total; Spielberg remarked that \"this is the most difficult movie I've done since Saving Private Ryan\", as three 3-hour long meetings a week were necessitated to discuss the visual effects.[50] Visual effects supervisor Roger Guyett stated that the VFX team would collaborate with Spielberg and writers Cline and Penn:[53]\n\nWhat we did at one point was to have a card for every single character that we considered to be a \"hero\" character within the movie, and we put them up on a board and Steven and everyone else spent hours assigning them to scenes. We'd say, \"This is where we want whoever it would be … Batman, Chun-Li, or whoever.\" And then we went through the whole movie doing that. As the scenes developed, we got an understanding of how many characters we needed.\n\nPart of the film takes place in a virtual space based on the Overlook hotel in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film The Shining. It was mostly a digital recreation using high-quality telecine of the original film, allowing new camera angles and shots that did not appear in the original. Some original footage from The Shining was also used, with ILM's modifications. Only a few scenes involved real actors (such as the appearance of the Grady twins) and required reproduction of The Shining's physical sets. The Shining sequence was post-processed with film grain and other aging effects to make the new footage closely resemble the original.[54] The VFX team built the Overlook Hotel sequence in the digital realm, consulting Kubrick's blueprints.[55]\n\nILM also produced digital versions of Ready Player One's many cultural references, including the DeLorean time machine from the Back to the Future films; the Iron Giant; Chucky; and King Kong, modeled after the 1933 film version.[56] The Tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park was created from the base model ILM had created.[56] Digital Domain facilitated pre-visualization (with The Third Floor), motion capture, and virtual sets, and also created 300 visual effects shots for the primarily live-action portions of the film. The virtual sets were powered by game engines and were used congruently with the motion-capture process, with previsualization supervisor Scott Meadows explaining that in real time Spielberg would \"put on a headset and scout the sets and make adjustments.\"[51][52]\n\n## Music\n\nOn June 9, 2016, John Williams was initially going to compose the film's score.[57] However, in July 2017, Williams left the project in favor of scoring Spielberg's The Post, and Alan Silvestri took over scoring duties.[58] The score was released by WaterTower Music as a two-CD set on March 30, 2018,[59] with vinyl and cassette releases projected.[60] At Spielberg's request, Silvestri references his own music from Back to the Future within the film's score, as well as quoting music by other composers, including Max Steiner's theme from King Kong, Akira Ifukube’s main theme from Godzilla, and the score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind from The Shining.[61][62]\n\n## Cultural references\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg was reluctant to include references to his own movies for the film, but would eventually include references to the Back to the Future and Jurassic Park franchises.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReady Player One pays homage to popular culture from various time periods, mainly the 1970s and 1980s but also extending to the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s; reviewers have identified over a hundred references to films, television shows, music, toys, video games, anime, and comics from these eras.[63][64][65] Cline did not have any issues with these copyrighted elements when he published the book, but was aware that securing all necessary rights would be a major obstacle for a film adaptation. This task was eventually made easier thanks to Spielberg's reputation in the film industry.[36][66][67] In the end, Spielberg estimated that they managed to get about 80% of the copyrighted elements they desired.[36] Somewhat ironically, the production was unable to secure the rights to Spielberg's own Close Encounters of the Third Kind from Columbia Pictures.[68]\n\nThe Dungeons &amp; Dragons module Tomb of Horrors features in an important episode of the book, the \"Copper Key challenge\", but that reference was excluded from the film, where the challenge features a huge car race in New York instead. However, the film does reference the module: artwork of the Tomb of Horrors demon appears on the back of Aech's van.[69]\n\nSimilarly Blade Runner, which was integral to the plot of the book, was shelved as Blade Runner 2049 was in production at the same time as Ready Player One and the producers at Alcon Entertainment feared that Spielberg's film could damage the commercial prospects of their film; as a replacement, the creative team had the players play through the events of The Shining, to which Spielberg was able to secure the rights, as an homage to his friend Stanley Kubrick.[36] Penn and Cline also thought that the film could be the opportunity to replace such a lengthy sequence with a more action-heavy one. Once they decided to use The Shining, they were doubtful at first that Spielberg would accept the change, but Spielberg did go for it.[70] While Cline's original work heavily used the character of Ultraman, the rights over the character were still under legal dispute, requiring them to replace him with the titular robot from The Iron Giant and the RX-78-2 Gundam.[71] Spielberg recognized that his past films were a significant part of the 1980s popular culture cited in the book, and to avoid being accused of \"vanity\", he opted to remove many of the references to his own work.[72] Cline stated that he believed Spielberg wanted to avoid self-references to films he directed, due to the criticism he received for his film 1941, which lampooned his own previous works Jaws and Duel. Cline said he had to convince Spielberg to include some iconic elements, such as the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future, which Spielberg conceded as the film was one he produced rather than directed.[73] Spielberg also allowed the Tyrannosaurus rex from his own Jurassic Park to be included.[56] Cline also asked ILM to include a reference to Last Action Hero, one of Penn's first screenplays, without Penn's knowledge; a movie marquee in the Manhattan race segment bears the name \"Jack Slater\", the character Arnold Schwarzenegger played in that film.[74]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nReady Player One was originally scheduled to be released on December 15, 2017.[75] However, on February 9, 2016, it was delayed to March 30, 2018, to avoid competition with Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[76] In January 2018, it was announced the film's release date had been moved up one day to March 29.[77] The film had its world premiere at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018 (as part of the South by Southwest Film Festival).[5] Warner Bros. distributed the film worldwide, with Village Roadshow Pictures distributing in several overseas territories.[78] Around the same time, the massively multi-player online game platform Roblox held an event based on it. The winner of the event was the user r0cu.[79]\n\n### Home media\n\nReady Player One was released on digital copy on July 3, 2018, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, and DVD on July 24, 2018.[80] The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart, a tracker of combined domestic Blu-Ray and DVD unit sales, for the week ending on July 27, 2018.[81] It retained the No. 1 spot on the chart for the week ending on August 4, 2018.[82]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nReady Player One grossed $137.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $469.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $607 million.[8] Deadline Hollywood had estimated it would need to gross at least $440 million to break even, given its $175 million budget.[83]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Ready Player One was projected to gross $40–50 million from 4,100 theaters over its first four days.[7] It made $12.1 million on its first day, including $3.75 million from Wednesday night previews. It ended up grossing $41.8 million in its opening weekend (for a four-day total of $53.7 million).[84] It made $24.6 million in its second weekend, finishing second behind newcomer A Quiet Place, and $11.5 million in its third weekend, finishing in fourth.[85][86]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 72% with an average score of 6.8/10, based on 443 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Ready Player One is a sweetly nostalgic thrill ride that neatly encapsulates Spielberg's strengths while adding another solidly engrossing adventure to his filmography.\"[87] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film an 82% overall positive score and a 65% \"definite recommend\".[83]\n\nIn a review for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico wrote that the film's \"overwhelming\" nature and non-stop action will likely thrill fans of pop culture; while he observed narrative weaknesses, such as a lack of depth among the supporting characters, he felt that they ultimately do not hinder the film from working \"on the level of technical, blockbuster mastery that Spielberg helped define\".[89] Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman called the film a \"coruscating explosion of pop-culture eye candy\" and found the sequence based on The Shining to be \"irresistible\". However, he criticized Spielberg's separation of fantasy and reality, and he said the film has \"more activity than it does layers\".[90] IndieWire's Eric Kohn characterized the film as \"an astonishing sci-fi spectacle and a relentless nostalgia trip at once\" and praised both the sequence based on The Shining and Penn's screenplay, particularly with respect to Mendelsohn's character. Nevertheless, he remarked that the film \"drags a bunch in its final third\".[91] Alissa Wilkinson, writing for Vox, praised both the quality and quantity of the worldbuilding. She also commented on just how dystopian the future portrayed is, where the main characters fight to save the OASIS and the escape from reality it represents, with arguably less concern for the problems of the real world.[92] Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Ready Player One and noted the undercurrent of sadness present in the film, stating that \"I don't think Spielberg gets enough credit for making sad films that most people interpret as happy, and complex films that are immediately dismissed as simple or confused\".[93][94][95] Seitz concluded that the film \"is a mess, but it is a fascinating and complex one...\"[96] In March 2019, a year after the film's release, Seitz determined that with Ready Player One's images commenting on capitalism and popular culture, the film was the second-most \"interesting [and] substantive\" big-budgeted fantasy in 2018 after Black Panther, admitting that \"I still think about [Ready Player One] a lot, especially concerning the world around me.\"[97][98]\n\nMonica Castillo was more critical of the film in her review for The Guardian and drew attention to the absence of character arcs, the lack of resolution for plot holes in the novel, and the bloating of scenes in the film by trivia.[99] Alonso Duralde, writing for TheWrap, found the usage of pop culture references lacking, and found his experience watching the film as \"feeling bombarded with images, bored by the lack of an interesting story, and irritated with my own cultural past. I've never been much of a video-game player, but by the finale, I was ready to 'Leeroy Jenkins!' my way out of the theater\".[100]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                         | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                  | Recipient(s)                                                                               | Result    | Ref(s)    |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Sci-Fi Movie                                       | Ready Player One                                                                           | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor                                 | Tye Sheridan                                                                               | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actress                               | Olivia Cooke                                                                               | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Teen Choice Awards            | August 12, 2018     | Choice Breakout Movie Star                                | Olivia Cooke                                                                               | Nominated | [101]     |\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards  | January 13, 2019    | Best Visual Effects                                       | Ready Player One                                                                           | Nominated | [102]     |\n| Visual Effects Society Awards | February 5, 2019    | Outstanding Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature         | Roger Guyett, Jennifer Meislohn, Dave Shirk, Matthew E.

I don't know if Steven [Spielberg] would want to dive back in, because he would know what he is getting into. He's said that it's the third-hardest film he's made, out of dozens and dozens of movies\".[111][112][113] Cline wrote a book sequel, titled Ready Player Two, which was released on November 24, 2020, stating in the acknowledgments that he had consulted Spielberg on the final draft of the book and where to take a potential film adaptation.[114][115]\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Cline announced that a sequel was in the early stages of development.[116] Spielberg confirmed that the film was still in development as of March 2024, stating that he would not direct the film unlike its predecessor, but produce it.[117]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f \"Film Releases\".

After Halliday's death, a pre-recorded message left by his avatar Anorak announces a contest, granting ownership of the OASIS to the first to find the golden Easter egg within it, which is, however, locked behind a gate requiring three keys which players can obtain by accomplishing three challenges. The contest has lured several \"Gunters\", or egg hunters, and the interest of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online Industries (IOI) who seeks to control the OASIS himself by inserting intrusive online advertising. IOI uses an army of indentured servants and employees called \"Sixers\" to find the egg.</PlotComplexity>\n    </Summary>\n    <MainCharacter>\n        <Name>Wade Watts</Name>\n        <HeroArchetype>Parzival</HeroArchetype>\n        <Description>A teenage orphan who participates in the contest to win the OASIS.</Description>\n    </MainCharacter>\n</Plot>\n\n<Cast>\n    <Actor>\n        <Name>Tye Sheridan</Name>\n        <Role>Wade Watts / Parzival</Role>\n    </Actor>\n    <Actor>\n        <Name>Olivia Cooke</Name>\n        <Role>Samantha Cook / Art3mis</Role>\n    </Actor>\n    <Actor>\n        <Name>Ben Mendelsohn</Name>\n        <Role>Nolan Sorrento / IOI-655321</Role>\n    </Actor>\n    <Actor>\n        <Name>Lena Waithe</Name>\n        <Role>Helen Harris / Aech</Role>\n    </Actor>\n    <Actor>\n        <Name>T.J.

It's easy to see how this phrase could be distressingly applied to the Hollywood machine, full of reboots and sequels and bald-faced pastiches. My counter-argument would be that \"nothing new under the sun\" gives creators freedom — if everything's already been done, why not have fun doing it?\n\nThe Mummy, a Stephen Sommers action-adventure-horror blockbuster from 1999, is an obvious melange of influences. Most bluntly, it's a take on Universal Pictures' The Mummy series of films from the 1930s and '40s, and a general update of that studio's classic, Gothic horror films (many of which are adaptations of Gothic horror novels and stories before them). But the charming, fleet, and wholly entertaining picture also blends elements of classic, romance-tinged adventure cinema — Indiana Jones, Romancing the Stone, The African Queen, early film serials — and contemporary, family-tinged action-adventure cinema — Jumanji, Hook, Men in Black, and Jurassic Park. All of this blended together yielded a film that felt timeless yet timely, post-modern yet classical, faithful to adults looking for romance and horror while never alienating kids looking for fun set pieces and silliness. The Mummy's reputation has only increased in the years since release, even culminating in that most honored of contemporary pop culture status: A Super Yaki tribute.\n\nSince that film's release, Hollywood has tried to re-shine the sun on The Mummy and recapture its lightning-in-a-bottle success in varying ways, including two official sequels extending the continuity, a spinoff extending the unvierse, and a 2017 reboot that tried to start its own, new cinematic universe. It's also tried to make new Mummy-esque movies, attempting to blend that film's ingredients of adventure, action, horror, romance, comedy, and classical panache into something new yet old. With Jungle Cruise the latest film attempting to rekindle this highly specific genre, we thought it interesting to examine 12 of the most Mummy-feeling attempts since it changed cinema in 1999.\n\nRELATED: 'The Mummy' Animated Series Exists, But Should It? | Saturday Mourning Cartoons\n\n## The Road to El Dorado\n\nIn many central ways a thorough embodiment of the \"DreamWorks Smirk,\" The Road to El Dorado casts two con artists, Miguel and Tulio (Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline having a ton of fun), on an accidental journey toward the mythical-but-surprisingly-real land of El Dorado, a city of gold and riches. Plus, thanks to some farcical misunderstandings, our wisecracking, eternally smirking leads are viewed by this city's people as gods coming down from the spiritual realm to fulfill prophecies. Hijinks, treasure-seeking, lesson-learning, and an oft-problematic relationship between \"colonizers\" and \"colonized\" ensues; sometimes the film wants to satirize the idea that these simple villagers could be bamboozled so easily, sometimes it wants to play that regressive trope straight (this winds up being a pervasive problem in many of these kinds of films).\n\nAnd speaking of problematic: The jocular tone of the picture, especially when oriented around our bumbling, maverick heroes and their continuum of \"greed vs. altruism,\" often plays to its benefit, giving the Mummy adjacent adventure picture a welcome sense of lightness and spontaneity (at one point Miguel literally stifles laughter, which feels like a very real reaction from Branagh in the booth that was animated in) even as its narrative gets curiously stuck in the middle section. But the budding \"enemies-turned-to-reluctant-allies-turned-to-lovers\" romantic arc feels garish in its explicit male gaze. Rosie Perez plays Chel, the Mesoamerican object of our heroes' affections, and she is animated with a gaudy, audacious sexualization. Chel proves herself to be a capable, crafty figure — she's immediately onto the con artists' plan and wants in — but the top-down choices about her, from the way she moves to the way she's lusted after, reveal a shallow, icky viewpoint of women from many key creative members. While it's admittedly nice to see her and one of our heroes wind up together in a semi-organic matter, this romance is a far cry from the sparkling, equal-footing relationship between Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), our heroes from The Mummy.\n\nFinally, I'm just gonna say it: \"Forever May Not Be Long Enough\" from The Mummy Returns is better than any of the phoned-in-feeling Elton John and Tim Rice El Dorado tunes.\n\n## The Mummy Returns\n\nImage via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpeaking of The Mummy Returns and He Brought a Dope Nu-Metal Tune With Him: This 2001 sequel brings back just about every member of the key creative players, including Sommers, Fraser, and Weisz, for an even bigger, more globe-trotting feeling adventure that scratches just about every itch you had lingering from the first one. Rick and Evelyn now have a child named Alex (Freddie Boath), who shares his mother's precociousness and his father's stubbornness, and gives the younger audience a more explicit avatar to latch onto (your mileage may vary, but I find him to be quite the endearing, and not annoying, young hero, especially in his interplay with John Hannah as his uncle and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the henchman assigned to watch him). Evelyn has a richer interior journey to go on, involving a prophecy of reincarnation and/or lineage that gives Weisz lots of dope, physical action to do (especially a kinetically staged flashback fight scene between her and Patricia Velásquez). And the film's front half broadens the scope of the action away from Egypt, including a crackling banter-filled fight scene in the O'Connell's home and a thrilling London double-decker bus chase involving a bunch of skeletal mummies. The Mummy Returns, by design, feels less tightly constructed and surprising than the first film, but for a round two of crowd-pleasing fun with characters you love, it's hard to beat.\n\n## The Scorpion King\n\nImage via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Mummy Returns featured the introduction of Dwayne Johnson as Mathayus, the Scorpion King, who enters a vicious deal with Anubis for power in exchange for eternal damnation. This gave the picture higher physical stakes in the climactic battle — stakes with pretty rough CGI, but still — and opened the backdoor for the MCU. That is to say, the Mummy Cinematic Universe.\n\nThe Scorpion King, released one year after The Mummy Returns, puts Johnson on a solo, originating adventure as our titular king. And while the spinoff was at least lucrative enough to kickstart a direct-to-video sub-franchise, it was critically drubbed, and basically slammed the door on any future Sommers-authored Mummy-verses (Sommers is credited as a writer and producer on this one).\n\nIt's a pity, that, because on modern watch, The Scorpion King is a refreshingly old-school bout of action-adventure, a sturdy piece of craft that delivers thrills from a character-driven place, and a welcomely self-contained story of human decisions affecting each other; from a nuts-and-bolts perspective, it might even play tighter than the bigger-scaled Mummy Returns. With Sommers not in the director's chair, Chuck Russell (Eraser) helms this one, replacing the original Mummy's sense of timeless classicism with muscly machismo, one-liners, ostentatious camerawork, and a crunchy-guitar flavored score. Johnson, therefore, has to make up with the \"dated on arrival\" pulp by committing hard with and against the picture's current of cheese, centering it with a welcome balance of stoicism and fun. Most welcomely, the film's female lead, played well by Kelly Hu, asserts herself as an intriguing sorcerer, a sensible and sparks-inducing romantic partner for Johnson, and a thrilling foil against our primary villain, played subtly by Steven Brand. These two characters motivate each other's arcs in satisfying ways that come close to replicating the magic of the first Mummy, while the rest of the film's thrills feel like The Mummy on Mountain Dew. And that ain't a bad thing.\n\n## Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\n\nImage via Disney\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an adaptation of a separate, pre-existing piece of intellectual property, that property happens to be a theme park ride. There are a ton of vibes in that theme park ride, vibes that director Gore Verbinski translates very well. But not a ton of story or narrative to mine from. So where do you go?\n\nObviously, the 2003 swashbuckler looks at the genre of pirate storytelling and folklore as a primary source of influence, while also cribbing from classic swords-and-scoundrels films like The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Mark of Zorro, and The Princess Bride. But in its imaginatively gruesome but family-friendly fusion of decomposing body horror, its budding-but-reluctant romance between Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, and its modernized takes on set pieces and comedic tones, Black Pearl feels an awful lot like a voyage in the wake of The Mummy. However — and this is particularly strange given the Disney of it all — Black Pearl feels looser, weirder, and wilder than The Mummy while still retaining that film's whip-smart sense of pacing and stakes. The Mummy is a playful movie, to be sure, but its playfulness feels embedded within the confines of its genre; Fraser, Weisz, and Hannah's use of comic relief don't poke at the edges of the frame so much as pleasurably represent the best of the frame. Black Pearl, most efficiently encapsulated by Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, feels in its self-aware sense of humor like all of the comedy types and tropes represented in The Mummy smooshed together alongside the grotesqueries of the CGI villains, and sprinkled with a chaotic dash of Bill Murray, Monty Python, Beetlejuice, and the surrealist art movement. It plays like someone watched The Mummy and thought, \"I can take the piss out of that,\" but couldn't help use the bones of a competent adventure film to make their points pop even more aggressively (the sequels forget this \"competent adventure film\" skeleton and lean hard into the chaotic surrealism of it all, to their detriment).\n\n## Van Helsing\n\nImage via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector Stephen Sommers found two massive back-to-back successes by updating a Universal monster movie with sweeping adventure, grand scale, and a sizzling enemies-to-lovers romance at its center. Naturally, his next move would be to do exactly that again but with all the Universal monsters at the same time. The result was Van Helsing, and it is a monster-sized turd next to The Mummy, but man, it is trying. Everything about Van Helsing is trying its absolute hardest, and that starts at the top with Hugh Jackman as the titular vampire hunter, who is ordered by the Vatican to destroy the biggest bloodsucker of them all, Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh, also dialed up to 12). Jackman, as usual, throws every ounce of his jacked theater kid energy into this film, and it’s incredibly endearing even if it doesn’t quite work, despite all the Mummy blueprint pieces being in place. You’ve got David Wenham as Van Helsing’s assistant, a sort of hybrid Jonathan/Beni hybrid comic relief. The script from Sommers himself aims to turn the simple monster lore into a heightened melodrama wherein a vampire can only be killed by a werewolf but also Frankenstein’s monster (Shuler Hensley, dialed to around 15) is a vital part of the process. And then there’s the simmering will-they/won’t-they between Jackman and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious, last descendant of a family sworn to kill Dracula. The chemistry there couldn’t dream of touching Rick O’Connell and Evelyn Carnahan but, at one point, Van Helsing and Anna do dramatically swing over a masquerade ball full of vampires, and if there isn’t a hint of The Mummy in that series of words, there isn’t a hint of The Mummy anywhere. -Vinnie Mancuso\n\n## National Treasure\n\nImage via Buena Vista Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Mummy and National Treasure are both fantastic adventure films born from an idea that shouldn’t have worked at all. Much like nobody was clambering for a big-budget, achingly horny update of a 1932 Boris Karloff monster movie, not many people thought the next great adventure film should center around... Nicolas Cage. But both films speak to the power of unorthodox casting and confidence in your pitch. Much like the way the success of the Mummy’s aesthetic radiates outward from its central duo, National Treasure works because of Nicolas Cage and his oddball energy. A standard straight-faced action hero delivering the line “I’m going to steal the Declaration of Independence” would unravel the movie; here, you buy into the tongue-in-cheek energy of it all, that same exact wink that made The Mummy, Romancing the Stone, and Raiders of the Lost Ark work before it.\n\nIt’s worth noting that The Mummy and National Treasure also produced sequels of the “kind of different, but mostly the same!” variety that are both actually pretty dang fun, but also highlight the absolute lightning-in-a-bottle miracle quality of the first films (Meanwhile, National Treasure 3 has been a question mark for years now, and we do not speak of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor). -Vinnie Mancuso\n\n## The Librarian: Quest for the Spear\n\nImage via TNT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2004, writer David Titcher, director Peter Winther, and star Noah Wyle tried something audacious: To make a big-budget, treasure-hunting adventure film within the low-budget basic cable dredges of TNT. Thus, The Librarian: Quest for the Spear was born — and on contemporary viewing, if you put yourself in the right mindset, you will have a lot of fun with this curious little picture.\n\nFirst, perhaps obviously, the gripping sheen of the big-budget Mummy visual effects simply cannot be replicated on this film's budget, resulting in some garish compositing, questionably quick \"hide the seams\" edits, and downright laughable attempts at action set pieces. The film also has some issues with tone; while The Mummy blends together its straighter action-adventure impulses with its sillier comedic attitudes with immersion and totality, The Librarian lurches back and forth between tones based on nothing other than the whim of the scene. Olympia Dukakis plays it like a broad comedy, Kyle MacLachlan plays it like an operatic thriller, and Wyle plays it differently from scene to scene, moment to moment, jaggedly articulating broad comedy right before romantic heroism, finding pockets of success before getting bored and wearing a new pair of pants.\n\nHowever, Quest for the Spear is sneakily one of the more progressive flicks on this list, especially in its study of gender roles. The trope for these kinds of movies, a trope The Mummy is more than willing to play hard into, is to position its male lead as a bumbling-but-charming shoot first ask questions later type, and its female lead as a severe-but-repressed book smart type. Both parties have to learn the strengths of each other's ways while bickering — and falling in love — the whole time. Here, these roles are simply, cleanly, and neatly flipped. Wyle, our titular Librarian, has gotten over 20 college degrees without an ounce of real-world experience; he's about as pure an example of the book smart adventure hero as you'll ever see. But Sonya Walger, our female lead, grabs the picture with confident action heroism, readily admitting that she may not possess any of Wyle's arcane knowledge, but she does have strength and physical acumen to spare (as she phrases it literally to Wyle, \"Me brawn, you brain\"). In this simple gender reversal, Quest for the Spear finds tons of refreshing fun and intrigue, and gives the romance between the two a new kind of spark that plays with genuine affection and cleverness. Movies can get away with spectacle over character; on TV, when budgetary limitations can only give you so much spectacle, your characters need to work. Here, we see that idea taken to its limits, and we have some honest-to-goodness fun along the way (and if you dig Quest for the Spear, there are two other Librarian movies to check out, followed by a four-season TV spinoff).\n\n## Sahara\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBroadly speaking, the mid-2000s brought a lot of performative darkness and edginess into mainstream cinema. Emboldened and disillusioned by 9/11, a virulently criticized president, and an unprecedently media-saturated war, we watched comedies shift into male sex fantasies developed for the \"unrated DVD\" market, horrors shift into \"torture porn,\" and actioners shift into morally cloudy tone poems of sadness.\n\nIn 2005, we watched Breck Eisner try to fuse this particular brand of millennium-era existentialism into the light frothiness of a Mummy-styled adventure. It was, in short, a failure. Sahara is confusing, a nightmare of tonal extremes, a series of whiff after whiff without any sense of cause and effect. Penélope Cruz stars as a World Health Organization doctor investigating a deadly disease spreading across Mali amidst the backdrop of a vicious dictator attempting to ethnically cleanse his people, and a group of rich, white imperialists trying to maintain their financial interests while turning a blind eye to the horrors around them.\n\nAnd then, in the middle of all this: Matthew McConaughey is a rascally treasure-hunter! Steve Zahn and Rainn Wilson are his goofy, wisecracking cohorts! McConaughey regularly diffuses any inherent tension with one-liners, eyebrow waggles, and nonsensical banter with Zahn! And when the film tries to fuse these two threads together, it really, really does not work! Sahara is a jagged little pill of a film, all corners and disparities that bleed tastelessness. The Mummy may be a blend of influences including the cinema of its time, but Sahara goes to show how impressive a juggling act that level of seamless pastiche can be (by, just to be clear, dropping every single one of its balls, and one of its balls is a chainsaw on fire).\n\n## Stardust\n\nImage via Paramount Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA bit more traditionally fairytale-esque in its approach to fantasy-adventure, Stardust is still one of the most swashbuckling, romantic, and all-around best spiritual successors to The Mummy you’ll find. Directed by Matthew Vaughn and adapted from the novella by Neil Gaiman, the 2007 film stars Daredevil's Charlie Cox as Tristan Thorn, a young man from a small English village who makes his way into a fantastical kingdom just beyond the town limits and falls for a walking, talking fallen star (Claire Danes).\n\nBeyond sharing genres, there are a lot of structural similarities between Stardust and The Mummy; the antagonistic-turned-true-love dynamic, vengeful spirits of the royally betrayed, and the relentless pursuit of a monster in need of a sacrifice. In Stardust, it's a trio of witches seeking eternal youth who feed on the hearts of fallen stars to stay forever young, led by screen icon Michelle Pfieffer, who relishes in her wicked role with the satisfied energy of a pedigree cat lapping at pure cream. Stardust also has a key selling point that The Mummy doesn't - Robert DeNiro as a sky pirate. Obviously, immediately, a must-watch. - Haleigh Foutch\n\n## The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\n\nImage via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEarlier, you will have noticed my colleague Vinnie Mancuso say \"we do not speak of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.\" I had never seen it. Now I have. Vinnie was right to warn us.\n\nThe Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor does not feature Weisz reprising her role as Evelyn. She left the project in pre-production due to dissatisfaction with the script. Weisz tried to warn us, and we were wrong to ignore her.\n\nMaria Bello takes over Evelyn for this threequel, unfortunately muting Weisz's sparkly, irascible take on the character for a classier, more interior, and less wholly charismatic read on the part. Fraser's reprisal of Rick feels Flanderized; he's broadened Rick out into a live-action cartoon character, seemingly ignoring what change and nuance he's gone through the two previous films in favor of an easy, mugging joke or energetic action movement (though in his defense, Fraser also sells some of the sweatiest moments of \"emotional connection\" with surprisingly subtle work). Stephen Sommers is out as director, instead producing the work of original The Fast and the Furious director Rob Cohen. Under Cohen's eye, The Mummy franchise becomes a cruder beast, a work less concerned with mining the classical pleasures of cinema's greatest adventures than with trying to attract \"today's teenagers\" with a harder, blunter visual style and a downright yucky, puerile obsession with sex (watching Bello ask winkingly, even flirtatiously about her teenage son Luke Ford's sex life is upsetting on many levels).\n\nThe Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is franchise betrayal — with one exception. The tale of ancient mythology, horror imagery, and big-bad inspiration concerns Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, obvious pros, and watching their storyline rendered with emotional commitment and crafty martial arts action provides an oasis among the rest of the film's desert.\n\n## The Mummy (2017)\n\nImage via Universal Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTom Cruise’s attempt to sprint awkwardly into a cinematic universe populated by Universal’s classic monsters was violently rejected by the general public like a belly full of discontinued ice cream from Friendly’s. In addition to the obvious flaw of zero Brendan Frasers in the cast, 2017’s The Mummy is so bogged down with putting all the right pieces into play to set up the infamous Dark Universe that it forgets to do its job as an adventure film. All those thrilling sequences from the 1999 mega-hit are replaced by blandly desaturated stretches of droning expository dialogue, most of which is delivered by a hulking Russell Crowe, who plays Dr. Henry Jekyll because this movie is stupid. It’s relentlessly dull and almost aggressively charmless, but worst of all, it just isn’t any fun. If you showed a director Stephen Sommers’ The Mummy and told them to craft that movie’s mortal enemy, Alex Kurtzman’s dismal 2017 reboot is the film they would create every time. - Tom Reimann\n\n## Jungle Cruise\n\nImage via Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen I saw the first trailer for Jungle Cruise, I immediately thought to myself, \"This film is trying to be 1999's The Mummy.\" Granted, its status as a Disney theme park adaptation and usage of CGI-assisted body horror scoundrels maybe means it's more explicitly trying to be Pirates of the Caribbean. But after viewing the agreeably entertaining film, I have never been more convinced that there is nothing new under the sun; Jungle Cruise is absolutely a take on Pirates of the Caribbean while also being a take on The Mummy while also being a take on every other postmodern-cum-classical adventure film featured on this list. At times the picture plays too tightly, too sure of these tropes it's plundering as a style; like if someone turned The Mummy into a Disneyland ride. However, Jungle Cruise makes some wild swings throughout that ensure it strikes its own, decidedly bonkers voice.\n\nEmily Blunt's character introduction to Jungle Cruise is an explicit bite and heighten of Rachel Weisz's Mummy introduction. Like Weisz before her, Blunt is seen climbing a ladder of a World War I-era bookshelf; but where Weisz's bookshelf shenanigans lead to accidental slapstick mayhem, Blunt's bookshelf shenanigans are as a purposeful author of intentional action mayhem. Dwayne Johnson shares the slick, con artist charms of Fraser's Mummy character, with an obvious over-emphasis on brawn and an unfortunately muted performance tone that snips some of the joys of both his romantic arc and his corny jokes (to imagine Fraser's take on these Jungle Cruise tour guide jokes, cribbed directly from the ride, is to experience bliss). The CGI body-horror conquistador villains cross the gnarly, viscerally pleasurable vibes of the Pirates' ghost designs with the emotional despair and commitment of The Mummy's Imhotep; Édgar Ramírez takes the tracks left by Arnold Vosloo's tragically rendered monster and plunges even further into hurt and heartbreak, giving a performance that, at times, feels more endearing than our heroes. And Jack Whitehall's take on the \"comic relief brother of the female lead,\" played with such verve in The Mummy by John Hannah, is hilarious, refreshingly without ego, and eventually given room to find a modernized sense of pathos no other adventure film on this list would dare take the time to find.\n\nBeyond the mostly effective modernizations of well-trod tropes in Jungle Cruise, the film fosters its own identity by sheer force of potentially alienating risk. Paul Giamatti's supporting character, a greedy businessman whom Johnson owes a lot of money, is turned into a commedia dell'arte whirlwind, a beyond-over-the-top invention of pure artificiality and stylization with no desire to be restrained by good taste; you can't stop watching or thinking about it. Jesse Plemons' work as our big bad looks at Giamatti's work and says, \"Lemme try and top that.\" He is the idea of \"a stereotypical German villain\" taken to satirical extremes, all hyperbolic bluster and hair-flopping discomfort and capital F Fun. And halfway through the picture, director Jaume Collet-Serra grinds everything to a screeching halt to dive into a lengthy, Metallica-scored flashback that changes the context of one of our main characters dramatically, careening the final act into unexpected territory.\n\nThese wild choices make Jungle Cruise ultimately a less purposefully, wholly satisfying film than The Mummy, but they also give it room to be itself, to makes its own place under the sun. Jungle Cruise, therefore, represents a promising future for this genre of film so effectively encapsulated by The Mummy (1999) after it seemed to be crushed by The Mummy (2017). Where will the Mummy-esque action-adventure-horror-fantasy-romantic-comedy go from here? I can't wait to strap on my leather boots and find out.\n\nKEEP READING: The Horrifying Horniness of Universal's Classic Monsters\n\n- Movie Features\n- Features\n- Movie\n\nRecommended\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The Directors of 'Novocaine's Last Film Boldly Asked “Could We Defeat The Thing By Giving It Anxiety?”\n\nDan Berk and Robert Olsen went on a backpacking trip with Maika Monroe and Jake Lacy for this 2022 sci-fi horror.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Roger Ebert Gave a Rare Perfect Score to the Meg Ryan Film That Features Her Best Performance — And You Can Watch It Now on Hulu\n\nRyan, Andy Garcia, and Philip Seymour Hoffman created something special with 'When a Man Loves a Woman'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Didn't Like The Cosmic Final Boss in the 1990’s 'Stephen King's It'?

Loosely adapted from the 2010 short film Pixels by Patrick Jean (who serves as an executive producer on the film), the film stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad and Brian Cox. The film involves an alien force misinterpreting video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, to which they respond by attacking Earth with technological recreations of icons from the games. The President of the United States assembles a team of former arcade champions to lead the planet's defense.\n\nInspired by Patrick Jean's short film Pixels, Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy developed a script that eventually incorporated Kevin James as the U.S. President. Chris Columbus joined as director in 2013, drawn to the story's nostalgic homage to 1980s arcade games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Space Invaders, which were licensed for the film. Pre-production finalized the casting with a budget of $110 million. Filming took place in Toronto, transformed into New York and Washington, D.C., involving extensive night shoots and practical sets. Post-production, led by Digital Domain and Sony Pictures Imageworks, focused on creating voxelized 3D versions of arcade characters to integrate into live-action scenes. Innovations like CRT-inspired visual effects, voxel-based character modeling, and light-emitting animations brought iconic games to life, with standout sequences such as a Pac-Man chase and Donkey Kong barrel scenes. The visual effects were completed by mid-2015.\n\nColumbia Pictures theatrically released Pixels in the United States on July 24, 2015. It grossed $245 million on an $110 million budget and received negative reviews. It received five nominations at the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture.\n\n## Plot\n\nAt an arcade in 1982, with his friends Will Cooper and Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, 13-year-old Sam Brenner discovers he can master the games by spotting patterns. Participating in a video game championship, he seemingly loses in a Donkey Kong match against obnoxious arcade player Eddie \"The Fireblaster\" Plant. Videocassette footage of the event is included in a time capsule launched into space.\n\nIn the present, Brenner is an electronics installer while Will is the President of the United States. Brenner comforts a divorced Violet van Patten. Meanwhile Andersen Air Force Base in Guam is besieged and left in the form of pixelated debris. Will summons Brenner and lieutenant colonel Violet to the White House.\n\nSeeing video footage of the attack, Brenner notes the attack's resemblance to the starship game Galaga; however, the army leader Porter warns Will of impeachment. Brenner meets with Ludlow, who explains the attack was by aliens who mistook the footage as a declaration of war and challenge Earth to a best-of-five battle, claiming Earth has lost the first match. Brenner and Ludlow tell Will of a coordinated aim at North India, but Will dismisses their concerns, so the aliens attack the Taj Mahal as Arkanoid; Earth loses the second match.\n\nBrenner and Ludlow train Navy SEALs to play the games while Violet develops effective energy weapons. The team heads to London, where the aliens attack Hyde Park as Centipede, but are defeated by Brenner and Ludlow. The aliens send a trophy in the form of the Duck Hunt dog.\n\nThe team celebrates before the aliens remind them that Earth remains 1–2. Will and Ludlow encourage a reluctant Brenner to recruit Eddie, who is freed from prison to assist in NYC, where the team and Tōru Iwatani fight in Mini Coopers as ghosts against a giant Pac-Man.\n\nFranchise creator Iwatani tries to reason with it but Pac-Man bites his hand. Brenner narrowly beats Pac-Man and wins the game with Q*bert as a trophy. Brenner asks Violet on a date. There, the aliens accuse Earth of cheating, meaning Earth fails the challenge.\n\nViolet's son Matty discovers that Eddie used a cheat code written on his glasses, like he did during the 1982 Donkey Kong match. Eddie flees and the aliens abduct Matty; Violet is dismissed from her rank.\n\nThe aliens attack Washington, D.C. with an army of video game characters. The team, along with Will and a repentant Eddie, attempt to stop the aliens with leftover energy weapons. Character Lady Lisa attacks Ludlow, his crush, but he persuades her to join him.\n\nBrenner, Violet, and Will are summoned to the alien mother ship for a last chance to save Earth by facing their leader as Donkey Kong. The trio is placed on the starting level with Donkey Kong and the captives at the top level, in a remake of the 1981 game.\n\nNoticing the random pattern of barrels and fireballs, Brenner loses hope until Matty reveals Eddie's cheating. Realizing he is actually the world's best Donkey Kong player, Brenner regains his spirit and defeats Donkey Kong. The aliens leave Earth.\n\nThe team is hailed as heroes and Will negotiates a peace agreement with the aliens. Eddie apologizes to Brenner for cheating and acknowledges him as the best Donkey Kong player. Ludlow is devastated that Lisa is gone, so Q*Bert transforms its likeness to Lisa. Brenner and Violet start a romantic relationship while Eddie, as he requested, meets Serena Williams and Martha Stewart in the Lincoln Bedroom. The aliens restore everything on Earth, including Iwatani's hand. A year later, the married Ludlow and Lisa have Q*bert-like children.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n( to )  (pictured in 2014),  (2011), and  (2015)\n\n- Adam Sandler as Sam Brenner, a former arcade video game champion, Cooper's childhood friend and the leader of the Arcaders.\n    - Anthony Ippolito as the young Brenner.\n- Kevin James as Will \"Chewie \" Cooper, the disgraced President of the United States , Brenner's childhood friend and a member of the Arcaders.\n    - Jared Riley as the young Cooper.\n- Michelle Monaghan as Lieutenant Colonel Violet van Patten, a unique weapons developer and specialist for the military and a member of the Arcaders.\n- Peter Dinklage as Eddie \"The Fireblaster\" Plant, Brenner's former rival and a member of the Arcaders.

Eventually, Herlihy and Sandler came up with the concept of having Kevin James be the President of the United States and rewrote the film incorporating this element.[13] In July 2012, Tim Dowling was hired to rewrite the film. Seth Gordon was attached as executive producer and as a possible candidate to direct the film.[14] Chris Columbus became involved in the project in May 2013.[15] Columbus said he first met Sandler to discuss a possible remake of Hello Ghost, and as he left the meeting, Columbus was handed a script for Pixels. The script affected Columbus, who considered it \"one of the most original ideas I had seen since the Amblin days\" and a good opportunity to harken back to the 1980s comedies he worked on.[16] Characters from classic arcade games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Frogger, Galaga and Donkey Kong, among several others, were licensed for use from companies such as Atari, Taito, Konami, Bandai Namco Games and Nintendo. Q*bert was coincidentally already owned by Sony Pictures, as Columbia Pictures owned Gottlieb while they developed the original game.[17]\n\nThere were originally plans to include a scene where the Great Wall of China is attacked, but the concept was removed from the script in hopes of improving the film's chances in the Chinese market.[18] Nintendo allowed the use of Mario in the film, with his Donkey Kong incarnation appearing as a cameo, though his Super Mario Bros. incarnation was to appear in a cut post-credits scene, where an alien resembling him is seen surviving at the Washington Monument. Columbus noted that they could not make the scene work and decided against producing the scene.[19]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nOn February 26, 2014, it was announced that Sandler would play the lead role in the film, while James and Josh Gad were in early talks to join the cast.[20] On March 28, Peter Dinklage was also in final talks to join the film, playing the fourth and final male lead.[21] Jennifer Aniston was originally considered for the female lead, but declined due to scheduling conflicts.[22] On April 4, Michelle Monaghan joined the film to star as the female lead.[23] On June 11, Brian Cox joined the cast and plays military heavyweight Admiral Porter.[24] The part of \"Lady Lisa\", the glamorous protagonist of the fictional arcade game Dojo Quest, was offered to Elisha Cuthbert, but she turned down the role,[25] which went to Ashley Benson.[26] On July 9, Jane Krakowski joined the cast as the First Lady of the United States.[27]\n\n### Filming\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMovie prop for  in  for a New York subway entrance\n\nThe film was greenlit on a production budget of $135 million, which Doug Belgrad negotiated down to $110 million.[1] On March 25, 2014, the Ontario Media Development Corporation confirmed that the film would be shot in Toronto from May 28 to September 9 at Pinewood Toronto Studios.[28][29]\n\nPrincipal photography on the film commenced in Toronto on June 2, 2014, using downtown streets decorated to resemble New York City.[30] Given sequences such as the Pac-Man chase happened at night, often the filmmakers would close the streets off from traffic at 7 PM and redecorate them to resemble New York until it was dark enough, filming over-night.[31] On July 29, filming was done outside Markham, Ontario.[32] Filming was also done in the Rouge Park area, and extras were dressing in costume at Markham's Rouge Valley Mennonite Church.[32] On August 4, Gad, Dinklage, and Benson were spotted in Toronto filming scenes for the film on Bay Street, which was transformed into a city block in Washington, D.C., and littered with wrecked vehicles and giant holes in the pavement.[33] The Ontario Government Buildings was doubled to transform into a federal office building in Washington. Actors were aiming at aliens, which were added later with computer-generated imagery.[33] On August 26, filming took place in Cobourg.[34] Filming was completed in three months, with twelve hours of shooting each day.[35]\n\n### Post-production\n\nMost visual effects were handled by Digital Domain and Sony Pictures Imageworks, with nine other VFX companies playing supporting roles, all under the leadership of supervisor Matthew Butler and producer Denise Davis. Early tests began in October 2013, with most effects work starting after principal photography wrapped in September 2014 and finishing by June 2015. Video game characters would be built out of cubic voxels to resemble the low resolution pixel-based graphics from their origin games, while also emitting light and having raster scan defects in its animation to appear more like they came from a CRT monitor. Along with the actual sprite sheets, a major inspiration to integrate the film's conceptualized character designs into the third dimension was the cabinet art, which Imageworks visual effects supervisor Daniel Kramer considered \"was the intention the game creators wanted their technology to be, but the technology couldn't live up to creating that\". The most complex character to model was Q*bert, which interacted the most with humans and looked around despite being made out of voxels.[31][36][37] A pivotal moment in the film is the Pac-Man chase scene, where a giant Pac-Man pursues the protagonists through the city in mini-cars, symbolizing the ghosts from the original game. The stereo team developed 3D models of the main characters' faces using cyber scans of the actors.[38]\n\nThe animation team developed voxelized 3D versions of classic arcade characters, including Donkey Kong, Centipede, and Pac-Man, to integrate them into live-action settings. The voxelization process involved using boxes that changed per frame to mimic the pixel-based graphics,[39] and was particularly challenging for characters with complex movements, such as Donkey Kong. Pac-Man's animation required the voxelization to allow light emission, using an extra Mini Cooper rigged with yellow light panels and generators that was driven in Toronto.[40] Physical props, such as barrels,[39] were constructed for key sequences to provide actors with reference points for interaction. With the Donkey Kong set, reflections on the red stage and green screen required more digital replacements than anticipated.[39]\n\n### Music\n\nThe score was composed by Henry Jackman, who had previously scored Disney's Wreck-It Ralph.[41] In June 2015, Waka Flocka Flame released a single entitled \"Game On\", featuring Good Charlotte, which serves as part of the film's soundtrack.[42] Prominent contributions to the soundtrack include Cheap Trick's \"Surrender\" and a rendition of Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" remixed by Helmut VonLichten, the latter of which is featured during the Donkey Kong scenes. Additionally, a rendition of Tears for Fears' \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is performed by Ludlow.[43] Varèse Sarabande released the score soundtrack on July 24, 2015, the same day as the film.[44]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nPixels-themed building wrap in San Diego\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Pixels float at the 2015 Toronto Santa Claus Parade\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe first trailer was released on March 19, 2015, and received 34.3 million global views in 24 hours, breaking Sony's previous record held by The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (22 million views in 2014).[45] The second trailer was released on June 13, 2015.[46] Upon release of the trailer, similarities were noted between it and a segment of the Futurama episode \"Anthology of Interest II\".[47][48]\n\nSony created an \"Electric Dreams Factory Arcade\" with many of the arcade games featured in the film for various fan conventions, such as the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con and the 2015 Wizard World Philadelphia.[49][50] In Brazil, a promotional video was released on July 2, 2015, showing Adam Sandler interacting with Monica and Jimmy Five from local comic Monica's Gang.[51]\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on May 15, 2015,[52][53] but on August 12, 2014, the release date was pushed to July 24, 2015.[54] In the United States and Canada, it was released  in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema, the first film from Sony to be released in that format.[55] Pixels has a runtime of 106 minutes.[56]\n\n### Copyright takedown controversy\n\nColumbia Pictures hired Entura International to send Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices to websites hosting user-uploaded videos of the film.[57] The company filed DMCA takedown notices indiscriminately against several Vimeo videos containing the word \"Pixels\" in the title, including the 2010 award-winning short film the film is based on,[58] the official film trailer, a 2006 independently produced Cypriot film uploaded by the Independent Museum of Contemporary Art, a 2010 university work by a student of the Bucharest National University of Arts, a royalty-free stock footage clip and an independently produced project. The takedown notice sent by Entura stated that the works infringe a copyright they had the right to enforce; once the notice was made public, it was withdrawn.[59]\n\n### Home media\n\nPixels was released on Blu-ray (3D and 2D) and DVD on October 27, 2015, by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.[60] This release sold $12.4 million in DVD sales and $7.4 million in Blu-ray sales.[61]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nPixels grossed $78.7 million in North America and $164.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $244.9 million.[3] Reports of the production budget of the film range from $88 million to $129 million,[3] with Sony Pictures officially stating the cost as $110 million. The film received tax rebates of $19 million for filming in Canada.[62]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Pixels opened alongside Paper Towns, Southpaw, and The Vatican Tapes.[63][64] Its release date caused it to face competition from the holdovers Minions and Ant-Man, both of which were projected to earn around $20 million.[65][66] It made $1.5 million from its Thursday night showings at 2,776 theaters and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $9.2 million.[67][68][69] Through its opening weekend it grossed $24 million from 3,723 theaters, debuting at second place at the box office, behind Ant-Man.[70]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 208 reviews; the average audience rating is 4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Much like the worst arcade games from the era that inspired it, Pixels has little replay value and is hardly worth a quarter.\"[71] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[72] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[69]\n\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one star out of four, calling it \"a 3D metaphor for Hollywood's digital assault on our eyes and brains\" and deeming it \"relentless and exhausting\".[73] In Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir called the film \"another lazy Adam Sandler exercise in 80s Nostalgia\", as well as \"an overwhelmingly sad experience\" characterized by \"soul-sucking emptiness\".[74] Nigel Smith of The Guardian called it \"casually sexist, awkwardly structured, bro-centric\" and warned, \"Pity the poor souls who go into the comedy blockbuster thinking they've signed up to watch The Lego Movie by way of Independence Day. They'll be disappointed\".[75] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film no stars and wrote, \"Someone please retire Adam Sandler. Pixels is the last straw for this has-been...Every joke is forced, every special effect is un-special...The dipstick Pixels is about as much fun as a joystick and not even half as smart\".[76] \"It manages to achieve the weird effect of feeling overlong and choppy at the same time, like someone edited the film with a pair of garden shears,\" wrote Randy Cordova in The Arizona Republic.[77]\n\nMarjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle said the film is \"flat-footed and grows tedious after the first hour\" but praised the 3D effects which \"enhances the action\".[78] \"Everything is wrong here,\" wrote Megan Garber in The Atlantic Monthly, \"cinematically, creatively, maybe even morally. Because Pixels is one of those bad movies that isn't just casually bad, or shoot-the-moon bad, or too-close-to-the-sun bad, or actually kind of delightfully bad. It is tediously bad.\"[79] Peter Sobczynski, writing for RogerEbert.com, called the premise promising but the execution \"abysmal\".[80] Conversely, Katie Walsh, reviewing for the Chicago Tribune, was more positive, saying \"despite [its] unfortunate shortcomings, Pixels has its funny and fresh moments, thanks in large part to the supporting comic actors and inventive special effects\".[81]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                               | Date of ceremony    | Category                                               | Recipient(s)                                                      | Result    | Ref.    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Artios Awards                       | January 22, 2015    | Outstanding Achievement in Casting – Animation Feature | Brad Gilmore                                                      | Nominated | [82]    |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards             | February 27, 2016   | Worst Picture                                          | Pixels                                                            | Nominated | [83]    |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards             | February 27, 2016   | Worst Actor                                            | Adam Sandler[a]                                                   | Nominated | [83]    |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards             | February 27, 2016   | Worst Supporting Actor                                 | Josh Gad[b]                                                       | Nominated | [83]    |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards             | February 27, 2016   | Worst Supporting Actor                                 | Kevin James                                                       | Nominated | [83]    |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards             | February 27, 2016   | Worst Supporting Actress                               | Michelle Monaghan                                                 | Nominated | [83]    |\n| Golden Raspberry Awards             | February 27, 2016   | Worst Screenplay                                       | Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling (based on a work by Patrick Jean) | Nominated | [83]    |\n| Golden Trailer Awards               | May 4, 2016         | Golden Fleece                                          | Pixels                                                            | Won       | [84]    |\n| Houston Film Critics Society Awards | January 9, 2016     | Worst Film                                             | Pixels                                                            | Won       | [85]    |\n| Teen Choice Awards                  | August 16, 2015     | Choice Summer Movie Star: Male                         | Adam Sandler                                                      | Nominated | [86]    |\n\n## References\n\n### Notes\n\n- ^ Also for The Cobbler\n- ^ Also for The Wedding Ringer\n\n### Citations\n\n- ^ a b Siegel, Tatiana (December 5, 2014). \"Sony Hack Reveals Top-Secret Profitability of 2013 Movies\".

Loosely adapted from the 2010 short film Pixels by Patrick Jean (who serves as an executive producer on the film), the film stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, and Brian Cox. The film involves an alien force misinterpreting video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, to which they respond by attacking Earth with technological recreations of icons from the games. The President of the United States assembles a team of former arcade champions to lead the planet's defense.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Adam Sandler as Sam Brenner, a former arcade video game champion, Cooper's childhood friend and the leader of the Arcaders.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Kevin James as Will \"Chewie\" Cooper, the disgraced President of the United States, Brenner's childhood friend and a member of the Arcaders.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Michelle Monaghan as Lieutenant Colonel Violet van Patten, a unique weapons developer and specialist for the military and a member of the Arcaders.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Peter Dinklage as Eddie \"The Fireblaster\" Plant, Brenner's former rival and a member of the Arcaders.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Josh Gad as Ludlow \"The Wonder Kid\" Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed genius with poor social skills and a member of the Arcaders.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Brian Cox as Admiral James Porter, military heavyweight of the U.S. Navy.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Sean Bean as Corporal Hill.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Jane Krakowski as Jane Cooper, the First Lady of the United States and Cooper's wife.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Affion Crockett as Sergeant Dylan Cohan, a soldier present during the Guam attack.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Ashley Benson as Lady Lisa, the glamorous protagonist of the fictional arcade game Dojo Quest.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Matt Lintz as Matty van Patten, Violet's son.</Actor>\n        <Actor>Lainie Kazan as Mickey Lamonsoff, Ludlow's grandmother.</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    \n    <Production>\n        <Development>\n            The film is based on Patrick Jean's video-game-themed short film, Pixels.

In 2051, they manage to cobble together a time machine (the Jumplink) to 2022. So, naturally, they start recruiting people from the past to help fight the war in the future.  We follow family man and ex-Green Beret Dan Forester as he is drafted to fight in the Tomorrow War.\n\nThis movie was jolly time travel alien war fun. Great creature effects, solid action setpieces, and a fair number of decent ideas. Also JK Simmons and Sam Richardson are wonderful.  Apropos of this blog, the time travel is perfectly consistent, if not particularly complex.\n\nIt was not, I’m afraid, a particularly smart movie. The vast majority of that is related to characters doing stupid things, but there were a few times where the laws of physics were avoided as well. I was going to primarily write this post about the chronodynamics of The Tomorrow War, but that’s such a short read I decided to add on some script-doctor sections about where the script went wrong and how it could have been improved.\n\nBy its nature, this post is going to be particularly critical of the movie. Nevertheless, I did enjoy it, and it’s streaming free on Amazon Prime. If you have any interest in it at all, you should give it a try.\n\n## Chronodynamics\n\nThe chronodynamics are pretty straightforward: It is a branching timeline, with a portal linking the two branches.  We’ll call the original, prime Timeline A, and the branch Timeline B–so young Muri is on Timeline B and adult Muri is on Timeline A.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe portal’s mouths move forward on both timelines at the same rate, the separation is always going to be 28 years (the link in 2022 started in December, so it’s a little less than the 29 years you’d think based on just the years). So in 2052 on Timeline A, the portal will link to 2023 on Timeline B:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOf course, we are told that humanity won’t last until 2052, so this is just an example.\n\nWe could also redraw the diagram so the timelines are synced up vertically:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe portal can be flipped on and off, with varying degrees of success, but it cannot apparently be adjusted.\nAnd that’s all there is to the temporal mechanics of The Tomorrow War! Let’s move on to other things to nitpick. Spoilers ahead!\n\n## Better Strategy\n\nWe’ll start with the in-universe Watsonian perspective–what the character’s should have done with the situation they were given.\n\nThe humans of timeline A are down to a population of about 500,000, meaning 99.5% of the worldwide population has been killed (assuming a population growth to 9.6B by 2048). With their limited resources, they are able to cobble together a janky time machine. It works, but it’s finicky. They manage to find a good point to go back to, the most globally televised event of the year: the World Cup. They explain their situation to the world of Timeline B, and we have our starting point.\n\nSo we have two possible objectives: Save Timeline A and save Timeline B. We immediately have two issues: 1) By the time the portal is opened, Timeline A only has 500,000 humans left.  Timeline A is already lost. Muri, the highest ranking officer we meet in Timeline A, tells us they already know that A is doomed. Defeating the Whitespikes in Timeline A is effectively not a possibility. 2) Even if we assume that defeating the Whitespikes is possible, Timeline B has no incentive to help Timeline A, certainly not to the tune of thousands of conscripts.  So right off the bat, the only viable objective is saving Timeline B.\n\nNow, technically there actually is a way to save Timeline A. Not the Earth, though. The people.  Hundreds of thousands of people are sent from Timeline B to Timeline A to fight in the war, so it is logistically possible to evacuate hundreds of thousands from Timeline B to Timeline A.  Further, anyone who accepts refugees from Timeline A gains a considerable boon–30 years worth of advanced technical and historical knowledge, experience using future technology, and lest we forget, the knowledge necessary to prepare for the war.\n\nIgnoring all that, Timeline B opts to try and save the Earth in Timeline A. As far as we are aware, there’s no transfer of information, ideas, technology, or materials; Timeline B just sends human fodder to Timeline A. We know this because apparently no one had previously analyzed any Whitespike materials to find their point of origin until Dan talked to a high school student.  So that really should have been the first thing anyone did.\n\nWe will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that, to the best of their knowledge, they needed the toxin to ensure that any timeline survives. After all, if they fail to locate the Whitespike point of origin in Timeline B, they will need some superweapon to fend them off. In that case we justify having to send natives of Timeline B to Timeline A, in order to gather information and resources.  But this just reinforces the need for information transfer between A and B. It also requires a massive shift in the tactics employed.\n\nSpeaking of which…\n\n## Better Tactics\n\nOnce we assume that there’s no victory in conventional warfare, it requires a paradigm shift in tactics. Just in general, the tactics employed seem to be of a “throw as many bodies at the problem as possible” bent.  The missions should have all been aimed at the only known solution–the female toxin. We know they weren’t, because if they were then someone would have told the draftees in Timeline B.\n\nWhen it came to training, the objective seemed to be to get as many people killed as possible. Training was rushed, supplies were limited, draftees weren’t even told what they were up against, and criteria for selecting draftees were nonsensical.\n\nStarting with that last one: For some reason, people are only drafted if they’re already dead in Timeline A (which almost everyone should be, because there’s only 500,000 people left), while only young people are sent to Timeline B to man the outpost. I believe we’re supposed to assume a paradox will occur if they don’t do this, but that is a somewhat ridiculous idea in a branching timeline. No real reason is given, but we might guess that they are using it for moral justification, i.e., “they’re going to die soon anyway, so it’s ok if we send them to die in the future war.” As for why only young people were sent back, perhaps it was just in case things go sideways and they’re cut off, so they can live a long full life?\n\nOn to the actual training.  There’s no point in keeping the aliens’ morphology a secret. The people were already drafted, so all they’re doing is increasing the chance of panic because they’re not prepared for what they see.  You can maintain the creepiness of the reveal if you just use drawings to show them, like this:\n\nI asked my wife to draw a cute Whitespike for me; this is the result (inspired by Whitespike concept artwork).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aren’t privy to the majority of interuniversal missions, so we have to base our analysis off the one we do see, and the first mission we see is fraught with tactical blunders.  The intent was to retrieve specimens and personnel from the most important R&amp;D installation in the world. Inasmuch as the war was winnable, it hinged on the success of this mission. And they decided to send in a bunch of rookies with barely a day’s training in.  Further, they intended to firebomb the area, despite it already being lost and devoid of human life, and despite it containing vital materials. The firebombing served no tactical purpose except to help the Whitespikes.\n\nAnd now that I think of it, what was that lab doing in Chicago?  They seemed to have a fully functioning lab in the fortified atoll, so why leave one in the middle of a ruined city?\n\nAs for prep, let’s talk about firearms.  The popguns they give the conscripts are near worthless.  They only deal damage when fired at the neck or underbelly–not an easy feat for people with 1 week of training and who are completely unprepared to face such a monster.  They needed higher-power armaments–armor-piercing, or explosive-tipped, or something. We see later that a mounted .50 caliber can mow through them, so it is possible for conventional arms to work. Heavier weaponry might be a nuisance to carry around, but it’s better than carrying around the BB guns they had.\n\nSpeaking of the .50, vehicular combat is where humans should have the clear advantage.  While a humvee is easily capsized by a Whitespike, a tank or an APC should fare better.  Whitespikes’ projectiles embed themselves in the human body, which means they are not going to be strong enough to pierce a tank.  Further, humans have total air superiority. Whitespikes can glide like flying squirrels, but they have no clear way to effectively fend off aircraft.  At a high enough elevation, even a stationary aircraft would be impossible to hit for Whitespikes; a dirigible would be an effective attack vehicle.\n\n## Better Screenplay\n\nNot to kick a movie while it’s down, but I might as well talk about some of the kinks in the screenplay that could make the overall narrative flow better–the Doylist perspective.\n\nDan’s character arc needs to be better fleshed out. We get the first seed of discontent when he’s denied a job offer, and he’s mad his dad ran away. Cut to: he leaves his wife then dies in a car accident. He’s never given any clear flaw or character trajectory. Being ambitious isn’t a big enough character flaw that it clearly leads to abandoning your family, and certainly not big enough that he needs redemption for it.  And if it’s supposed to be a character flaw, he shouldn’t solve it by actually saving the world; that just validates the flaw!\n\nThe toxin ended up being a big shaggy dog story. We spend half the movie developing this toxin that’s supposed to end the war (and Dan apparently attempts to sabotage it by diving into a sea of Whitespikes, though he is counter-sabotaged by being recalled to Timeline B), and the toxin ends up being irrelevant. It’s not used in Timeline A, because Timeline A is lost, and in Timeline B it’s less effective than just using C4.  In fact, the toxin actually almost messes everything up in Timeline B–by administering it poorly, they wake up the Whitespikes and almost release them into the world; if they had blown up the ship in the first place (which they end up doing anyways), they would have circumvented this trouble.\n\nFurther, we are never shown how the toxin is viable on a large scale. If it’s supposed to be able to end the war, it can’t just be delivered individually to each Whitespike–it would be cheaper, easier, and quicker to just use explosives.  They say they’ve developed the male toxin, so we should see that in action.\n\nWe are told the Jumplink time machine is held together by chewing gum and chicken wire.  There is a whole timeline full of materials and experts who could build a new one.  There needs to be a reason that they can’t.  At least tell us that people from Timeline B are being trained and trying their best to maintain it.\n\nHundreds of thousands of folks dying with $1M life insurance leaves quite a bill for the government to pay out at the end of the day. The logistics of that need to be figured out.\n\nWhile the scene of people breaking on a skyscraper is haunting, having everyone who lands in the pool survive without injury isn’t how water works. Following hundreds of feet into water is going to cause injury or death without proper landing posture.  This scene plays a major role in setting the tone moving forward, but after Muri says “Somebody find out what the hell went wrong”, we never get any updates about what went wrong.\n\nFor some reason, the entire world is motivated enough to instate a draft, but not motivated enough to send a small team to investigate the crash site–a small team led by the guy who just brought back the war-ending weapon.\n\nThere’s plenty of smaller issues (like why didn’t they kill the female when the males started swarming toward it, or why didn’t they set up better perimeter defenses on the atoll?) but I think this is a good overview of the issues facing the movie.\n\n## The Tomorrow War: It’s not just a sci-fi movie, it’s every sci-fi movie\n\nWe’ve got:\n\n- The time travel alien war of Edge of Tomorrow\n- The army of humans being tossed into a meat grinder war of Starship Troopers\n- The crashed derelict ship full of bioweapons of Alien and The Thing (bonus for it being crashed in the ice)\n- The aliens being revealed in a horror ambush of Aliens\n- The zergling design of Starcraft\n- The opening “Shoot her!” scene of Jurassic Park\n- The sexual dimorphism and rarity that becomes the key to ending the war of Reign of Fire\n- The floating fortress of Waterworld\n- The final kill of Tremors\n- The daddy-daughter time travel of Interstellar\n- The hanging bodies of Predator\n- The global warming lesson of The Day After Tomorrow\n\nAnd more!\n\n## 2 comments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlus we never find out if the Miami Dolphins win any Super Bowl.

In 2048, the Whitespikes appear essentially out of nowhere and start wiping out humanity. In 2051, they manage to cobble together a time machine (the Jumplink) to 2022. So, naturally, they start recruiting people from the past to help fight the war in the future. We follow family man and ex-Green Beret Dan Forester as he is drafted to fight in the Tomorrow War.",
                    "review": "This movie was jolly time travel alien war fun. Great creature effects, solid action setpieces, and a fair number of decent ideas. Also JK Simmons and Sam Richardson are wonderful. The time travel is perfectly consistent, if not particularly complex.",
                    "critique": "It was not, I’m afraid, a particularly smart movie. The vast majority of that is related to characters doing stupid things, but there were a few times where the laws of physics were avoided as well. By its nature, this post is going to be particularly critical of the movie. Nevertheless, I did enjoy it, and it’s streaming free on Amazon Prime. If you have any interest in it at all, you should give it a try.",
                    "chronodynamics": "The chronodynamics are pretty straightforward: It is a branching timeline, with a portal linking the two branches. The portal’s mouths move forward on both timelines at the same rate, the separation is always going to be 28 years.",
                    "strategy": "The humans of timeline A are down to a population of about 500,000, meaning 99.5% of the worldwide population has been killed. They manage to find a good point to go back to, the most globally televised event of the year: the World Cup.",
                    "tactics": "Once we assume that there’s no victory in conventional warfare, it requires a paradigm shift in tactics. The missions should have all been aimed at the only known solution–the female toxin.",
                    "screenplayIssues": "Dan’s character arc needs to be better fleshed out. The toxin ended up being a big shaggy dog story. We spend half the movie developing this toxin that’s supposed to end the war, and it ends up being irrelevant.",

Starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, the film takes place in a future where most of Europe is occupied by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a public relations officer with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a landing operation against the aliens, only to find himself experiencing a time loop as he tries to find a way to defeat the invaders. Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson also appear in supporting roles.\n\nIn late 2009, 3 Arts Entertainment purchased the rights to All You Need Is Kill and sold the spec script to Warner Bros. Pictures The studio produced Edge of Tomorrow with the involvement of 3 Arts, the novel's publisher Viz Media, and Australian production company Village Roadshow. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, outside London, and other locations, such as London's Trafalgar Square and the coastal Saunton Sands. A total of nine companies handled the visual effects.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow was released theatrically in select territories on May 30, 2014, and in the United States on June 6, 2014. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the plot, direction, action sequences, and performances.[7] It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run.[5] Since then, it has been considered one of the best action films of the 2010s.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2015, an alien race known as \"Mimics\" lands in Germany and swiftly conquers much of continental Europe, killing millions. By 2020, humanity has formed a global military alliance, the United Defense Force (UDF), to combat the Mimics. However, victory remained elusive until the recent Battle of Verdun, which was secured by the celebrated war hero Sergeant Rita Vrataski.\n\nIn Britain, the UDF masses forces for a major invasion of France. General Brigham orders public affairs officer Major William Cage to cover the offensive from the frontline, but the inexperienced and cowardly Cage attempts to blackmail Brigham into rescinding the order. Brigham has Cage arrested, demoted to Private and sent to the military base at Heathrow Airport to join the invasion as infantry. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, who dislike and belittle him. The following day, the invasion forces land on a French beach but are ambushed and massacred by Mimics. Cage uses a Claymore mine to kill a larger \"Alpha\" Mimic, becoming covered in its blood and mortally wounding himself in the ensuing explosion.\n\nCage suddenly awakens at Heathrow, finding he is reliving the previous morning. He makes failed attempts to warn against the invasion and experiences multiple loops in which he dies on the beach and awakens at Heathrow, his battlefield knowledge and skills increasing with each loop. He tries to save Vrataski's life so she can lead them but, after recognizing his apparent prescience, she allows herself to die, ordering Cage to find her on his next loop.\n\nCage quickly convinces Vrataski of the reset because she gained the same power after exposure to an Alpha's blood. Her loops enabled her, an initially inexperienced soldier, to win at Verdun, but a later blood transfusion removed the power. Vrataski takes Cage to Mimic expert Dr. Carter, who explains the creatures are a superorganism controlled by a single, gigantic \"Omega\" Mimic. Whenever the Alpha Mimics are killed, the Omega restarts a loop and adjusts its tactics until the Mimics win. Vrataski realizes the Mimics allowed the UDF victory at Verdun to make them overconfident in their new mech-suits and lure them into overcommitting their forces in retaking Europe, allowing the Mimics to exterminate most of the resistance.\n\nCage spends many loops training with Vrataski so they can reach the Omega, but he begins to care for her and struggles after seeing her repeatedly die. He experiences a vision of the Omega concealed in a German dam, and he and Vrataski seek it out. During the journey, the pair bond, but Vrataski remains distant, having seen someone she cared about die hundreds of times at Verdun. She eventually determines that this is not the first loop in which they approached the Omega. Cage reveals that she always dies before reaching the dam, regardless of his actions, and he is unwilling to kill the Omega and end the loops if she will remain dead. Upset, Vrataski attempts to leave but is killed by a Mimic. Despondent, during the next loop, Cage travels to the dam alone. He learns the vision was a trap and is ambushed by an Alpha, but Cage drowns before it can remove his power.\n\nTo find the Omega, Cage and Vrataski sneak into General Brigham's office and pressure him into handing over a prototype transponder designed by Carter. Having used it to locate the Omega beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, Cage is knocked unconscious during their escape and given a blood transfusion for his injuries, removing his power.\n\nVrataski frees Cage, and he uses his detailed knowledge of J-Squad to convince them to help destroy the Omega. They fly to Paris, where the squad members sacrifice themselves to ensure Cage and Vrataski reach the Louvre. Cornered by an Alpha, Vrataski kisses Cage, lamenting that she does not have more time to get to know him. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he drops several grenades that destroy the Omega and bathe him in its blood.\n\nCage awakens before his first meeting with General Brigham, and witnesses a news announcement that all Mimics are dead following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage returns to Heathrow and finds Vrataski. Oblivious to his identity, she inquires what he wants; Cage chuckles.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n() and  (), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n- Tom Cruise as Major William Cage\n- Emily Blunt as Sergeant Rita Vrataski\n- Bill Paxton as Master Sergeant Farell\n- Brendan Gleeson as General Brigham\n- Noah Taylor as Dr. Noah Carter\n- Kick Gurry as Griff\n- Dragomir Mrsic as Kuntz\n- Charlotte Riley as Nance\n- Jonas Armstrong as Skinner\n- Franz Drameh as Ford\n- Masayoshi Haneda as Takeda\n- Tony Way as Kimmel\n- Lara Pulver as Karen Lord\n- Madeleine Mantock as Corporal Julie Montgomery\n- Harry Landis as Old Man 3\n- Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Dr. Whittle (uncredited)\n\n## Crew\n\nDirector Doug Liman at the Paris premiere of the film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Doug Liman – director[8]\n- Christopher McQuarrie – co-writer[8]\n- Jez Butterworth – co-writer[8]\n- John-Henry Butterworth – co-writer[8]\n- Erwin Stoff – producer[8]\n- Tom Lassally – producer[8]\n- Jeffrey Silver – producer[8]\n- Gregory Jacobs – producer[8]\n- Jason Hoffs – producer[8]\n- Dion Beebe – cinematographer[8]\n- Oliver Scholl – production designer[8]\n- Kate Hawley – costume designer[8]\n- James Herbert – editor[8]\n- Laura Jennings – editor[8]\n- Christophe Beck – composer[8]\n- Nick Davis – visual effects supervisor[8]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development and writing\n\nViz Media published All You Need Is Kill in North America in 2009 as one of four translated Japanese science fiction novels that initiated its Haikasoru imprint.[9] After drawing the interest of producer Erwin Stoff,[10] his company 3 Arts Entertainment optioned the novel that same year. 3 Arts collaborated with the publisher's filmmaking subsidiary Viz Productions, headed by Jason Hoffs. Viz Media president Hidemi Fukuhara served as executive producer.[11][12] Instead of making a pitch to a major studio to purchase the property and proceed with writing and producing a film adaptation, the company developed a spec script to show the studios.[11] Stoff approached writer Dante Harper and sent him a copy of the novel. Harper found the book \"too complex\" to properly adapt, but, despite the prospect of not getting paid, he chose to \"risk it\" and accepted the job, taking eight months to write the script.[13] Upon completion, Warner Bros. Pictures purchased it in a $3 million deal in April 2010.[11] The studio hired Doug Liman to direct the film the following August.[14] Harper's screenplay was listed in the 2010 edition of the Black List, a survey of most-liked unproduced screenplays.[15]\n\nIn June 2011, Joby Harold was hired to rewrite the screenplay.[16] By September, Warner Bros. approached Brad Pitt to star;[17] after he declined, the studio then approached Tom Cruise.[18] Once Cruise accepted, the script changed the age of the leading role to fit the actors. In December 2011, Cruise officially joined the film.[19] Emily Blunt entered negotiations to star opposite Cruise in April 2012.[20] Screenwriting duo Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman also delivered a draft of their own but their script wasn't used in the final version.[21]\n\nSix months before filming started, Liman discarded two-thirds of Harper's original script. Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth were hired to rewrite the script. Screenwriter Simon Kinberg took over from the Butterworths, and eight weeks before the start of filming, Kinberg was replaced by Christopher McQuarrie.[22] McQuarrie was introduced to the project while directing Cruise in Jack Reacher. While reading the earlier script McQuarrie \"understood very clearly what the premise of the story was and what they were looking for in terms of characters\".[23] Even if the previous scripts were darker, Cruise stressed the importance of the story's humor to McQuarrie.[24] The actor compared Cage's violent demises to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, declaring, \"It's fun coming up with new ways to kill yourself.\"[22]\n\nThe screenplay did not yet have a satisfactory ending, and, despite the producers and studio executives worried about starting filming without a set conclusion, Liman opted to finish the script during principal photography.[22] McQuarrie at one point suggested adding a twist involving the Mimics figuring out Cage's attack on Paris and resetting time during his strike, but discarded it as \"you were so exhausted by the time you got to that point.\"[24] Eventually, McQuarrie considered that focusing on the comedic aspects meant \"it needed to end in a way that wasn't harsh\", and thus opted to end the plot where it started, on the helicopter bringing Cage to London, fulfilling the notion that \"comedies generally have to go back to the way things were\".[24]\n\n### Filming\n\nProduction began at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden near London, which Warner Brothers had purchased as a permanent studio site. WB had been renting space there for its production of the Harry Potter films, but had been leaving the sets up permanently for nearly a decade and eventually chose to make the site semi-permanent.[25] The parts with Tom Cruise in the opening scene were filmed in Liman's editing room, with the actor doing his own make-up and hair, leading the director to say it \"may be the most independent thing I've ever done.\"[26] Though Liman intended to film the beach battle on-location, the studio instead ended up building a beach set at the studio site.[22] The set was surrounded by chroma key green screens, which the visual effects artists later used to extend the beach with plates shot at Saunton Sands in North Devon.[27] It was intended for the battle scenes to be reminiscent of coastal battles during World War II such as the Invasion of Normandy and the Battle of Dunkirk.[28]\n\nPrincipal photography began at Leavesden on October 1, 2012.[29] The Los Angeles Times said on the second day, Liman \"demanded a total reshoot of everything filmed on Day 1\", which concerned producers.[22] Filming on the beach set was scheduled to last two weeks, but extended to nearly three months due to what the Los Angeles Times called \"the director's self-described 'workshop-y' filming style\".[22] Filming also took place in Trafalgar Square in London on Saturday November 24, 2012. The square was closed to the public, and tanks were brought in to film the action scenes.[30] The brief scene in the Square required closing 36 roads, diverting 122 bus routes and booking all available rooms in nearby hotels and a costly restoration of a historic wicket at a local cricket ground after one of the production helicopters knocked it over.[31] A former army base in the village of Barton Stacey in Hampshire was also used as a filming location for two weeks.[32] Filming also took place at Essex &amp; Suffolk former water treatment facilities in Hanningfield, Essex.\n\nLiman said filming took place seven days a week using two crews to film 20 days in addition to what had originally been scheduled. The crew struggled with changeable British weather since the film was supposed to be set in one day and had to maintain the same weather.[33] The indoor beach set also became muddy, requiring the visual effects artists to enhance the environment with digital sand and surf.[27][34] Though filming concluded by August 2013, actor Jeremy Piven was added to the cast and extra scenes including him were filmed;[35] ultimately, however, Piven did not appear in the finished film.[36] Cinematographer Dion Beebe made his first feature film with Liman, with whom he had worked previously on commercials. Beebe's approach was to develop \"a world under siege, but not a bleak, dark, post-apocalyptic landscape\";[37] Beebe preferred to avoid the saturated bleach bypass look. 35 mm film was used instead of digital cameras to evoke the World War II footage that provided inspiration for the battle scenes.[37]\n\n### Battle suits\n\nProduction designer Oliver Scholl and his team worked with lead builder Pierre Bohanna to develop concept art for several battle suit options based on contemporary, real-world powered exoskeleton initiatives, such as those supported by DARPA. When director Doug Liman chose a design, the team built an aluminum prototype frame that had pivot points and hinges. Costume designer Kate Hawley contributed a gritty aesthetic design for the color palettes and surface treatments. While the design was meant to be utilitarian, it was also created so the actors could be seen in the suits and also run in them. The team created a foam mock-up of Tom Cruise so the frame could be tailored for him. The team handcrafted 70 hard material and 50 soft material battle suits in the course of almost five months. There were three versions of the battle suits: \"grunts, dogs, and tanks\". The battle suit for Blunt's character was given red slash marks \"as if to say she had been to hell and back and lived to tell about it.\"[38]\n\nCruise, known for performing his own film stunts, also did so in Edge of Tomorrow. Both he and Blunt wore the heavy metal suits.[39] The battle suits weighed 85 pounds (39 kg) on average; the heavier versions weighed around 130 pounds (59 kg) due to being equipped with a mock sniper rifle and rocket launcher.[40] Blunt trained three months for her role, \"focusing on everything from weights to sprints to yoga, aerial wire work and gymnastics\", and studying the Israeli combat system Krav Maga.[40]\n\nEach actor needed four people to help put on the battle suit. Initially, Cruise needed 30 minutes to put on the suit and another 30 minutes to remove it. Ultimately, the time was reduced to 30 seconds.[38] Between takes, the actors would be suspended by chains from iron frames to take the weight of the suits off their shoulders.[41]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nNine companies handled the visual effects for Edge of Tomorrow under VFX supervisor Nick Davis.[42] Davis worked with the crew of The Third Floor on the film's previsualization process. Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI) worked on the first two acts of the film and created over 400 shots, including photorealistic environments, battle scenes, and computer-generated creatures and characters. One major shot involved covering London Heathrow Airport with military troops, vehicles, and aircraft; SPI split some of the work with RodeoFX. Cinesite joined late in the production and developed 221 shots for ten key sequences, with 189 appearing in the final cut.[34]\n\nAn Alpha during the beach battle. The design for the extraterrestrial race aimed to be as otherworldly as possible, with a body consisting mostly of tentacles built out of obsidian-like shards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDesigners created the alien Mimics to look different from any terrestrial animal. Davis and Liman favored an early model composed primarily of tentacles. SPI's Dan Kramer described its appearance as \"heavy black spaghetti\" and noted that the modelers faced a challenge creating the tentacled creatures.[34] A technical animator created an Autodesk Maya plugin that made the movement of each tentacle independent.[43] Since Liman did not want the Mimics to look \"too organic or terrestrial\", Imageworks' artists devised the idea of making the aliens out of an obsidian-like material, \"basically a glass that could cut\".[44] Various debris was incorporated within the tentacles to give the creature a sense of weight and fast movement. The Alphas were given a definable head area to show their status as more sentient, while receiving a different color and a bigger size compared to the Mimic grunts.[44] Cinesite created the mechanical Mimics used in the training areas,[45] while Moving Picture Company (MPC) created the Omega in a digital environment into which the visual effects artists composited underwater footage filmed at Leavesden's water tank.[46]\n\nAnimators created digital versions of the battle suits, at times with the soldiers inside them. On the set, a 3D scanner booth digitized the actors, while hand scanners captured the textures of the practical suits. Imageworks received pieces of the suits for reference. The company's library of reflection data on various materials helped enhance the armor's shading.[44] SPI's crew created the base at Heathrow by merging the set at Leavesden with digitally altered footage from the airport; the film's dropships, barracks and mess halls replaced the existing aircraft.[34] Framestore created the digital Paris and recreated it with photomodeling from three days of visits. Given that the city is a no-fly zone, Framestore's artists obtained their aerial images by climbing an 80-meter crane parked in the Louvre courtyard.[44] The quadcopter dropships were based on the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey that can tilt its rotors to fly as either planes or helicopters, while having a design closer to the Quad TiltRotor.[47] Aside from the crashed ship on the beachhead and a gimbal set to depict the plane used by Cage's squad, the film used digital models for most ships. The computer-generated dropships had some of Imageworks' heaviest detail given the proximity of the actors to the aircraft in the camp scenes; the visual effects artists wanted to make sure the ships broke apart realistically during the crashes.[44]\n\nPrime Focus World converted the film into 3D in post-production using the same tools for the stereoscopy as in World War Z and Gravity. The company made use of scans of the cast's faces from film production while vendor Nvizible helped the company convert the hologram table used by Dr. Carter.[44]\n\n### Music\n\nComposer Christophe Beck was a late addition to the film, taking over from Ramin Djawadi, who was Liman's first choice to replace his frequent collaborator John Powell, as Powell was on sabbatical.[48] Edge of Tomorrow marked Beck's first science fiction film score.[49] To prepare, Beck watched the film with temp tracks, including one from the 2012 film Battleship. He experimented with repeating the music with the scenes, but because this approach did not frequently fit the events on the screen, Beck used minimal repetition in the film. \"The day is reset dozens of times in the film and it would get very repetitive to approach that musically the same way every time\", Beck recalled.[50] He initially tried for \"traditional heroic themes\" that involved horns and trumpets, but he said Liman \"preferred a non-traditional approach, driven by percussion and distorted orchestra\". To that end, Beck used the pizzicato playing technique, \"not in the traditional, plinky-plinky-isn't-this-funny way, but a little darker, and always accompanied by some higher concept synth colors\".[49] The distorted orchestral samples enhanced the comedic tone of the extended sequences where Cage recurrently dies in battle, as the director felt it was important for the audience to find humor in this sequence.[48] With Liman's approach, the composer said there were \"only a couple of traditional themes\" in the film, including one for Emily Blunt's character Rita.[50]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nI think the word 'kill' in a title is very tricky in today's world. I don't know that people want to be bombarded with that word. I don't know that people want to be opening the newspaper and seeing that word. We see it enough in kind of real newspaper headlines, and I don't think we need to see it when we're looking at a movie.\n\nWarner Bros. invested over $100 million in the marketing campaign for Edge of Tomorrow.[52] The film was initially titled All You Need Is Kill after the light novel, but as filming ended in July 2013, Warner Bros. changed the title to Edge of Tomorrow;[53] Warner Bros. president Sue Kroll said the title was changed partly due to \"negative chatter\" about the word \"kill\" in the title.[54] Doug Liman, who said he rejected the title All You Need Is Kill because it \"didn't feel like it was the tone of the movie I had made\", wanted to rename the film Live Die Repeat, but Warner decided to use that just as the tagline.[26]\n\nThe film was promoted at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013,[53] and at WonderCon in Anaheim, California in April 2014.[41] Turner Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Time Warner like the studio Warner Bros., promoted the film across its TV properties, including CNN, TNT, TBS, Adult Swim, TruTV, and Funny or Die. Variety said the move \"put forth the notion that buying bigger packages of advertisements across a TV company's holdings is a viable option in an increasingly fragmented TV-viewing landscape\". Turner also launched a website which would unlock film-related content like \"a 3D game, back stories and artwork\" if its promotional hashtag was circulated enough through the social media website Twitter.[55]\n\nViz Media released a new edition of the light novel on April 29, 2014, retitled Edge of Tomorrow.[56] It also published a graphic novel adaptation of the light novel on May 5, 2014.[57]\n\nFor the film's release on home media, Warner Bros. formed two teams for a September 28, 2014, Tough Mudder endurance event series in Black Diamond, Washington.[58] The teams included YouTube personalities and participants from the TV series American Ninja Warrior. Warner Bros. based the teams on the soldiers from \"J Squad\" in the film. To promote teamwork, the two teams competed in a Tough Mudder obstacle course.[59]\n\n### Box office forecast\n\nTom Cruise in Paris at the French premiere of Edge of Tomorrow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWeeks before the film's release, reports in early May 2014 predicted an underwhelming box-office performance in the North American (United States and Canada) box office for Edge of Tomorrow.[60] Variety noted a \"worrisome lack of buzz\" leading up to the film's release.[54] Initial box office tracking at the start of the month for the film estimated a gross between $25 million and $30 million on its opening weekend.[61] Several weeks later, the estimate decreased by $5 million.[54] The film planned to compete with The Fault in Our Stars in the same opening weekend with an equivalent estimated gross around $25 million. TheWrap predicted that this competition could potentially affect the opening weekend gross of Edge of Tomorrow.[61] In contrast, Variety said Edge of Tomorrow could serve as counterprogramming to The Fault in Our Stars since that film's demographic is women under 25 years old.[54]\n\nWith its budget of over $175 million, The Hollywood Reporter called Edge of Tomorrow, one of the \"biggest box-office risks\" in North America for mid-2014. The trade paper said the film was similar to Oblivion, a 2013 science fiction film that also starred Tom Cruise, and that like Oblivion, it would likely perform better outside North America.[62] Box Office Mojo reported that four of Cruise's films with original material—Valkyrie (2008), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), and Oblivion (2013)—failed to gross more than $100 million in North America. The website forecast that Edge of Tomorrow would gross $90 million in North America and $220 million in other territories.[63] TheWrap said that the studio focused on theatrical releases in other territories where Cruise \"remains a major force\" in drawing audiences.[61] Variety, writing from the US perspective, said, \"Media reports have been quick to speculate that Edge of Tomorrow may be one of the summer's first big bombs based on the lack of enthusiasm by U.S. audiences. That may come to pass, but these reports downplay the centrality of foreign markets in today's globalized movie industry.\"[60]\n\nIn the week prior to the release of Edge of Tomorrow in North America, its estimated opening-weekend gross increased from the mid-$20 million range to $27 million.[64]\n\n### Theatrical run\n\nEdge of Tomorrow initiated its theatrical run in several territories on May 28, 2014, and rolled out to a total of 28 territories for its opening weekend of May 30 – June 1, 2014.[60][65] It grossed $20.1 million on its opening weekend.[66] For the second weekend of June 6–8, 2014, it was released in 36 additional territories.[67] Edge of Tomorrow grossed $100.2 million in North America and $270.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $370.5 million.[5] After the film's theatrical run, Entertainment Weekly said it had a \"lukewarm box-office reception\" despite praise from critics.[68]\n\n#### Opening weekend\n\nThe film had premiere screenings in London, Paris, and New York City on May 28, 2014. The cast and the crew mimicked the film's time loop premise by attending the premieres in a single day, traveling westward to attend them on a staggered schedule.[69] The film was screened in New York City at 11:59 pm, the time chosen to refer to the film title.[70] The film was released in theaters in 28 territories—including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Indonesia—on the weekend of May 30, 2014.[60] Certain territories with strong association football followings were chosen so the film could screen to audiences before the month-long 2014 FIFA World Cup began on June 12, 2014. Edge of Tomorrow competed against Maleficent starring Angelina Jolie, which opened the same weekend in 46 territories.[60]\n\nOn its opening weekend in 5,018 screens across 28 territories, Edge of Tomorrow grossed $20.1 million.[66] The Hollywood Reporter called the film's debut a \"soft\" opening. In many territories, Edge of Tomorrow ranked third behind fellow new release Maleficent and holdover X-Men: Days of Future Past. These included the United Kingdom, where the film ranked third and grossed $3.1 million, where Cruise's 2013 film Oblivion had opened with $7.6 million, and Germany, with an income of $2.1 million compared to Oblivion's $2.6 million. Edge of Tomorrow ranked first in Indonesia and Taiwan, grossing $2 million and $1.9 million, respectively.[71] Its opening weekend in 286 screens in Indonesia was Tom Cruise's biggest opening, to date, in the country.[66] The film also grossed $1.5 million in Italy and $1.5 million in Spain.[67] Deadline.com said the film had good word of mouth, citing significant increases in Saturday grosses compared to the Friday grosses in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain.[66] Bloomberg Businessweek reported that $110 million was grossed in the first week of release and summarized its debut, \"While it did solid business in Asia, its reception in Germany, France, and the U.K. has been tepid.\"[72]\n\n#### Second weekend\n\nIn the first week of June 2014, Edge of Tomorrow opened in 36 additional markets, including North America, China, Russia, South Korea and France. The film was now showing in 63 countries and 19,000 screens.[73] The film led the global weekend box office with $28.8 million in North America and $82 million elsewhere.[73] The debut in China occurred on Monday, June 2, to take advantage of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.[74] Edge of Tomorrow topped the Chinese box office with $26.7 million,[75] encompassing 4.06 million admissions in 99,768 screenings.[76] Edge of Tomorrow's debut in both Russia ($8.6 million) and South Korea ($3.8 million, taking advantage of a five-day holiday) marked Tom Cruise's highest-grossing opening weekend in both countries.[77][78]\n\nEdge of Tomorrow was released in 3,490 theaters in North America on June 6, 2014.[79] The ticket service Fandango reported advance tickets surpassed Tom Cruise's previous film Oblivion, but were being overcome by the competing film The Fault in Our Stars.[80] Edge of Tomorrow grossed $28.8 million on the opening weekend, ranking it third below The Fault in Our Stars ($48 million) and Maleficent ($34.3 million).[81] Polling firm CinemaScore said 61% of the opening weekend audiences were male.[82] It reported that audiences overall gave Edge of Tomorrow a \"B+\" grade, where younger filmgoers gave \"A\" and \"A−\" grades.[83] The Los Angeles Times said the disappointing box office performances of non-franchise films Edge of Tomorrow and Blended, both produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, indicated risky investments by the studio, which had better success earlier in the year with franchise films The Lego Movie and Godzilla (2014).[84]\n\n#### Subsequent weekends\n\nIn its second weekend of release in North America (June 13–15, 2014), Edge of Tomorrow had a \"light\" second-weekend drop of 43% due to word of mouth and grossed $16.5 million on the second weekend.[85] In the same weekend in territories outside North America, the film was on 14,725 screens. With approximately 5.1 million admissions, it grossed $37.3 million. China, Russia, and South Korea, respectively, had the film's largest weekend grosses among the territories.[86] In South Korea, the film ranked first at the box office for two consecutive weekends, grossing a total of $25.65 million by June 17, 2014.[87]\n\nIn Japan, Edge of Tomorrow was released on July 4, 2014, under the light novel's title All You Need Is Kill.[88] The film opened second in the weekend rankings behind Maleficent, with an intake of $4.5 million.[89] As of November 30, 2014[update], with $15.3 million, Edge of Tomorrow is the sixth-highest-grossing foreign movie of the year in Japan, and the 21st overall.[90]\n\n### Home media\n\nEdge of Tomorrow was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and video on demand in the United States on October 7, 2014. The Blu-ray includes over 90 minutes of bonus features.[59] The home release's packaging downplays the original Edge of Tomorrow title in favor of placing more prominence on the film's original tagline, \"Live. Die. Repeat.\" Media critics believed that the re-branding was an attempt by Warner Bros. to re-launch the film's marketing following its lackluster U.S. box office performance. Posters for the film's theatrical release had similarly placed a larger emphasis on the \"Live. Die. Repeat.\" tagline than the actual title of the film.[6][91] Similarly, some digital retailers listed the film under the title Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow.[6] The film ranked first in home media sales for the week beginning October 7, with 62% of sales coming from the Blu-ray version.[92] The DVD and Blu-ray releases grossed $27.9 million in the United States.[2] On July 5, 2022, Edge of Tomorrow was released on 4K Blu-ray.[93]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nEdge of Tomorrow received largely positive reviews from critics,[94] who praised the humor, Liman's direction, the aliens' design, Cruise and Blunt's performances, and the time-loop premise's ability to remain fresh. However, some critics had issues with the film's conclusion.[95] Based on 335 reviews, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Gripping, well-acted, funny, and clever, Edge of Tomorrow offers entertaining proof that Tom Cruise is still more than capable of shouldering the weight of a blockbuster action thriller.\"[96] On another aggregator, Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[97] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[98]\n\nJustin Chang of Variety called Edge of Tomorrow \"a cleverly crafted and propulsively executed sci-fi thriller\", saying that the film was director Doug Liman's best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said that the screenwriters, with the assistance of the editors, \"tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience\". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt's characters, Chang said \"Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole.\" He also commended the visual effects of the \"expertly designed Mimics\" as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography.[99]\n\nTodd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, said the film was \"a narratively ambitious sci-fi actioner\" that \"takes a relatively playful attitude toward the familiar battle tropes\". McCarthy said that, despite the humor, he found the time loop premise \"tedious\" and that \"the final stretch becomes dramatically unconvincing and visually murky\". However, he also called the effects \"exciting, convincing and gritty\" and applauded Gleeson and Paxton in their supporting roles.[100] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, considering the film \"a star-driven mass-market entertainment that's smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions\" that broke a string of \"cookie-cutter, been-there blockbusters\".[101]\n\nEdge of Tomorrow was listed on 23 critics' top ten lists of movies of 2014 (out of 201 evaluated).[102]\n\nDavid Hynes of WhatCulture ranked Dante Harper's original script, All You Need Is Kill (2010), fifth in a list of the \"10 Best Movie Screenplays Since 2010\", considering certain changes made for the film to be detrimental: \"Is it me or does [the title Edge of Tomorrow] suck in comparison? [...] The conflict between Cage and the Mimics is also far more localised to the beach and marine barracks in the screenplay which improves the cohesiveness of the overall story, whereas Cruise finds himself up in a helicopter in no time in the film version.\"[103]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                     | Date of ceremony    | Category

Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Blunt said of her role, \"In these male-fueled genres, it's usually the woman who's holding the hand of the guy and he's running through explosions leading her, and I wanted to be doing the leading.\"[123] Chris Nashawaty, reviewing the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it \"the most feminist summer action flick in years\".[124] Bustle's Alicia Lutes described Rita as \"ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens\" and said: \"This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling.\" Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as \"she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again.\"[125] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about \"strong female characters\" that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that \"the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her\".[126]\n\nIn contrast, The Wire's Esther Zuckerman criticized the inclusion of a romantic relationship in the film, and said of the two characters' kiss: \"There's a case to be made that the kiss is simply an acceptance of their fate, but everything we know about Rita up until this point implies that she's a dedicated soldier, and making her a sudden romantic betrays her character.\" Zuckerman added: \"That's not to say she can't soften up a bit as humans do, but the moment reads less like she's accepting her humanity and more like the filmmakers had to acknowledge two attractive leads ... who should lock lips because that's what men and women do in movies.\"[127] Writing in The Week, Monika Bartyzel also criticized the romance in the film, stating that Rita is the one who kisses Cage, despite knowing him for only a day where he had known her for multiple days via time loop. Bartyzel said that Rita's portrayal was part of a commonly seen motif in which a female character helps a male \"Chosen One\" character and that this was \"the new normal because it allows Hollywood to appeal to feminist concerns while continuing to feed male wish fulfillment\". Bartyzel said that Rita \"at her most powerful\" ultimately serves \"to make the male hero into a fighter like herself\".[128]\n\n### Comparison to video games\n\nLiman said that the film's repeated scenes intentionally paralleled the respawning feature in video games, where players have to start over on a level if their character dies.[51] In the afterword of All You Need Is Kill, author Hiroshi Sakurazaka notes his experience playing video games as a source of inspiration while writing the novel.[129] Salon's Ryan Leas said analyses of the film noted that it \"steals from the video game genre\". Leas called Edge of Tomorrow's looped action \"a meta-commentary on the blockbuster genre\", saying: \"It's a blockbuster interested in the question of how mind-numbing its genre has become to its viewers.\"[130] Comparing Edge of Tomorrow to film adaptations of video games, Wired's Angela Watercutter said Liman's film was more successful for basing itself on the medium's narrative structure, and for its \"ability to continue after 'Game Over' and discover something new\".[131]\n\n## Future\n\n### Possible sequel\n\nIn a December 2015 interview with Collider, McQuarrie said that Cruise had an idea for a sequel, and that the concept is \"locked and loaded.\"[132] In April 2016, Doug Liman had signed on to direct the sequel, while Race screenwriters Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse will write the script for the film.[133] In October 2016, Liman stated that the film would \"revolutionize how people make sequels\", and went on to say that the story is \"much better than the original film\" and that it is \"a sequel that's a prequel.\"[134][135] In May 2017, Liman revealed that the title will be Live Die Repeat and Repeat and that both Cruise and Emily Blunt will reprise their roles from the first film.[136] In January 2018, Liman said that Live Die Repeat and Repeat could be his next film and that scheduling issues have been worked out and the film is moving steadily toward a window in which to start production.[137] In March 2018, Liman said that he was now working with Jez Butterworth on a script rewrite for the film.[138] Later that month, Blunt stated that she, Cruise and Liman were all enthusiastic about the project, but also noted that \"It's a lot for all the stars to align for everyone to be free at the same time and available to do it at the same time.\"[139] In March 2019, it was reported that Matthew Robinson would rewrite the screenplay,[140] and in October, Liman confirmed that the script was finished.[141]\n\nAfter numerous delays, Liman said on Instagram that the project was still in \"planning stages\" as of January 2020.[142] In January 2021, Liman continued to suggest a sequel will eventually happen and merely needs the two stars to pull the trigger.[143] Emily Blunt has since stated that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the budget for another film would be \"too expensive\", casting further doubt on a possible sequel.[144] In June 2023, Blunt reiterated her interest in a returning for a sequel, but said she does not know when it would happen.[145] That month, McQuarrie said that getting the sequel produced had been a complicated situation thus far.[146] In August 2023, Blunt stated that Cruise's busy schedule was preventing production from moving forward.[147]\n\nIn January 2024, following a contractual partnership between Cruise and Warner Bros. Pictures, it was revealed that the actor will develop and appear in various projects from the studio. It was stated that co-heads/co-chairpeople Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy had been in negotiations with Tom Cruise to develop an Edge of Tomorrow sequel following the project's many delays.[148] They discussed a potential sequel at a meeting that month.[149]\n\n### Television series\n\nIn February 2022, it was revealed by Village Roadshow Pictures that Warner Bros. Pictures had been developing a television series spin-off of the film with intentions to release the show exclusively on HBO Max.[150]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films featuring time loops\n- List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n- List of science fiction films of the 2010s\n- The Defence of Duffer's Drift, a 1904 short book with a similar premise\n- \"Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat\", a 2019 television episode named after the film\n\n## References\n\n### Notes\n\n- ^ Later marketed as Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow[6]\n\n### Citations\n\n- ^ a b c d e Adams, Mark (May 22, 2014). \"Edge of Tomorrow | Reviews\".

Starring <Name>Tom Cruise</Name> and <Name>Emily Blunt</Name>, the film takes place in a future where most of Europe is occupied by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a public relations officer with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a landing operation against the aliens, only to find himself experiencing a time loop as he tries to find a way to defeat the invaders. Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson also appear in supporting roles.\n\nIn late 2009, 3 Arts Entertainment purchased the rights to All You Need Is Kill and sold the spec script to Warner Bros. Pictures. The studio produced Edge of Tomorrow with the involvement of 3 Arts, the novel's publisher Viz Media, and Australian production company Village Roadshow. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden, outside London, and other locations, such as London's Trafalgar Square and the coastal Saunton Sands. A total of nine companies handled the visual effects.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow was released theatrically in select territories on May 30, 2014, and in the United States on June 6, 2014. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the plot, direction, action sequences, and performances. It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run. Since then, it has been considered one of the best action films of the 2010s.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2015, an alien race known as \"Mimics\" lands in Germany and swiftly conquers much of continental Europe, killing millions. By 2020, humanity has formed a global military alliance, the United Defense Force (UDF), to combat the Mimics. However, victory remained elusive until the recent Battle of Verdun, which was secured by the celebrated war hero Sergeant Rita Vrataski.\n\nIn Britain, the UDF masses forces for a major invasion of France. General Brigham orders public affairs officer Major William Cage to cover the offensive from the frontline, but the inexperienced and cowardly Cage attempts to blackmail Brigham into rescinding the order. Brigham has Cage arrested, demoted to Private and sent to the military base at Heathrow Airport to join the invasion as infantry. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, who dislike and belittle him. The following day, the invasion forces land on a French beach but are ambushed and massacred by Mimics. Cage uses a Claymore mine to kill a larger \"Alpha\" Mimic, becoming covered in its blood and mortally wounding himself in the ensuing explosion.\n\nCage suddenly awakens at Heathrow, finding he is reliving the previous morning. He makes failed attempts to warn against the invasion and experiences multiple loops in which he dies on the beach and awakens at Heathrow, his battlefield knowledge and skills increasing with each loop. He tries to save Vrataski's life so she can lead them but, after recognizing his apparent prescience, she allows herself to die, ordering Cage to find her on his next loop.\n\nCage quickly convinces Vrataski of the reset because she gained the same power after exposure to an Alpha's blood. Her loops enabled her, an initially inexperienced soldier, to win at Verdun, but a later blood transfusion removed the power. Vrataski takes Cage to Mimic expert Dr. Carter, who explains the creatures are a superorganism controlled by a single, gigantic \"Omega\" Mimic. Whenever the Alpha Mimics are killed, the Omega restarts a loop and adjusts its tactics until the Mimics win. Vrataski realizes the Mimics allowed the UDF victory at Verdun to make them overconfident in their new mech-suits and lure them into overcommitting their forces in retaking Europe, allowing the Mimics to exterminate most of the resistance.\n\nCage spends many loops training with Vrataski so they can reach the Omega, but he begins to care for her and struggles after seeing her repeatedly die. He experiences a vision of the Omega concealed in a German dam, and he and Vrataski seek it out. During the journey, the pair bond, but Vrataski remains distant, having seen someone she cared about die hundreds of times at Verdun. She eventually determines that this is not the first loop in which they approached the Omega. Cage reveals that she always dies before reaching the dam, regardless of his actions, and he is unwilling to kill the Omega and end the loops if she will remain dead. Upset, Vrataski attempts to leave but is killed by a Mimic. Despondent, during the next loop, Cage travels to the dam alone. He learns the vision was a trap and is ambushed by an Alpha, but Cage drowns before it can remove his power.\n\nTo find the Omega, Cage and Vrataski sneak into General Brigham's office and pressure him into handing over a prototype transponder designed by Carter. Having used it to locate the Omega beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, Cage is knocked unconscious during their escape and given a blood transfusion for his injuries, removing his power.\n\nVrataski frees Cage, and he uses his detailed knowledge of J-Squad to convince them to help destroy the Omega. They fly to Paris, where the squad members sacrifice themselves to ensure Cage and Vrataski reach the Louvre. Cornered by an Alpha, Vrataski kisses Cage, lamenting that she does not have more time to get to know him. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he drops several grenades that destroy the Omega and bathe him in its blood.\n\nCage awakens before his first meeting with General Brigham, and witnesses a news announcement that all Mimics are dead following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage returns to Heathrow and finds Vrataski. Oblivious to his identity, she inquires what he wants; Cage chuckles.\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information about \"Edge of Tomorrow\" according to the specified attributes, ensuring clarity and readability while maintaining the original content's integrity.",

MarVista Entertainment releases the film in select theaters on Friday, May 19.\n\nWhen a loved one battles addiction, you often find yourself in the midst of conflicting responsibilities. There’s the responsibility you have to the loved one, to monitor and support them; the responsibility you have to others in their orbit, to share in the caretaking and not saddle any one person with a burden; and, perhaps most troublesomely, there’s the responsibility you have to yourself, to make space for the life you desire and deserve.\n\nThe tricky business of balancing — and sometimes, prioritizing between — these concerns is central to Jamie Sisley’s “Stay Awake,” a sensitive if not especially insightful family drama that follows two brothers in small-town Virginia serving as pillars of support for their mother, who is addicted to prescription drugs.\n\nRelated Stories Steven Soderbergh Is Considering the ‘Plastic in Our Blood’ as a Way Into Another ‘Contagion’ Film Julia Stiles Recalls Harvey Weinstein Making Her Feel ‘So Slimy’ During Unnecessary Reshoots for ‘Down to You’\n\nThe indie addiction melodrama is familiar territory, and many stories that deal with the topic conform to a certain repetitive structure: an emergency, an attempt to detox, a relapse. The driving mood is hope — hope that this time will be different, this time sobriety will stick. Constructing movies this way is understandable: It encapsulates the actual experience of loving an addict. But the issue with this approach is that the movie hangs on a kind of suspense: Will she follow through or won’t she? There’s something icky about treating addiction as an engine for narrative tension, even if the anxieties are true to life.\n\nThis is a difficult trap to avoid, and Sisley, who wrote and directed “Stay Awake” as his feature debut, isn’t always successful. He finds the best flow zeroing in on the dynamic between the two brothers: the younger, sensitive Ethan (Wyatt Oleff) and the elder Derek (Fin Argus), a charming jokester. We meet Ethan during his senior year of high school, and he spends his days collecting A’s in English class and his afternoons working at an ice cream shop. Nights, however, are often taken up by a different activity: hauling his “Ma,” Michelle (Chrissy Metz, best known for “This Is Us”), to the hospital for emergency treatment.\n\nEthan shares this duty with Derek, who works at the town bowling alley and aspires to a career in acting, though the only gigs he can score locally are for silly television commercials. Derek might have a shot at stardom if he only had the nerve to jet off to a bigger city — but then who would keep Ma from passing out as they speed to the emergency room? Ethan’s in a similar boat. Early on in the film, he learns that he’s scored a full ride to Brown University, as well as an acceptance to a local tech school. He faces a choice: Should he set out for the Ivy League and unload Ma on Derek, or defer his dreams to stay close to home?\n\nOverall, “Stay Awake” unfolds as a modest and rather straightforward melodrama. Sisley establishes the smallness of his townie setting by repeatedly shooting in only a few locations, one of them being the turn-in for the doctor whose injudicious prescriptions fuel Michelle’s addiction. Indoor scenes, like at the bowling alley or in the family living room, are almost exclusively rendered in dim, handsome lighting and shallow focus, and most scenes are shot with a steadicam. It’s a well-worn indie aesthetic — one that, in its stock familiarity, actually serves to make each scene feel less naturalistic.\n\nAny psychological complexity comes from the movie’s focus on the brothers. By opting to highlight their experiences, Sisley illustrates a key truth about addiction: It doesn’t only affect one person, but sucks everyone around into its vortex. We learn early on that Michelle isn’t the only one who needs recovery; Ethan and Derek have been so focused on their Ma that they’ve surrendered their own ambitions. By focusing the story on the pivotal moment of Ethan’s graduation, Sisley traces the boys’ recovery of their will to independence. In this way, the movie almost becomes a test: For Ethan and Derek, what does the last straw look like? What will inspire them to prioritize their responsibility to themselves over that to Michelle?\n\nYet in tilting toward the brothers’ story, the movie fails to offer a sense of Michelle’s plight. Much of the time, she feels more like an enigma than a fleshed out character, and though Metz does her best to find warmth and fragility in the material she’s given, there’s little room for her to develop, or for the audience to develop sympathy for her state. Despite a few solo scenes, the meatiest of which occurs opposite a psychologist at a rehab center, Michelle’s thought processes — or even how inclined or disinclined she is toward treatment — remain out of focus.\n\nConfusion also lingers about the doctor prescribing Michelle the pills. In the only scene inside the doctor’s office, Michelle seems to dupe him into writing a prescription by giving him a urine sample tainted with a drop of blood from her pricked finger. Sisley never spells out what drug Michelle is using, but blood in one’s urine wouldn’t call for anything other than an antibiotic. Is Michelle paying the doctor under the table for a controlled substance? What exactly is their agreement? These questions go unanswered, and the lack of specificity only swells the distracting empty space where Michelle’s individual struggles could have gone.\n\n“Stay Awake” is an expansion of Sisley’s short film of the same name, and it is based on his personal experiences with his own mother. It’s an earnest look at the collateral damage surrounding addiction, and the movie is at its strongest when it homes in on the experiences of Ethan and Derek. But as the main characters of the movie learn, compassion alone isn’t always enough.\n\n### Grade: C\n\n“Stay Awake” premiered at the 2022 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nRead More:\n\n- Berlin\n- Film\n- Reviews\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo Birds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

MarVista Entertainment releases the film in select theaters on Friday, May 19.\n\nWhen a loved one battles addiction, you often find yourself in the midst of conflicting responsibilities. There’s the responsibility you have to the loved one, to monitor and support them; the responsibility you have to others in their orbit, to share in the caretaking and not saddle any one person with a burden; and, perhaps most troublesomely, there’s the responsibility you have to yourself, to make space for the life you desire and deserve.\n\nThe tricky business of balancing — and sometimes, prioritizing between — these concerns is central to Jamie Sisley’s “Stay Awake,” a sensitive if not especially insightful family drama that follows two brothers in small-town Virginia serving as pillars of support for their mother, who is addicted to prescription drugs.\n\nRelated Stories Steven Soderbergh Is Considering the ‘Plastic in Our Blood’ as a Way Into Another ‘Contagion’ Film Julia Stiles Recalls Harvey Weinstein Making Her Feel ‘So Slimy’ During Unnecessary Reshoots for ‘Down to You’\n\nThe indie addiction melodrama is familiar territory, and many stories that deal with the topic conform to a certain repetitive structure: an emergency, an attempt to detox, a relapse. The driving mood is hope — hope that this time will be different, this time sobriety will stick. Constructing movies this way is understandable: It encapsulates the actual experience of loving an addict. But the issue with this approach is that the movie hangs on a kind of suspense: Will she follow through or won’t she? There’s something icky about treating addiction as an engine for narrative tension, even if the anxieties are true to life.\n\nThis is a difficult trap to avoid, and Sisley, who wrote and directed “Stay Awake” as his feature debut, isn’t always successful. He finds the best flow zeroing in on the dynamic between the two brothers: the younger, sensitive Ethan (Wyatt Oleff) and the elder Derek (Fin Argus), a charming jokester. We meet Ethan during his senior year of high school, and he spends his days collecting A’s in English class and his afternoons working at an ice cream shop. Nights, however, are often taken up by a different activity: hauling his “Ma,” Michelle (Chrissy Metz, best known for “This Is Us”), to the hospital for emergency treatment.\n\nEthan shares this duty with Derek, who works at the town bowling alley and aspires to a career in acting, though the only gigs he can score locally are for silly television commercials. Derek might have a shot at stardom if he only had the nerve to jet off to a bigger city — but then who would keep Ma from passing out as they speed to the emergency room? Ethan’s in a similar boat. Early on in the film, he learns that he’s scored a full ride to Brown University, as well as an acceptance to a local tech school. He faces a choice: Should he set out for the Ivy League and unload Ma on Derek, or defer his dreams to stay close to home?\n\nOverall, “Stay Awake” unfolds as a modest and rather straightforward melodrama. Sisley establishes the smallness of his townie setting by repeatedly shooting in only a few locations, one of them being the turn-in for the doctor whose injudicious prescriptions fuel Michelle’s addiction. Indoor scenes, like at the bowling alley or in the family living room, are almost exclusively rendered in dim, handsome lighting and shallow focus, and most scenes are shot with a steadicam. It’s a well-worn indie aesthetic — one that, in its stock familiarity, actually serves to make each scene feel less naturalistic.\n\nAny psychological complexity comes from the movie’s focus on the brothers. By opting to highlight their experiences, Sisley illustrates a key truth about addiction: It doesn’t only affect one person, but sucks everyone around into its vortex. We learn early on that Michelle isn’t the only one who needs recovery; Ethan and Derek have been so focused on their Ma that they’ve surrendered their own ambitions. By focusing the story on the pivotal moment of Ethan’s graduation, Sisley traces the boys’ recovery of their will to independence. In this way, the movie almost becomes a test: For Ethan and Derek, what does the last straw look like? What will inspire them to prioritize their responsibility to themselves over that to Michelle?\n\nYet in tilting toward the brothers’ story, the movie fails to offer a sense of Michelle’s plight. Much of the time, she feels more like an enigma than a fleshed out character, and though Metz does her best to find warmth and fragility in the material she’s given, there’s little room for her to develop, or for the audience to develop sympathy for her state. Despite a few solo scenes, the meatiest of which occurs opposite a psychologist at a rehab center, Michelle’s thought processes — or even how inclined or disinclined she is toward treatment — remain out of focus.\n\nConfusion also lingers about the doctor prescribing Michelle the pills. In the only scene inside the doctor’s office, Michelle seems to dupe him into writing a prescription by giving him a urine sample tainted with a drop of blood from her pricked finger. Sisley never spells out what drug Michelle is using, but blood in one’s urine wouldn’t call for anything other than an antibiotic. Is Michelle paying the doctor under the table for a controlled substance? What exactly is their agreement? These questions go unanswered, and the lack of specificity only swells the distracting empty space where Michelle’s individual struggles could have gone.\n\n“Stay Awake” is an expansion of Sisley’s short film of the same name, and it is based on his personal experiences with his own mother. It’s an earnest look at the collateral damage surrounding addiction, and the movie is at its strongest when it homes in on the experiences of Ethan and Derek. But as the main characters of the movie learn, compassion alone isn’t always enough.\n\n### Grade: C\n\n“Stay Awake” premiered at the 2022 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nRead More:\n\n- Berlin\n- Film\n- Reviews\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGo Birds\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSXSW\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

I mean they've managed to take an issue about many things - youth, poverty, society, mentality, anger - and turn it into nothing more than the documentation of some black kid being killed.\n\nMy first issue is with the narration. Why is it there? He's dead. Is he talking to us from beyond the grave? If so, he's got a pretty muted perspective on things - I mean you would think he'd have more to say concerning his current state than simply who he is and what happened to him. WE ALREADY KNOW. And if we don't we get to know through watching the actual film playing before our very faces. You can't just DO narration, not anymore. It needs to be within some sort of context. If he's so desperate to tell his story that he must travel to this plane of reality and narrate a film then more needs to be said beyond the painfully obvious. Trite things like this sap a film's intrigue and disengage the audience. \n\nMy second issue is with the characterisations. An 18 year old kid who goes out of his way to kill a 15 year old, who may or may not be seeing his girlfriend (the 15 year old kid who definitely didn't know she wasn't single), is BROKEN. He is not an evil, brooding antagonist, he's insane in the membrane and that needs to be addressed ... and if he just so happens not to be, then THAT needs to be addressed; the fact that he's grown into that way of thinking. The point that's clearly being missed in all of this is that there's a \"Shakilus Townsend\" case almost every other week. It happens WAY too often to just be turned into a 'simple-Simon' murder story, since it's made obvious to be a much bigger issue than that. It's shrunken when you treat a character like Danny's so broad and generically.\n\nUltimately, watching this film, you get the sense that all the research done prior to making it was in the reading of THE SUN's article (\"Honey trap girl is found guilty\"). I mean it's almost as if they didn't actually talk to the Mother. We know no more than we already did and that's really strange when you not only have the Mother on hand but all seven of the convicted caught and locked up. I'm certain none of THOSE kids were approached during the making of this film - how laughably amateur!\n\nThis was the one chance to enlighten an audience of angry, narrow minded Brits repulsed by gang culture, so that we don't continue to ignoring or even try to blitz it but embrace and attempt to fix it.\n\nVery lazy filmmaking and the poor treatment of a case like this. Shakilus Townsend and many other murdered black, British teenagers deserve better.\n\n- csuperman\n- Apr 8, 2012\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - March 26, 2012 (United Kingdom)\n- Country of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n- Language\n    - English\n- Production company\n    - British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour\n- Color\n    - Color\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Or of the reason why they did it. The discourse on parenting is precisely the film's pivotal element, and it is carried out gracefully. The Quite Girl is not an original film, or particularly entertaining, but it succeeds in offering a perfectly constructed story from beginning to end. It certainly conveys a great love for cinema and its language, this in the attention and subtle use of detail, in the beautiful cinematography and in the image construction. An outstanding piece of work indeed.\n\n- beatrice\\_gangi\n- Jan 2, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ18\n\n- How long is The Quiet Girl?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 13, 2022 (Ireland)\n- Country of origin\n    - Ireland\n- Official site\n    - Screen Ireland site for film\n- Languages\n    - Irish Gaelic\n    - English\n    - Gaelic\n- Also known as\n    - La Niña Callada\n- Filming locations\n    - Moynalvey, County Meath, Ireland\n- Production companies\n    - Inscéal\n    - Broadcasting Authority of Ireland\n    - Fís Éireann / Screen Ireland\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $1,500,014\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $59,149\n    - Feb 26, 2023\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $6,785,404\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 35 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.37 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Hindi language plot outline for The Quiet Girl (2022)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An eerie motel occupied by eccentric and troubled guests, and a spooky, single-night story reliant on the female protagonist’s anxiety and paranoia. It’s understandable if more selective audiences would rather check out than stay. However safe brothers Benjamin and Paul China play their first co-directed feature, they also incidentally create a strange amount of comfort for certain viewers like myself. This movie engenders nostalgia for a bygone era of routine horror followed by a bizarre twist.\n\nAs promised by the movie’s title, Phoebe Tonkin‘s character Gwen goes to work once the sun goes down. All Tucked Inn’s owner, Lamorne Morris‘ Teddy, has left everything in Gwen’s care so he can go on a date one evening. And like clockwork, the novice employee succumbs to the isolated location’s creepiness over the course of the night. Gwen’s terror is straightforward enough — weird sounds, ominous phone ringing, moving shadows — but everything changes once she becomes curious about Room 13, the one unit that’s been discounted on account of superstition.\n\nThe motel room in question naturally sticks with you while trying to figure out the overall mystery. Is the place haunted or not? The China Brothers do a solid job of keeping you on that path; they even convince you that maybe All Tucked Inn has a supernatural effect on its guests. The late arrival of one memorably unhinged and stuck-up couple, played to the max by Patrick Fischler and Lauren Bowles, are proof enough of the roadside lodging being a hub of uncanny energy. The story eventually veers off course, and that decision is welcome. The new route isn’t any less paved with clichés, but it helps keep an already engaged audience on the hook. Night Shift‘s foreseeability notwithstanding, the movie is good at building suspense and maintaining intrigue.\n\nWhile not a guaranteed dealbreaker for less desensitized horror enthusiasts, Night Shift‘s lack of creative scares will undoubtedly be seen as a demerit for those more seasoned fans. Gwen and the motel’s only other guest, a runaway played by Madison Hu, endure the whole of these so-so fright sequences, such as being locked in the supply closet that Teddy explicitly mentioned earlier. There are also plenty of moments where something spooky happens behind Gwen’s back. The set-pieces don’t deliver noteworthy shocks and spills, although they do keep the energy up as well as fight the inevitable monotony inherent to one-location stories.\n\nThese days in horror, there is more to consider than complete originality. And while the China Brothers’ dependency on hoary tropes can be seen as a hindrance, they also use that predictability to their advantage. Just when you are complacent and ready to write this one off as too conventional, the movie hurls a seismic revelation at you. This development is more organic than first realized; there are clues, in retrospect. Again, novelty is nonexistent, but this specific kind of plot curveball should please fans of early-2000s horror. That narrative shift qualifies at least one visit to the All Tucked Inn.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Twitter\n- Facebook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Published by Paul Lê\n\nI'm Paul Lê.

There was an air of innocence to Aniston's 'Justine' or 'Tine,' as John C. Reilly's character lovingly refers to her, and to the story that unfolds.\n\nHowever as the credits rolled my mind did a reassessment on how the story unfolded. I couldn't help feeling that Justine was more responsible for the tragic events that occur than I did the first time viewing. I felt that she possessed certain attributes that resembled the noir-ish femme fatale archetype - or at least some of the key characteristics; and that the film itself presents conventions that are often seen in noir films. \"The goadings of the traitorous, femme fatale would lead the struggling, disillusioned, and doomed' hero into committing murder or some other crime of passion coupled with twisted love.\"\n\nJustine is presented to us as someone who has life within her, dreams, hopes, a desire to explore, and all of those around her at home and at work lack any dimension and depth. Her voice overs guide us, and allow us to feel empathy for a young woman stuck living in a situation that has her hemmed in. They also expose how she isn't convinced or cocksure in what she wants as we initially think, or she initially thinks.\n\nHer marriage to John C. Reilly's character is quite pathetic, and sad. Although heart-warming, in a very childlike and naive way. She is constantly mithering him to stop smoking weed with his weird and unintelligent colleague and best friend (played by Tim Blake Nelson), to fix appliances around the house. She clearly has no real attraction to him, and harbours resentment, however subtlety, for the fact that he's impotent/lacking in the same 'goodness' she is drawn to. She appears to have a sympathetic surface level bond with her husband much like one could compare to that of a small child with the family dog, as she says \"He's a pig, he talks but he doesn't think\" and it is apparent that she needs more stimulation than he can provide. Their relationship regardless of how quaint, isn't rooted in the passion or complexity she clearly seeks, what her heart yearns for. Or at least what she thinks she yearns for.\n\nAll the signals are there in the beginning. She is stuck in her dead end marriage, in a dead end job, surrounded by people with depth but who possess a great level of pleasantness and good will. She meets a young man, who is clearly socially inept and troubled. But who has the complexity and inward turmoil she has too. He declares his drinking problem, his issues with his family and mental health very early on in their first encounter. He visibly has no assets, no prospects, living under his parents dead gaze with little rational plans to enact to make it as a writer. Yet she still pursues the damaged Holden, leads a short lived, intense (and reciprocated) love affair with him whilst weighing up if what she bargained for is really the direction she wants to take. Simultaneously feeling guilty and wishing to repent for her sins at bible study with her oblivious cuckhold husband who she goes to extra lengths to keep in the dark for. Narrowly avoiding the worker who works at the hotel, through manipulation, managing to evade a confrontation with the aforementioned who could've rumbled that she's been performing sexual deeds with a younger man, and sleeping with her husband's best friend to boot.\n\nEventually all unravels, as she has second thoughts on her way out, meditates on her perceived path to aliveness, her way out of the mundane: Holden. Becoming slowly aware of his youthful, wilful self-annihilation, and lack of direction. She becomes concerned by his death drive and alerts the authorities and makes the conscious choice to go back to a flat, placid life with a man she lacks a morsel of veneration for - a life she has vehemently condemned time and time again. Becoming pregnant with the young man's child. She opts to remain in a stilted marriage, one which always invariably breeds contempt, setting up her child to be raised in the same type of dynamic is her lover Holden, who resorts to suicide in attempt to escape the agonising pain that he already felt in his life prior to Justine, but was made worse after being given the hope of escape from said pain via Justine's reciprocal infatuation with him. Justine clearly craved the Sturm und Drang that came with Holden, and despite his tragic end being foreshadowed, came to realise that her desires were just that, fantasies, and that real life can bring you to a dead end regardless of the attempts one can make to create various open ended avenues.\n\nSome people say, it's better to have loved than lost, than to have never have loved at all. And I'd disagree, for people like Holden, brittle, sensitive, anguished souls like him, the hope that is given in such an ecstatic experience to only be brought to an end in such a way only fast-forwards the process to destruction. Justine could have avoided this end, whilst he would have always lived a life full of inner conflict, he may have not been so psychologically contorted and left the world so early before seeing the birth of his child.\n\nWhilst it's easy to say, Justine has good intentions, that she was a \"good girl\" at heart - she was unknowingly a catalyst for more trouble in her own life and the lives of those around her. Perhaps the message communicated was that whilst all of us think that we are good people, with good intentions, we unconsciously, inevitably, hurt people and cause a chain of events that slowly become hard to contain or control.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of February 9, 2017\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of February 2017\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2017\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

Right?\n\nDirected and written by Steven Basilone in his feature debut, Long Weekend opens with Bart in total shambles. Alone, depressed, and seemingly medicated, Bart has no idea how to pick up the pieces of his life after losing his mother to cancer, his career to corporate interests, and his fiancé to dramatic circumstances. At what might be his lowest moment, he encounters Vienna in a movie theater of all places, and thus their bond over all things film and irony begins to blossom.\n\nThe problem is that Vienna is suspiciously private about all the major details of her background. She won’t talk about where she came from, why she’s in LA, or why she conspicuously lacks a phone. Regardless, Bart finds himself utterly smitten with her, and the two strike up a passionate, short-term fling. Her secret, which is best kept as a surprise if you can help it, certainly upends the film’s grounded, Sundance-flavored tone, but none of the romance anguishes under the pressure of such a dramatic story reversal. If anything, it infuses this otherwise dull romantic dramedy with a unique angle worth falling for.\n\nMost of Long Weekend is spent in endearing isolation with both Bart and Vienna. Their chemistry works well because of how relatably awkward it is — they both share a common love of witty sarcasm and meta-jokes about their personal hang ups. They relate their individual stories to movies quite a bit, even for millennials in Los Angeles. And as their bond deepens, so too does the tragic nature of their brief time together.\n\nThe film introduces a lot of heady concepts about the machinations of destiny and finding the right person at the wrong time, but it never unravels these points into anything substantive or cerebral. Long Weekend runs on pure emotion. It’s more about how these characters can possibly cope with a world that feels doomed — whether it be from climate change or the perils of disease — rather than what they really think about these issues and their wider implications.\n\nAt times, Long Weekend tries to play a magic trick on the audience, distracting them from its unbalanced premise by allowing its leads to exert charm practically through the screen. But the holes in the narrative reappear as soon as the supporting cast gets time to factually address the absurdity of their situation, notably Damon Wayans Jr. as Doug, Bart’s “why don’t you just settle down, already” type best friend. It’s certainly a welcome change to see Wayans Jr. in a subtler, more nuanced role than usual, though the film underutilizes its billing of Wendi McLendon-Covey as Bart’s flirty landlord and Jim Rash as a dog-obsessed boss (don’t get ahead of yourselves, “Community” fans), who only appear in two scenes for reasons that demand an investigation.\n\nBy the final stretch, almost anyone who’s seen a single romantic comedy or drama will be able pinpoint all the exact beats and revelations at least 20 minutes before the film  finally cut to credits. Long Weekend isn’t a long movie by any means, just 91 minutes. But its main issue is that it soldiers on with its story quite a while after the meat of its plot has lost steam, as much of the third act is a waiting game for Long Weekend to finally hit its expected destination. In fact, it’s hard not to wonder if the film’s core twist might’ve worked better as a huge reveal closer to the end.\n\nBut again, it’s hard to tear down a film this earnest and competent where it counts the most: the romance. Wittrock and Chao are undeniably well-cast here, capable of turning pretentious dialogue and an onslaught of niche pop culture references into relatable, human conversation. You can feel how strongly their words are trying to reach the other person, and it’s mostly done through the sheer dynamism of these performances, specifically with how their expressions tend to communicate everything they’re feeling before they’ve uttered a single word. It’s the sort of soft, but potent emotional connection Basilone pulled off quite well with his work on “Community” and “The Goldbergs,” proving his material works best when in the hands of actors who can balance comedy and heart almost effortlessly.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nLong Weekend is being released by Stage 6 films in theaters starting March 12.\n\n- Author\n- Recent Posts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJon Negroni is an author and Film/TV critic currently residing in the Bay Area for reasons not even he understands.

This imaginary comparison is often between the archetype and a living character, an object that is immediately present or a thing that is quite popular. Even some examples of such archetypes have appeared in the movies and have become popular. Some of the best archetype examples from movies are as follow.Example #1Everyman ArchetypeThese types of archetypes are often orphans, common individuals, or persons. In such cases, this type of archetype demonstrates a real picture of a person who seems similar to it. Such archetype examples are solidly virtuous, innocent, and realist. They do not pretend or show pretentions. They accept others, honor them and behave in a dignified manner, seem friendly and fair in dealings, and show understanding in relations. They continue enjoying the simple life, demonstrating all common values of loyalty, faith, and hope. Some of these examples are as follows.George Bailey in It’s a Wonderful LifeBenjamin “Ben” McKenna in The Man Who Knew Too MuchFrodo Baggins in The Lord of the RingsHuck Finn in Huckleberry FinnExample #2Innocent  ArchetypeSuch archetypes are not only mystics and dreamers but are often romantic and even naïve. They demonstrate their optimism, natural goodness, and faith in God with simplicity in manners. As they are pure, showing purity of life and virtue, they often demonstrate positivism, hope, and optimism. Strong personal values drive their life toward blissfulness. They have human features of love, faith, and loyalty. Some of the innocent archetype examples are as follows.Forrest Gump in the Forrest GumpDorothy in The Wizard of OzAlice in Alice in WonderlandExample #3Hero ArchetypeHero archetype includes all types of heroes such as a soldier, tribal chief, just ruler, warrior, crusader, dragon slayer, deliverer, or even a superhero. A classical hero delivers justice to his/her people, while a just ruler, too, delivers justice. However, a superhero surmounts all types of obstacles to save his nation or tribe. Such heroes even resort to violence for a just cause. The major character traits of such heroes are wisdom, strategic thinking, courage, boldness, determination, flexibility, resilience, daredevil type of nature with the mental power to plan, advance, and retreat. Some of the best hero archetypes are as follows.William Wallace in BraveheartLuke Skywalker in Star WarsOdysseus in the Odyssey movieMaximus in GladiatorExample #4Child ArchetypeChild archetypes appear in various movies, making people identify them with other such characters around them, write about them or write characters like them. The main features of such archetypes are that a child appearing in movies could be a sagacious, truthful and happy one. He could have some physical weakness or deformity or naivety as people exploit his/her weaknesses. Some examples of such child archetypes found in movies are referred to in several documents and research as follows.Charlie in Charlie and Chocolate FactoryForrest Gump as a child in Forrest GumpAlice as a child in Alice in Wonderland movieExample #5Creator ArchetypeThe creator archetypes are not just visionary and intelligent, they are also highly curious to create something new that could prove beneficial for the public. Such types of archetypes often make sacrifices in some cases and prove highly self-centered when it comes to perfection in their talent or skill. They achieve this perfectionism at the cost of their family life and relations. Interestingly, they are often a failure case in terms of handing over their talent to their progeny.Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate FactoryMozart in AmadeusChristian in Moulin RougeExample #6Caregiver ArchetypeSuch character archetypes take care of the persons in their custody. They even take risks and sacrifice their lives for this cause. They are also kindhearted, generous, and altruistic. They take care of their wards without rewards and put their own survival at stake when it comes to risks to the life of their wards. Such characters are often single-minded and highly focused. Some of the best caregiver archetype examples are as follows.The Weasleys in Harry PotterClarence Oldbody in It Is a Wonderful LifeLeight Anne Tuohy in The BlindsideExample #7Mentor ArchetypeThis type of archetype character uses logical reasoning, magic, knowledge, or learning. They often teach the people around them about how to move ahead in life. They have a commanding personality and calming presence, including the presence of mind to give ears to anyone facing problems and issues. Their consultation and pieces of advice include everything. Such characters often ignore their persona and their problems. Some of the best mentor archetypes in the movies are as follows.Jay Pritchett in Modern Family movieGandalf from Lord of the RingsQ group in James Bonds moviesExample #8Joker ArchetypeJoker archetypes are characters that cause humor in movies through different means. These means include wit, jokes, comic incidents, events, and even self-directed humor. Such archetypes also appear in tragedy as well to provide comic relief after the tension reaches its climax. When the audiences laugh, they feel relieved. Jokers usually present the sunny side of life or a distraction to cause relief from some painful event or situation. Some of the best joker archetypes in movies are as follows.Pumba in The Lion KingCaptain Jack in Pirates of the CaribbeanChandler Bing in FriendsExample #9Magician ArchetypeMagician archetypes are characters who demonstrate their knowledge of the esoteric world, use abracadabra, and seek to understand the situation, context, and history of the events to find out the solutions to the problems confronting them or their community. Sometimes, they use this knowledge against the people. Yet, they show pride and overconfidence, which mar their repute among the public. Lacking humility and excessive anger, too, contribute to their downfall. Some of the magician archetypes in movies are as follows.Ricky Jay in Deceptive PracticeGeorge Meleis in HugoEd Norton in The IllusionistExample #10Ruler ArchetypeThe ruler type of archetypes comprises tribal regions, regional leaders, country rulers, kings, emperors, chiefs, and even town rulers. They could be running companies, countries, or even educational institutions. Such archetypes are responsible persons in their own right and demonstrate the qualities and values befitting for a ruler, such as power, leadership, eloquence, and articulation to win the respect and awe of the common public. Some of the best ruler archetypes in movies are as follows.Churchill in The Darkest HourQueen Anne in The FavoriteJulius Caesar in Rome SeriesRelated posts:20 Major Types of Archetypes with Examples15

This imaginary comparison is often between the archetype and a living character, an object that is immediately present or a thing that is quite popular. Even some examples of such archetypes have appeared in the movies and have become popular. Some of the best archetype examples from movies are as follows.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <example>\n            <name>Everyman Archetype</name>\n            <description>These types of archetypes are often orphans, common individuals, or persons. In such cases, this type of archetype demonstrates a real picture of a person who seems similar to it. Such archetype examples are solidly virtuous, innocent, and realist. They do not pretend or show pretentions. They accept others, honor them and behave in a dignified manner, seem friendly and fair in dealings, and show understanding in relations. They continue enjoying the simple life, demonstrating all common values of loyalty, faith, and hope.</description>\n            <examples>\n                <movie>George Bailey in <title>It’s a Wonderful Life</title></movie>\n                <movie>Benjamin “Ben” McKenna in <title>The Man Who Knew Too Much</title></movie>\n                <movie>Frodo Baggins in <title>The Lord of the Rings</title></movie>\n                <movie>Huck Finn in <title>Huckleberry Finn</title></movie>\n            </examples>\n        </example>\n\n        <example>\n            <name>Innocent Archetype</name>\n            <description>Such archetypes are not only mystics and dreamers but are often romantic and even naïve. They demonstrate their optimism, natural goodness, and faith in God with simplicity in manners. As they are pure, showing purity of life and virtue, they often demonstrate positivism, hope, and optimism. Strong personal values drive their life toward blissfulness.</description>\n            <examples>\n                <movie>Forrest Gump in <title>Forrest Gump</title></movie>\n                <movie>Dorothy in <title>The Wizard of Oz</title></movie>\n                <movie>Alice in <title>Alice in Wonderland</title></movie>\n            </examples>\n        </example>\n\n        <example>\n            <name>Hero Archetype</name>\n            <description>Hero archetype includes all types of heroes such as a soldier, tribal chief, just ruler, warrior, crusader, dragon slayer, deliverer, or even a superhero.

The story centers around protagonist Leonora Shaw (known as “Nora” in the present day and formerly as “Lee” and “Leo”). The narrative alternates between scenes from the present, with Nora in the hospital after a car accident, and Nora’s spotty recollections of the weekend party that took place in the immediate past. Nora has a head wound and senses that something terrible happened, something that forced her to run desperately through the dark forest.\n\nOther works by this author include The Woman in Cabin 10, The Turn of The Key, and The It Girl.\n\nGet access to this full Study Guide and much more!\n\n- 9,000+ In-Depth Study Guides\n- 4,650+ Quick-Read Plot Summaries\n- Downloadable PDFs\n\nThe main part of the story details the hen do (bachelorette party) that Nora attends. The invitation to this party was a shock to Nora, as the bride-to-be is Clare Cavendish, who was Nora’s best friend through primary and secondary school, but whom she has not seen in the decade since then. Nora alludes to some serious situation that makes her want to keep her former friends like Clare in her past. Nora does not want to go to the hen party but feels compelled to go when the maid of honor, Florence “Flo” Clay, begs her to come. Another invitee is Nora’s friend Nina de Souza, the only friend from school with whom she has kept in touch.\n\nNora and Nina arrive at the hen weekend, held at a remote house in the forest owned by Flo’s aunt. The other guests are Melanie Cho, a new mother who knew Clare and Flo at university, and Tom Deauxma, who worked with Clare for the Royal Theatre Company.\n\nThe SuperSummary difference\n\n- 8x more resources than SparkNotes and CliffsNotes combined\n- Study Guides you won’t find anywhere else\n- 125+ fresh titles added every month\n\nClare reveals that she is marrying James Cooper, who was Nora’s boyfriend in school. This news shocks Nora. After their breakup, Nora severed contact from James and has not seen him in the 10 years since. In Nora’s narration, there are veiled indications that some crucial, unfinished matter exists between Nora and James. This mysterious event influences the reclusive way Nora has lived her life since school.\n\nThere is a lot of tension at the party that evening, due to the strangely oppressive house, Flo’s extremely overbearing need to make this the “perfect” hen do for Clare, and Nora’s struggle to deal with her undisclosed, traumatic memories concerning Clare and James. Nina makes sarcastic jokes about Nora and James during the party that upsets Nora. When Nora wants to go to bed before the others, Flo becomes enraged, proclaiming that Nora is “ruining” Clare’s hen party.\n\nIn the morning, Melanie decides to leave. She misses her baby and is not enjoying the party. Because there is no cell phone reception at the house and the landline has gone down, she can’t reach her family and insists on returning home. Flo is again furious and then inconsolable that the party is being “ruined.” The group goes to a clay pigeon shooting range that day and Flo gives the others a “How well do you know the groom?” quiz.\n\nInterspersed in the chapters detailing the party are brief chapters set in the present time, with Nora in the hospital. She overhears that someone has died and then later hears that the police suspect murder. Nora desperately tries to remember what happened. Later chapters reveal that James died at the house. Nora remembers holding James after he received a bullet wound. She also remembers running after Clare’s car, but she can’t remember what led up to those events. James’s best man, Matt, comes to visit Nora at the hospital and reveals that James and Clare had relationship problems.\n\nAfter returning from the shooting range, the group has dinner and then Flo organizes an Ouija board séance. After Nina and Tom make a few joking “messages,” the group is very unsettled when the board writes out “Mmmmmmuurderrrrrrrrrrrrrer.” No one admits to having pushed the planchette.\n\nAfter the hen do attendees go to bed, they all hear a noise downstairs. The locked door in the kitchen is banging open. Flo takes the shotgun from the mantle to deter any intruders. Everyone returns to bed, but soon, they hear more noises. The group huddles at the top of the stairs, Flo clutching the shotgun. They hear footsteps and see a figure coming up the stairs. The gun goes off, and to her horror, Nora realizes that Flo unwittingly shot James. Nina, who is a doctor, tries to stabilize his wound. Clare brings her car to the front door, claiming that she was away trying to get a cell phone signal. They carry James and place him in the backseat. Nina tries to accompany them in the car, but Clare drives off without her.\n\nNora’s memories start to blur, and she can’t clearly remember what happened next. Detective Constable Lamarr confronts Nora with her confiscated cell phone. The messages indicate that Nora asked James to come to the house that night, cementing Nora’s culpability in the crime. With this evidence, the police formally accuse Nora of conspiring to kill James.\n\nNora reveals in her narration the truth about why she left school and ex-communicated from her friends, including James. After Nora revealed her unexpected pregnancy to James, he sent her a cruel text, breaking up with her and telling her that the baby was her problem. With Clare’s help, Nora had an abortion, then left school.\n\nNow, Nora must prove she is not James’s murderer, so she escapes from the hospital. Nora takes a taxi back to Flo’s aunt’s house. She reenacts the events of the night of the shooting and remembers that after Clare drove away, she found a blank shotgun shell in Clare’s coat. Clare arrives at the house and offers to make her and Nora a cup of tea. As they talk, Nora has an epiphany. She remembers that the breakup text from James called her “Lee,” Clare’s nickname for her. James always called Nora “Leo.” Nora realizes that Clare sent the text to ensure Nora and James’s breakup. Nora confronts Clare, and Clare admits that she finally confessed her duplicitous action to James. Angered, James insisted that Clare tell Nora, so Clare invited Nora to the hen do to reveal the truth.\n\nNora realizes that Clare planned James’s death to conceal her treachery and protect her reputation. Clare had Flo send text messages from Nora’s phone to set her up as the murderer. With this realization, Nora tries to run away from Clare but finds herself in a daze. Confused, Nora spills her tea and sees that Clare has put grounded up pills into the drink to poison her. Nora urgently escapes from the house and runs into the dark forest. Clare follows in her car but crashes into the investigating detective’s patrol car.\n\nNora wakes up in the hospital again. The police now know Clare killed James and have enough proof to charge her. Nora learns that Flo, ridden with guilt from her part in the murder, swallowed pills with the intent to kill herself and later died from the after-effects.\n\nAt the end of the story, Nora is back home in London. Away from the traumatic events surrounding both her past and James’s recent death, Nora finds relief in her familiar surroundings. Amid this calm, she receives an email from Matt, James’s best friend. The novel ends without revealing whether Nora decides to read his email.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnlock all 67 pages of this Study Guide\n\nPlus, gain access to 9,000+ more expert-written Study Guides.\n\nIncluding features:\n\n## Related Titles\n\nBy Ruth Ware\n\nOne by One\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne Perfect Couple\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Death of Mrs. Westaway\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe It Girl\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Lying Game\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Turn of The Key\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Woman in Cabin 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nZero Days\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Featured Collections\n\n976\n\nFriendship\n\nView Collection\n\n341\n\nHorror, Thrillers, &amp; Suspense\n\nView Collection\n\n401\n\nMystery &amp; Crime\n\nView Collection\n\n458\n\nTrust &amp; Doubt\n\nView Collection\n\n913\n\nTruth &amp; Lies\n\nView Collection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7-day Money-Back Guarantee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompany\n\nAbout Us\n\nOur Literary Experts\n\nWall of Love\n\nWork With Us\n\nlibrary\n\nStudy Guides\n\nTeaching Guides\n\nPlot Summaries\n\nStudy Guide Collections\n\nNew This Week\n\nBook Briefs\n\nresources\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nResource Guides\n\nDiscussion Questions Tool\n\nreaders\n\nStudent\n\nTeacher\n\nBook Club Member\n\nParent\n\ncontact\n\nHelp\n\nFeedback\n\nSuggest a Title",

            "content": "A.I. in Screen Trade\n\nScreenwriting, Hollywood, and the Future of AI Storytelling\n\n# Unraveling the Enigma: Writing Complex Characters in ‘Shutter Island’\n\n### Introduction to Character Complexity in ‘Shutter Island’\n\n“Shutter Island,” directed by Martin Scorsese and based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, stands as a monumental work in the realm of psychological thrillers. At its heart, the film is an intricate labyrinth of human psyche exploration, set against the backdrop of a mysterious psychiatric facility. The narrative’s power is amplified by its complex characters, especially the protagonist, Teddy Daniels. These characters are not merely cogs in the plot machinery but are the essence of the story’s exploration of reality, memory, and identity. The importance of character complexity in such narratives cannot be overstated, as it engages the audience on a deeper emotional level, inviting them to decipher the enigma alongside the characters themselves.\n\nThe film introduces us to U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, who are dispatched to Ashecliffe Hospital on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. From the onset, the island itself, shrouded in fog and secrecy, mirrors the complexity of the characters it houses. Teddy, as the focal point of this enigmatic tale, is a character study in trauma, guilt, and the quest for truth. His journey is not just a physical one across the island but a psychological deep dive into his own tormented past.\n\nThe complexity of characters in psychological thrillers like “Shutter Island” plays a crucial role in the narrative’s ability to captivate and maintain suspense. It challenges the audience’s perceptions and expectations, creating a dynamic interaction between viewer and film. Teddy’s character, layered with hidden motives and repressed memories, serves as a conduit for the audience’s own exploration of the film’s themes. His interactions with the island’s inhabitants, each character revealing their own secrets and motivations, create a rich tapestry of human emotion and psychological depth.\n\nCharacter complexity also serves a dual purpose; it not only drives the narrative forward but also enriches it, offering multiple interpretations of the story’s events. In “Shutter Island,” every character interaction, every revealed secret, adds another layer to the mystery, compelling the audience to question what is real and what is a product of the mind. This questioning is the essence of the film’s engagement, as viewers are drawn into Teddy’s quest, empathizing with his struggles and sharing in his revelations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoreover, the film’s exploration of complex characters extends beyond mere narrative devices. It delves into the human condition, examining themes of loss, guilt, and the nature of sanity. Through Teddy, “Shutter Island” poses poignant questions about the coping mechanisms of the human mind and the lengths to which it will go to protect itself from painful truths. This exploration is made possible by the character’s depth and the skill with which his psychological journey is depicted. The audience is not just observing Teddy’s quest; they are emotionally invested in it, feeling each twist and turn as acutely as the protagonist himself.\n\nThe role of character complexity in engaging the audience is evident in the film’s ability to sustain attention and provoke thought long after the credits roll. By presenting characters with rich inner lives and unresolved conflicts, “Shutter Island” invites viewers to ponder the nature of identity and reality. This engagement is not passive; it demands active participation from the audience, who must navigate the layers of character and narrative to uncover the truth. The complexity of Teddy and the island’s other inhabitants ensures that this journey is as challenging as it is rewarding, offering no easy answers but a multitude of perspectives to consider.\n\n### Dissecting Teddy Daniels: A Study in Trauma and Illusion\n\nIn the shadowy corridors of Ashecliffe Hospital and the tempestuous landscape of Shutter Island, Teddy Daniels emerges as a character profoundly marked by trauma, haunted by a past that seems to bleed into his reality. As the protagonist of this enigmatic narrative, Teddy is not merely a U.S. Marshal on a routine investigation; he is a man on a precipice, navigating the blurred lines between truth and delusion. This section delves into the intricate layers of Teddy’s character, exploring how his background, the interplay between reality and illusion, and the screenplay’s techniques together craft a portrait of a man in the throes of an internal maelstrom.\n\nExploration of Teddy Daniels as the protagonist: Background and introduction.\n\nTeddy’s introduction on the ferry to Shutter Island is our first glimpse into his complex character. Ostensibly there to investigate a patient’s disappearance, Teddy’s stoic exterior belies a tumultuous inner world. His background as a World War II veteran and the tragic loss of his wife, Dolores, are not mere footnotes in his story but the very foundation of his fractured psyche. These elements of his past are meticulously revealed, piece by piece, drawing the audience deeper into Teddy’s personal labyrinth.\n\nAs the investigation progresses, Teddy’s motivations begin to unravel, suggesting that his presence on the island is driven by more than professional duty. His nightmares, flashbacks, and hallucinations of Dolores hint at a deep-seated trauma, suggesting that Shutter Island is more than just a setting for the narrative; it is a psychological battleground where Teddy’s demons are as real as the inmates he encounters.\n\nThe layers of Teddy’s character: Reality vs. delusion.\n\nTeddy Daniels is a study in contradiction, embodying the tension between the desire for truth and the comfort of delusion. His quest to uncover the island’s secrets mirrors his struggle to confront his own past. The screenplay masterfully navigates Teddy’s journey, blurring the lines between reality and illusion, leaving both Teddy and the audience questioning what is real.\n\nThis ambiguity is central to Teddy’s character. His interactions with the island’s staff and patients reveal his deep-seated paranoia and distrust, traits that at first seem to be hallmarks of a seasoned detective but gradually appear to be symptoms of a deeper psychological issue. The revelation of his true identity—Andrew Laeddis—forces a reevaluation of everything that has transpired, presenting Teddy’s quest as a tragic journey of self-discovery. This twist not only redefines Teddy’s character but also challenges the audience’s perception of him, transforming him from a hero into a tragic figure trapped in his own mind.\n\nTechniques used in the screenplay to reveal Teddy’s complexity and internal conflict.\n\nThe screenplay employs a variety of techniques to peel back the layers of Teddy’s character, each designed to deepen the audience’s understanding of his psyche. The use of flashbacks and hallucinations serves as a window into Teddy’s tormented soul, revealing the depth of his trauma and guilt over Dolores’s death. These moments are not just narrative devices but reflections of Teddy’s internal struggle, blurring the line between his past and present, his reality and delusions.\n\nDialogue also plays a crucial role in revealing Teddy’s complexity. His exchanges with Dr. Cawley and Chuck Aule are laden with subtext, often hinting at Teddy’s true nature and the island’s influence on him. These conversations are chess games, with each move uncovering more about Teddy’s character and his perception of reality.\n\nMoreover, the screenplay’s structure itself mirrors Teddy’s disorientation. The nonlinear narrative, with its sudden shifts in time and perspective, places the audience in Teddy’s shoes, making them experience his confusion and uncertainty firsthand. This technique not only enhances the suspense but also deepens the audience’s empathy for Teddy, as they too grapple with distinguishing truth from illusion.\n\nThe cinematography and setting further contribute to the portrayal of Teddy’s internal conflict. The stark, imposing landscape of Shutter Island, with its cliffs, storms, and the ever-present sea, serves as a metaphor for Teddy’s turmoil. The visual contrast between the island’s beauty and its underlying menace reflects the duality of Teddy’s character—his outward quest for justice and his inward journey into madness.\n\n### Supporting Cast: Mirrors to Teddy’s Psyche\n\nIn “Shutter Island,” the supporting cast serves as more than mere foils or adversaries to Teddy Daniels; they are integral to the unfolding of the narrative and to the deepening of the film’s exploration into the psyche of its protagonist. Characters such as Dr. Cawley, Chuck Aule, and the elusive Andrew Laeddis are intricately woven into the fabric of the story, each reflecting and contrasting aspects of Teddy’s turmoil, thereby enriching the narrative and Teddy’s journey towards self-discovery.\n\nAnalysis of key supporting characters (Dr. Cawley, Chuck Aule, and Andrew Laeddis) and how they reflect and contrast Teddy’s inner turmoil.\n\nDr. Cawley, the superintendent of Ashecliffe Hospital, stands as a pivotal character whose interactions with Teddy are laced with ambiguity and psychological depth. He is both a guide and an antagonist, pushing Teddy towards the truth while seemingly obfuscating it. Dr. Cawley’s calm demeanor and his philosophical musings on the nature of sanity and treatment methods contrast sharply with Teddy’s agitation and skepticism. This opposition serves to highlight Teddy’s internal conflict between accepting his reality and clinging to his delusions. Dr. Cawley, in his role, mirrors Teddy’s potential for self-awareness and the possibility of healing, offering a glimpse into what Teddy could become if he confronts his past.\n\nChuck Aule, Teddy’s partner, represents another facet of Teddy’s psyche. Chuck’s loyalty and his seemingly straightforward approach to the investigation provide Teddy—and by extension, the audience—with a sense of normalcy and stability. However, as the narrative unfolds, Chuck’s true identity and purpose come into question, paralleling Teddy’s descent into confusion and paranoia. Chuck’s transformation from an ally into a reflection of Teddy’s delusions underscores the protagonist’s struggle with trust and perception, making Chuck a crucial element in the exploration of Teddy’s fractured identity.\n\nThe figure of Andrew Laeddis, the man Teddy believes is responsible for his wife’s death, is the most direct reflection of Teddy’s inner turmoil. The gradual revelation that Teddy Daniels is, in fact, Andrew Laeddis, is a narrative twist that redefines the entire story. Andrew represents Teddy’s guilt, his unacknowledged complicity in the tragedy of his past, and his most profound fears. The interactions with, and the search for, Andrew are symbolic of Teddy’s confrontation with his own darkest aspects, making Andrew not just a character but a manifestation of Teddy’s need for redemption and self-forgiveness.\n\nThe use of supporting characters to enhance the narrative and Teddy’s journey.\n\nThe brilliance of “Shutter Island” lies not only in its complex protagonist but also in how the supporting characters are utilized to enhance the narrative’s depth and emotional impact. These characters do not exist solely to advance the plot; they are essential to the thematic exploration of the story, serving as catalysts for Teddy’s introspection and evolution. Through their interactions with Teddy, the audience is provided with different perspectives on the nature of guilt, memory, and the possibility of redemption. Each character brings a different lens through which to view Teddy’s plight, enriching the narrative with their unique insights and challenges.\n\nFurthermore, the supporting characters act as mirrors to Teddy’s psyche, reflecting the various facets of his struggle with identity and reality. They embody the themes of the film, engaging the audience in a more profound exploration of its central questions. This interaction between Teddy and the supporting cast creates a dynamic and multifaceted narrative that encourages viewers to question the nature of truth and perception, just as Teddy does.\n\nConclusion: The impact of character complexity on the film’s success and audience perception.\n\nThe complexity of the characters in “Shutter Island” significantly contributes to the film’s success and its impact on the audience. By crafting characters with depth and ambiguity, the film invites viewers to engage in a narrative that is as intellectually challenging as it is emotionally resonant. The characters, especially in their roles as reflections and contrasts to Teddy’s inner world, enrich the narrative, transforming the film from a mere psychological thriller into a profound exploration of human consciousness.\n\nThe interplay between Teddy and the supporting cast not only drives the narrative forward but also deepens its thematic concerns, offering insights into the nature of trauma, the constructs of identity, and the quest for truth. This layered character complexity ensures that “Shutter Island” remains a subject of discussion and analysis, highlighting the power of well-developed characters to evoke empathy, challenge perceptions, and provoke thought.\n\nIn conclusion, the supporting characters in “Shutter Island” are integral to the film’s narrative structure and emotional depth. Through their interactions with Teddy, they reveal the complexities of his character and the themes at the heart of the story. Their roles as mirrors to Teddy’s psyche enhance the film’s exploration of psychological and existential questions, making “Shutter Island” a compelling study of the human condition. The character complexity not only contributes to the film’s success but also cements its place as a masterpiece in the genre, demonstrating the enduring power of nuanced storytelling and character development.\n\n✍️  Whether you’re mastering the art of dialogue, structure, or character development, the power of AI can be a game-changer in your writing journey. My Free Ebook, ‘AI for Authors’ delves into how AI-powered prompts can provide a unique edge to your storytelling process.

Flynn’s portrayal of small-town dynamics and the facade of Southern gentility hiding deep-seated dysfunctions was spot on. The characters, especially Camille, are deeply flawed, making them feel real and relatable, even when their actions are hard to digest. I appreciated the exploration of complex mother-daughter relationships and the generational trauma that can ensue. Adora’s character, in particular, was both fascinating and horrifying, embodying a twisted form of maternal care that left me both enraged and empathetic towards Camille’s plight. However, the novel’s intense focus on psychological trauma and self-harm can be heavy, and there were moments when I had to pause and process the weight of the content. The pacing, while building suspense effectively, occasionally felt slow, especially when delving into Camille’s internal struggles. Overall, Sharp Objects is a compelling read that delves deep into the psyche of its characters, offering a dark and twisted narrative that kept me engaged, even if it left me a bit unsettled at times."

                "reviewerThoughts": "Diving into Sharp Objects was like peeling back layers of a very dark onion—each revelation more unsettling than the last. Flynn’s portrayal of small-town dynamics and the facade of Southern gentility hiding deep-seated dysfunctions was spot on. The characters, especially Camille, are deeply flawed, making them feel real and relatable, even when their actions are hard to digest. I appreciated the exploration of complex mother-daughter relationships and the generational trauma that can ensue. Adora’s character, in particular, was both fascinating and horrifying, embodying a twisted form of maternal care that left me both enraged and empathetic towards Camille’s plight. However, the novel’s intense focus on psychological trauma and self-harm can be heavy, and there were moments when I had to pause and process the weight of the content. The pacing, while building suspense effectively, occasionally felt slow, especially when delving into Camille’s internal struggles. Overall, Sharp Objects is a compelling read that delves deep into the psyche of its characters, offering a dark and twisted narrative that kept me engaged, even if it left me a bit unsettled at times."
