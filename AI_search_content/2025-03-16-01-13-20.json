            "Plot Summary": "In an alternate 2008, <b>Tasya Vos</b> is an assassin who takes control of other people's bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos' consciousness is inserted into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of the job, although the movie's intro sequence has her deviate from her protocol and struggling to commit suicide by her own gun, getting the host shot by shooting at arriving police forces instead. Vos struggles with neurological symptoms and increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, <b>Michael</b>, and son, <b>Ira</b>. She 'practices' assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael. Vos' handler, retired assassin <b>Girder</b>, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it. Despite her fragile mental state and fatigue, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO <b>John Parse</b> and his daughter, <b>Ava</b>, by possessing Ava's fiancé, <b>Colin Tate</b>. While assuming the host's life, the neurological symptoms worsen, but Vos hides this during her handler's check-ins. The hit is only a partial success as Ava dies, but not Parse. Vos attempts to finish the job per protocol by forcing Tate to shoot himself, but again cannot make him pull the trigger. During a dissociative break, in which Vos struggles to remain in control of Tate's body, he stabs himself in the skull, damaging the implant and causing severe neurological symptoms on Vos' own body, causing her internal physical damage. Vos discovers she can neither leave Tate's body, nor overpower his consciousness. Tate regains control, but is severely disoriented, in shock and traumatized from the violence before him, so he flees the crime scene. He seeks refuge with his friend <b>Reeta</b>, while experiencing fragmented memories of Vos' life. He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava. <b>Eddie</b>, a co-employee from Tate's workplace who reveals himself to be a plant from Vos' agency, arrives at the apartment to help Vos regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails and Tate kills Eddie during another dissociative episode in which Tate becomes aware of Vos' presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child, and home. Tate goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. Vos appears inside Tate’s mind and goads Tate into killing Michael. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver, in a similar manner as the movie's opening sequence's job. Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, killing him, also reminiscent to the opening sequence's stabbing. Vos uses Tate's last moments to shoot Ira dead, who is then revealed to also have been a host. Vos returns to her own body and discovers that it was Girder who had taken control of Ira. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, as Girder wanted. In another debriefing, Vos sorts through her personal objects again. She contemplates and recognizes the butterfly, but does not express any guilt for killing it. Girder smiles and replies, 'Very good.'",

            "Plot Summary": "In a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the kind), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The remaining population, the Factionless, holds no status or privilege. Upon turning sixteen, children undergo a serum-induced psychological aptitude test that reveals their best-suited faction, although they can choose any faction as their permanent group during the subsequent Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice Prior lives in Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew, and Abnegation's leader, Marcus Eaton, serve on the ruling council. When Beatrice was tested, her results show equal attributes of multiple factions: Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless, making her a Divergent. Her proctor Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation. She warns her to conceal her accurate results because Divergents can think independently and would threaten the existing social order. The next day, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite at the Choosing Ceremony, while she selects Dauntless. She meets Christina, Al, and Will, other faction transfers. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. A harsh Dauntless leader, Eric Colter, warns the initiates that those who fail to meet the faction's high standards will become Factionless. Beatrice jumps from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net and gaining respect from Four, a transferred instructor. Beatrice initially struggles in Dauntless training and ranks far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help, she slowly improves. Eric then matches her against her nemesis, Candor transfer Peter Hayes, in a fight that ends with Beatrice's defeat and recovery in the infirmary. Unwilling to miss the crucial Capture the Flag test, she leaves the infirmary, joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut. In the next training phase, the initiates confront their deepest fears in psychological simulations. Beatrice's divergence enables her to creatively navigate the tests, but Four cautions her to conceal her abilities and approach the challenges like a typical Dauntless would. Beatrice visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her, but Four rescues her. Al begs Tris to forgive him the next day, but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into 'The Pit'. Four takes Beatrice into his fear simulations to prepare her for the final test. There, she learns that he is Tobias Eaton and that his father, Marcus, used to beat him as a child. Beatrice then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The Dauntless recruits are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for mind control. The next day, the Dauntless prepares to attack Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who is also Divergent. When the Dauntless raids Abnegation, they split from their group to find Beatrice's parents. However, Eric captures Four, realizing he isn’t under control, and orders Beatrice's execution. Her mother, Natalie, a former Dauntless, saves her but is later shot and killed during their escape. Tris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, so Beatrice goes in alone to find Four, who is now under mind control designed for Divergents. Knowing Four's fears, Beatrice manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader, Jeanine Matthews, has Dauntless execute nearly the entire Abnegation faction. Beatrice uses a sample of the mind control serum on herself to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.",

There he is placed under the supervision of lab worker Lester to help load supplies onto an experimental rocket ship. While on board with Lester, Orville flips the ignition switch and the rocket ship blasts off, flying across the country and eventually landing outside of New Orleans, where Mardi Gras is in progress. Lester and Orville, believing that they have successfully landed on Mars, don spacesuits and go into the city, where they assume the grotesquely costumed celebrants are Martians, while the others assume they are fellow costumed celebrants. Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse and Mugsy, stumble upon the rocket ship, put on spacesuits and head to New Orleans to rob a bank and steal clothes. Lester and Orville are wrongly accused of the crimes and flee back to the rocket ship, where Mugsy and Harry force them to launch and demand to actually go to Mars. However, once in outer space, Lester and Orville get control of the crooks' gun and attempt to land back on Earth. The ship instead lands on Venus, where the four men are quickly captured by female guards and brought to the ruler of the planet, Queen Allura. She informs them that Venus is inhabited only by women because men were banished long ago. She takes more than a liking to Orville and makes him her king consort on the condition that he remains true to her. Orville agrees, and has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned. However, Mugsy convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove to Queen Allura that he cannot be trusted. Disillusioned with Orville, the Queen orders all the men to leave Venus. Upon returning to the Earth, the men are lauded as heroes in a parade, but Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a spaceship to Earth to drop a cake on Orville's head.",

This scenario is known as the Kessler syndrome, named after N.A.S.A. scientist Donald J. Kessler who first proposed the theory in 1978. A cascading Kessler syndrome involving an object the size of the International Space Station would trigger a catastrophic chain-reaction of debris. The orbiting debris field would make it impossible to launch space exploration missions or satellites for many decades.\n\n- GoofsWhen Kowalski asks Stone to let go of him because the rope will not hold them both, that could never happen because they are both in the same orbit around the earth. A short simple tug would have brought him back to her. Additionally, once they are drifting away from the ISS, disconnecting from Kowalski would not cause her to rebound back toward the ISS unless another force pulled her back in its direction. At most she would stop when the ropes reach the end of their slack, in which case Kowalsky would also have stopped.\n\n- QuotesMatt Kowalski: Listen, do you wanna go back, or do you wanna stay here? I get it. It's nice up here. You can just shut down all the systems, turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everyone. There's nobody up here that can hurt you. It's safe. I mean, what's the point of going on? What's the point of living? Your kid died. Doesn't get any rougher than that. But still, it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go, then you gotta just get on with it. Sit back, enjoy the ride. You gotta plant both your feet on the ground and start livin' life. Hey, Ryan? It's time to go home.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe director thanks his mother during the end credits, in Spanish: \"a mi mamá, gracias\".\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Filmselskabet: Episode #4.1 (2013)\n\n- SoundtracksAngels are Hard to Find\nWritten and Performed by Hank Williams Jr.\nCourtesy of Curb Records, Inc.\n\n### User reviews2.3K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### In Space No One Can Hear You Scream\n\nArguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, \"In space no one can hear you scream\" Alien's \"In space no one can hear you scream\" tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuarón's latest thriller, Gravity.\n\nStarring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.\n\nTheir struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.\n\nBullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.\n\nWith only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.\n\nGravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.\n\nCuarón incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.\n\nWith still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com\n\n- gregsrants\n- Sep 13, 2013\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ27\n\n- How long is Gravity?Powered by Alexa\n- Why are all of the space stations unmanned?\n- What does \"Houston Blind\" mean?\n- What is 'Gravity' about?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 3, 2013 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Greenlandic\n- Also known as\n    - Gravedad\n- Filming locations\n    - Space(Earth's orbit)\n- Production companies\n    - Warner Bros.\n    - Esperanto Filmoj\n    - Heyday Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $100,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $274,092,705\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $55,785,112\n    - Oct 6, 2013\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $723,719,539\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 31 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Datasat\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - SDDS\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Writer, Producer, and Director Sir Christopher Nolan accepted these terms, as long as they did not get in the way of the making of the movie. That did not prevent clashes, though; at one point Thorne spent two weeks talking Nolan out of an idea about travelling faster than light.\n\n- GoofsTwo characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform. A moment later, a panoramic shot shows them fighting on a very different place.\n\n- QuotesCooper: We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.\n\n- Crazy creditsThe Warner Bros, Paramount, Syncopy and Legendary Pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing Earth's arid dry state in the film.\n\n- Alternate versionsThe 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Trailer Failure: Interstellar (2013)\n\n- SoundtracksDo Not Go Gentle Into that Good Night\n(uncredited)\nWritten by Dylan Thomas\n\n### User reviews6.6K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Out of this world\n\nA lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.\n\nGoing out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...\n\n- kosmasp\n- May 30, 2015\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ34\n\n- How long is Interstellar?Powered by Alexa\n- Can someone how \"love\" and emotions can be considered quantifiable??\n- Why did Earth change its history books to claim that the Apollo missions to the Moon were faked?\n- How did Cooper figure out NASA's location?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - November 6, 2014 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - United Kingdom\n    - Canada\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official Twitter\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Interestelar\n- Filming locations\n    - Iceland\n- Production companies\n    - Paramount Pictures\n    - Warner Bros.\n    - Legendary Entertainment\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $165,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $203,227,580\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $47,510,360\n    - Nov 9, 2014\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $758,464,713\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 49 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Datasat\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - IMAX 6-Track\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The supporting cast features Michael Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, and Andy García. The film follows two passengers on an interstellar spacecraft carrying thousands of people to a colony 120-years-traveling-distance from Earth, when the two are awakened 90 years early from their suspended hibernation.\n\nThe script was written in 2007 by Spaihts, but languished in development with multiple actors attached and detached from it over the years until Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired its rights in late 2014. Lawrence, Pratt and Tyldum quickly joined the project, and filming spanned from September 2015 to February 2016 in Atlanta. It was produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, Start Motion Pictures, Original Film, LStar Capital, Wanda Pictures and Company Films, and was the last film from Columbia Pictures with the involvement of Village Roadshow Pictures.\n\nPassengers premiered at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles on December 14, 2016, and was released theatrically in the United States by Columbia Pictures on December 21, 2016. It received mixed reviews, with praise for Pratt's and Lawrence's performances, Thomas Newman's musical score, and its visual style and production values, but was criticized for its plot and characters.[5][6] It grossed $304 million worldwide and was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Production Design at the 89th Academy Awards.[7]\n\n## Plot\n\nThe Avalon, a sleeper ship transporting 5,000 colonists and 258 crew in hibernation pods, is traveling from Earth to the planet Homestead II, a 120-year journey as part of an exodus of Earth's population due to ecocide and the collapse of the biosphere.[8] After only 30 years, an asteroid collision damages the ship, causing a malfunction that awakens passenger Jim Preston, a mechanical engineer, 90 years early. He is unable to return to hibernation, and cannot contact Earth for help due to an overly long communication delay. He attempts to break into the crew hibernation room, in the hopes they will be able to help. He fails due to the strength of the ship's security systems. As the ship's AI systems cannot seem to comprehend the idea of a hibernation pod malfunction (as it had never occurred before), he eventually gives up, passing the time in several of the ship's entertainment zones.\n\nAfter a year of isolation, with only an android barman named Arthur for company, Jim grows despondent and contemplates suicide, until he notices Aurora Lane, a beautiful young woman inside a pod. He considers reviving her for companionship, but struggles doing so, knowing it is morally wrong and will preclude her intended life on their destination planet. He eventually awakens her, letting her believe it was a malfunction. Devastated at having to live out her life on the ship, Aurora tries to reenter hibernation. Resigned to the situation, she begins writing about her experience. Over the next year, the two fall in love. Just before Jim intends to propose to Aurora, Arthur inadvertently reveals the truth about her awakening. Distraught and enraged, Aurora berates, shuns, and physically attacks Jim. She furiously rejects his apologies and avoids contact with him.\n\nSometime later, another pod failure awakens Gus Mancuso, a deck chief officer. Using Gus's employee code, the group gets on the bridge and discovers cascading failures in the ship's systems. If left unrepaired, the ship will fail, causing the passengers and crew to perish. When Gus falls critically ill, the ship's automated medical suite, the Autodoc, diagnoses pansystemic necrosis and gives him hours to live. Gus attributes it to his hibernation pod's multiple failures. Before dying, he gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge and employee code to get into crew-only areas.\n\nJim and Aurora find hull breaches from the asteroid collision two years earlier. The computer module administering the ship's fusion reactor power plant has been damaged, causing the cascading malfunctions as the other systems' computing power was diverted in an attempt to maintain it. They replace the damaged module but when the computer attempts to vent the reactor to extinguish a runaway plasma reaction, the exterior vent fails. Jim is forced to spacewalk and vent the plasma from outside, using the manual controls in the vent tube.\n\nJim discovers that he must remain in the tube to keep the vent open while Aurora initiates venting from inside the ship. Revealing her feelings for him, she admits she is terrified of losing him and being alone. Jim improvises a heat shield and survives the venting but is blasted into space as his tether snaps, and his damaged spacesuit begins losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves a clinically dead Jim from space and resuscitates him in the Autodoc. The Avalon, its reactor repaired, returns to normal operations.\n\nAfter burying Gus in space, Jim learns the Autodoc can function as a hibernation pod for one person, and he insists that Aurora use it for the remainder of the voyage. Realizing she would never see Jim again, she chooses to remain awake with him. Eighty-eight years later, the ship's crew awaken on schedule, shortly before arrival at Homestead II. In the ship's grand concourse, they discover a huge tree with trailing vines, lush vegetation, flying birds, and a small cabin. A recording of Aurora's story describes the wonderful life she and Jim shared on the Avalon.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Chris Pratt as Jim Preston, a mechanical engineer\n- Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane, a journalist and writer\n- Michael Sheen as Arthur, an android bartender on the Avalon\n- Laurence Fishburne as Gus Mancuso, the chief deck officer\n- Andy García (in a non-speaking role) as Captain Norris, commanding officer of the Avalon\n- Julee Cerda and Nazanin Boniadi as hologram instructors\n- Aurora Perrineau as Celeste, Aurora's best friend seen in a video message\n\nEmma Clarke, Chris Edgerly, Matt Corboy, Fred Melamed, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts voices the Avalon, InfoMat, video game, observatory, and Autodoc, respectively.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nProduction Designer Guy Hendrix Dyas, Producer Ori Marmur and writer Jon Spaihts on set during filming.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Jon Spaihts's original 2007 script, Aurora's surname was Dunn.[9] At one point in the film's development, it was set to star Keanu Reeves and Emily Blunt.[10] Other actors temporarily attached to it included Reese Witherspoon and Rachel McAdams.[11] Brian Kirk was originally set to make his feature directorial debut with Reeves in the lead.[12][13] On December 5, 2014, it was announced that Sony Pictures Entertainment had won the rights to the film,[14] and in early 2015, Morten Tyldum was chosen to direct.[15] He had always wanted to do a big-scale sci-fi movie, but also stressed the importance of character development over effects.[16]\n\nThe final cast was announced between February 2015 and January 2016.[17][18][19][20] Lawrence was paid $20 million against 30% of the profit after the movie broke even. Pratt received $12 million.[11][21]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on September 15, 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[22][23] with most of it involving the two leads only. Rodrigo Prieto was cinematographer, and Maryann Brandon was film editor.[24][25] Filming wrapped on February 12, 2016.[26]\n\n### Music\n\nThomas Newman composed the score for Passengers.[27] Spaihts said that he wrote Passengers while listening to Newman's previous scores.[28] Imagine Dragons also recorded the song \"Levitate\" for the soundtrack, which was released on November 29, 2016.[29] The Chinese theme song for the film is \"Light Years Away\", composed by G.E.M.; it became the first Chinese music video to surpass 200 million views in September 2019.[30]\n\n## Marketing\n\nAt the 2016 CinemaCon, Passengers was featured by Sony Pictures chairman Thomas Rothman with Lawrence and Pratt in attendance. A teaser trailer of unfinished footage was shown afterward.[31] The first official images of the film were released on August 12, 2016.[32]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Regency Village Theater in December 14, 2016. It was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Entertainment on December 21, 2016.[33]\n\n### Home media\n\nPassengers was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 14, 2017, and made available on digital HD from Amazon Video and iTunes on March 7, 2017.[34]\nOn March 14, 2017, Passengers: Awakening, a virtual-reality experience based on the film launched for  Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.[35]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nPassengers grossed $100 million in the United States and Canada and $203.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $303.1 million, against a net production budget of $110 million.[4][3] It was the second-highest grossing original live-action Hollywood release of 2016, after La La Land.[36]\n\nPassengers opened alongside Sing and Assassin's Creed, and was initially expected to gross around $50 million from 3,478 theaters over its first six days, although the studio anticipated a more conservative $35 million debut.[37][38] After making $1.2 million from Tuesday night previews[39] and $4.1 million on its first day, projections for the six-day opening were lowered to $27 million.[40] It went on to gross $15.1 million in its opening weekend (a six-day total of $30 million), finishing third at the box office behind Rogue One and Sing.[41] It became the third-biggest original live-action domestic release of 2016 behind La La Land ($149 million) and Central Intelligence ($126 million).[36]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Passengers holds an approval rating of 30% based on 288 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Passengers proves Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together–and that even their chemistry isn't enough to overcome a fatally flawed story.\"[42] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[43] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 77% overall positive score.[41]\n\nMick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing: \"Despite the confinement and the limited cast, Passengers has moments of intense drama that take the actors to places of extreme feeling.\"[44] James Dyer of Empire gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, calling it \"as surprisingly traditional as it is undeniably effective\", and describing it as \"Titanic amongst the stars\" and \"a touching, heartfelt tale of loss and love for the Gravity generation\".[45] Peter Keough of The Boston Globe gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing: \"Perhaps as a well-written play for a cast of three, Passengers might have been first class. Instead, it's just another mediocre thrill ride.\"[46] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the film an \"appealing sci-fi romance\", but criticized its final act as an \"anticlimax\", giving it 3 out of 5 stars.[47] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said it \"concocts a sort of Titanic in outer space, with dollops of 'Sleeping Beauty' and Gravity thrown into the high-concept mix.\" She praised the striking visual design and elegant costumes, but said that the \"heavy-handed mix of life-or-death exigencies and feel-good bromides finally feels like a case of more being less.\"[1]\n\nRebecca Hawkes of The Telegraph described the film as not a romance, but \"a creepy ode to manipulation\", describing the action as a \"central act of violence\" that is softened and justified.[48] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian called it an \"interstellar version of social-media stalking\" with \"a fantastically creepy start\" that, contrary to romantic comedies that managed to \"plane down\" the nastiness of stalking tactics, presented them in a way where they were \"gruesomely inescapable\".[49] Alissa Wilkinson of Vox called it \"a fantasy of Stockholm syndrome, in which the captured eventually identifies with and even loves the captor\" and \"a really disturbing wish fulfillment fantasy\".[50]\n\nLawrence was initially proud of the film, but agreed with suggestions that it might have benefited from a different edit, starting with her character waking up.[6][51] Later, she expressed regret over starring in the film, saying that Adele had advised her against it and that she should have listened.[52][53] Producer Neal H. Moritz said he loved the film and thought the script was one of the best he had ever read. He pointed out that it was well received at test screenings, but that shortly before its release the media picked up on one review and \"it became a mantra\". He \"thought it was a really unfair thing because I think it's a beautiful film I couldn't be more proud of.\"[6]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                      | Date of ceremony    | Category                                           | Recipients                        | Result    | Ref.    |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Academy Awards             | February 26, 2017   | Best Original Score                                | Thomas Newman                     | Nominated | [54][7] |\n| Academy Awards             | February 26, 2017   | Best Production Design                             | Guy Hendrix Dyas and Gene Serdena | Nominated | [54][7] |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | February 11, 2017   | Excellence in Production Design for a Fantasy Film | Guy Hendrix Dyas                  | Won       | [55]    |\n| Golden Trailer Awards      | June 6, 2017        | Best Action                                        | Sony Pictures Entertainment       | Nominated | [56]    |\n| Golden Trailer Awards      | June 6, 2017        | Best Motion Poster                                 | Sony Pictures Entertainment       | Nominated | [56]    |\n| Saturn Awards              | June 28, 2017       | Best Science Fiction Film                          | Passengers                        | Nominated | [57]    |\n| Saturn Awards              | June 28, 2017       | Best Actor                                         | Chris Pratt                       | Nominated | [57]    |\n| Saturn Awards              | June 28, 2017       | Best Actress                                       | Jennifer Lawrence                 | Nominated | [57]    |\n| Saturn Awards              | June 28, 2017       | Best Music                                         | Thomas Newman                     | Nominated | [57]    |\n| Saturn Awards              | June 28, 2017       | Best Production Design                             | Guy Hendrix Dyas                  | Nominated | [57]    |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f g h Linden, Sheri (December 15, 2016). \"'Passengers': Film Review\".

The film follows two passengers on an interstellar spacecraft carrying thousands of people to a colony 120-years-traveling-distance from Earth, when the two are awakened 90 years early from their suspended hibernation.\n    </PlotSummary>\n    <Themes>Isolation, Love, Moral Dilemma</Themes>\n    <IntensityLevel>High</IntensityLevel>\n    <SpaceSetting>Interstellar spacecraft</SpaceSetting>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\nPassengers premiered at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles on December 14, 2016, and was released theatrically in the United States by Columbia Pictures on December 21, 2016. It received mixed reviews, with praise for Pratt's and Lawrence's performances, Thomas Newman's musical score, and its visual style and production values, but was criticized for its plot and characters. It grossed $304 million worldwide and was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Production Design at the 89th Academy Awards.\n\n<PlotSummary>\n    The Avalon, a sleeper ship transporting 5,000 colonists and 258 crew in hibernation pods, is traveling from Earth to the planet Homestead II, a 120-year journey as part of an exodus of Earth's population due to ecocide and the collapse of the biosphere. After only 30 years, an asteroid collision damages the ship, causing a malfunction that awakens passenger Jim Preston, a mechanical engineer, 90 years early. He is unable to return to hibernation, and cannot contact Earth for help due to an overly long communication delay. He attempts to break into the crew hibernation room, in the hopes they will be able to help. He fails due to the strength of the ship's security systems. As the ship's AI systems cannot seem to comprehend the idea of a hibernation pod malfunction (as it had never occurred before), he eventually gives up, passing the time in several of the ship's entertainment zones.\n</PlotSummary>\n\nAfter a year of isolation, with only an android barman named Arthur for company, Jim grows despondent and contemplates suicide, until he notices Aurora Lane, a beautiful young woman inside a pod. He considers reviving her for companionship, but struggles doing so, knowing it is morally wrong and will preclude her intended life on their destination planet. He eventually awakens her, letting her believe it was a malfunction. Devastated at having to live out her life on the ship, Aurora tries to reenter hibernation. Resigned to the situation, she begins writing about her experience. Over the next year, the two fall in love. Just before Jim intends to propose to Aurora, Arthur inadvertently reveals the truth about her awakening. Distraught and enraged, Aurora berates, shuns, and physically attacks Jim. She furiously rejects his apologies and avoids contact with him.\n\nSometime later, another pod failure awakens Gus Mancuso, a deck chief officer. Using Gus's employee code, the group gets on the bridge and discovers cascading failures in the ship's systems. If left unrepaired, the ship will fail, causing the passengers and crew to perish. When Gus falls critically ill, the ship's automated medical suite, the Autodoc, diagnoses pansystemic necrosis and gives him hours to live. Gus attributes it to his hibernation pod's multiple failures. Before dying, he gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge and employee code to get into crew-only areas.\n\nJim and Aurora find hull breaches from the asteroid collision two years earlier. The computer module administering the ship's fusion reactor power plant has been damaged, causing the cascading malfunctions as the other systems' computing power was diverted in an attempt to maintain it. They replace the damaged module but when the computer attempts to vent the reactor to extinguish a runaway plasma reaction, the exterior vent fails. Jim is forced to spacewalk and vent the plasma from outside, using the manual controls in the vent tube.\n\nJim discovers that he must remain in the tube to keep the vent open while Aurora initiates venting from inside the ship. Revealing her feelings for him, she admits she is terrified of losing him and being alone. Jim improvises a heat shield and survives the venting but is blasted into space as his tether snaps, and his damaged spacesuit begins losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves a clinically dead Jim from space and resuscitates him in the Autodoc. The Avalon, its reactor repaired, returns to normal operations.\n\nAfter burying Gus in space, Jim learns the Autodoc can function as a hibernation pod for one person, and he insists that Aurora use it for the remainder of the voyage. Realizing she would never see Jim again, she chooses to remain awake with him. Eighty-eight years later, the ship's crew awaken on schedule, shortly before arrival at Homestead II. In the ship's grand concourse, they discover a huge tree with trailing vines, lush vegetation, flying birds, and a small cabin. A recording of Aurora's story describes the wonderful life she and Jim shared on the Avalon.\n\n<Cast>\n    <Actor>Chris Pratt as Jim Preston, a mechanical engineer</Actor>\n    <Actor>Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane, a journalist and writer</Actor>\n    <Actor>Michael Sheen as Arthur, an android bartender on the Avalon</Actor>\n    <Actor>Laurence Fishburne as Gus Mancuso, the chief deck officer</Actor>\n    <Actor>Andy García as Captain Norris, commanding officer of the Avalon</Actor>\n</Cast>\n\n<Production>\n    <Development>\n        In Jon Spaihts's original 2007 script, Aurora's surname was Dunn. At one point in the film's development, it was set to star Keanu Reeves and Emily Blunt. Other actors temporarily attached to it included Reese Witherspoon and Rachel McAdams. Brian Kirk was originally set to make his feature directorial debut with Reeves in the lead. On December 5, 2014, it was announced that Sony Pictures Entertainment had won the rights to the film, and in early 2015, Morten Tyldum was chosen to direct. He had always wanted to do a big-scale sci-fi movie, but also stressed the importance of character development over effects.\n    </Development>\n</Production>\n\n<Reception>\n    <BoxOffice>\n        Passengers grossed $100 million in the United States and Canada and $203.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $303.1 million, against a net production budget of $110 million. It was the second-highest grossing original live-action Hollywood release of 2016, after La La Land.\n    </BoxOffice>\n    <CriticalResponse>\n        On Rotten Tomatoes, Passengers holds an approval rating of 30% based on 288 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Passengers proves Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together–and that even their chemistry isn't enough to overcome a fatally flawed story.\"\n    </CriticalResponse>\n</Reception>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly delineating the relevant attributes of the movie \"Passengers\" using the specified XML tags.",

He was reportedly taking great care to ensure that science was accurately depicted in this movie.\n\n- GoofsWalkie-talkies and cell phones are not allowed near a radio telescope array. They would overpower the array, making it useless.\n\n- QuotesAlien: You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.\n\n- Crazy credits\"For Carl\"\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Zaum - Andare a parare: Lo spazio dell'orbita (2011)\n\n- SoundtracksWho Needs Wings to Fly\nWritten by Dominic Frontiere and Sid Wayne\n\n### User reviews818\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Films are rarely as good as the bookbut there are exceptions to the rule\n\nThis remains true for this very good adaptation of the classic book by Carl Sagan. Sagans' idea was to make science and the elite commandeering of information available to the majority, he wrote his books for a wide audience and I think the film shows this as was intended by its author.\n\nThe Film is roughly about Dr Arroway, Ellie, and how she handles being alone in a world without family or close friends. It is metaphorically able to make us all think about how isolated we as a race, and as people can feel. \n\nEllie, a brilliant young scientist working on the mistrusted SETI program discovers a message sent to earth from distant star system Vega. On its discovery Ellie must battle with the Military, Pentagon, and Male Dominated scientific world to keep her cards on the table and her discovery that of her team. Ellie is constantly kept in the game by he benefactor, a rich technological industrialist mogul who has a vested interest in her participation of the programme to reach this alien culture.\n\nI don't wish to go on any further and spoil this movie as I rate it as a fantastic exploration of Science Vs Religion and the entire subsequent human spectrum in between. As a film there were several alterations from the book that I felt could have been included, for example not just one traveler but a range of them, philosophers, theologists, scientists, poets and Dr Arroway.\n\nI have watched this film a number of times and still find it a joy to watch the fifth, eighth and tenth time. Jody foster playing a not so dissimilar to her role in Silence of the lambs (attractive, clever, young, successful woman battling in a male world) is exceptional and delivers feeling and intellect alongside an impressive script.\n\nI would give this film an 8.5 and recommend it to anybody, but if you are a sci-fi fan and haven't seen this film then you're in for a treat.\n\n- gingerkris\n- Oct 21, 2004\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ25\n\n- How long is Contact?Powered by Alexa\n- What is 'Contact' about?\n- Is 'Contact' based on a book?\n- Where is Vega?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 16, 1997 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Warner Bros.

Realizing I had not seen this one yet, I managed to find it via the Kanopy streaming service through my public library's subscription.\n\nIt is not a mainstream movie, with a clear story and character motivations. It is a good watch for those who enjoy occasionally exploring alternative themes and filming styles. There is a vague opening, to suggest that an alien character has arrived and will explore Earth, in the process hunting down unsuspecting males. Scarlett Johansson plays the lead and is only known as \"The Female.\"\n\nAll filmed in Scotland, much of it outside towns and cities in the unusual and mostly beautiful countryside. There isn't much action, nor is there much dialog. The film is atmospheric and attractive, and when it ends it is very easy to think \"so what?\"\n\nI am glad I took the time to watch it but I will estimate that most lovers of clear-cut, mainstream movies will not enjoy it.\n\n- TxMike\n- Jan 24, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ20\n\n- How long is Under the Skin?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 29, 2014 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - Switzerland\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Bajo la piel\n- Filming locations\n    - Tantallon Castle, Auldhame, East Lothian, Scotland, UK(castle ruins)\n- Production companies\n    - Film4\n    - British Film Institute (BFI)\n    - Silver Reel\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $13,300,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $2,614,251\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $133,154\n    - Apr 6, 2014\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $7,494,387\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 48 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Under the Skin (2013) in Germany?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I think what most caught me surprised that it's so different from all the other scifi alien \"attacks\" movies - it's not all action all-guns-blazing at the threat - yet, rather a thoughtful humanity driven movie. Amy Adams is amazing as the protagonist demonstrating humanity as well communicating and befriending the aliens' unknown language and the impact it has on her. She carries the movie single-handed. I think it's a very beautiful message about humanity, what's the whole story is about. And tragic, surely, that despite knowing her future and the painful future she will have, she will not change anything. That's a great message. \"Despite knowing the journey, and where it leads... I embrace it... and I welcome every moment of it.\"\n\n- sini-200\n- Jul 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - November 10, 2016 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Canada\n- Official site\n    - Official Facebook Page\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Mandarin\n    - Russian\n- Also known as\n    - La llegada\n- Filming locations\n    - Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada\n- Production companies\n    - Lava Bear Films\n    - FilmNation Entertainment\n    - 21 Laps Entertainment\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $47,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $100,546,139\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $24,074,047\n    - Nov 13, 2016\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $212,758,656\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 56 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As you can imagine, a capitalist organization owning such a terrifying invention means there is a lot profit to be made from nasty bloody assassinations.\n\nI never watched Antiviral Cronenberg’s first film, which I remember getting a mixed critical reaction back in 2012 when it premiered. Without that context, I don’t feel equipped to say how much Cronenberg has grown as a filmmaker. That said, in the case of Possessor, I see a confident creator that never feels entrapped by the looming shadow of his father, the undisputed master of body horror. I would even go as far as to say that both the body horror and the gore elements in Possessor feel more effective and thematically cohesive than in some of his father’s films. And the thing that makes it a successful film in its own right is its deliberate attempt at using sci-fi conceits to create a separate reality that feels only slightly alien to our present day. Despite the existence of this nightmarish “possession” technology, the film’s world (an alternate 2008, according to the Wikipedia summary) is almost identical to ours. This is a society where corporations reign king and violent incidents are continuously covered by a dense fog of meaninglessness, dubious financial interests, media misinformation, and dense conspiracies. Reality in the film always feels off, closer to a slow burn nightmare than a traditional thriller or a horror film. And it’s this clever atmospheric trick that helps the film convey, in effective ways, modern labor alienation and our increasing detachment from the systems that control global politics and our intimate relations.\n\nMost of the film’s runtime centers on the planned assassination of the CEO of a data mining company. Tasya Vos, the main character, is tasked with possessing the body of Colin, the CEO’s daughter’s boyfriend holding a menial low-ranking position at the company. In one of the most interesting scenes in the film, the camera follows Colin’s typical routine as a data miner. We see him enter a bare room filled with workers wearing VR headsets. The set takes workers inside a virtual replica of a corporate office. After starting the fake desktop computer inside the virtual office, Colin spends several minutes cataloguing the type, color, and shape of drapes present in the background of random videos. A random couple is having graphic sex on a bed (is it a porn film? Or a video illegally recorded inside someone’s house?) while Colin zooms in to a corner in order to have a better look at some ugly drapes.\n\nI find it kind of amusing that a lot of people were baffled after watching the sequence described above. Some reviews I watched on YouTube (Scaredy Cats’s and Red Letter Media’s come to mind) were surprised and even expressed doubts about the existence of data mining. Let me tell you, that means this is some good sci-fi. Why? Because the best sci-fi stories are the ones that take outlandish things from our present, and just slightly exaggerates them for stylistic purposes. At the same time, reactions to this part of the film revealed two things to me. First, that is obvious these YouTubers are not currently in the job market (or desperate enough to earn a few bucks on the side doing whatever they can find). And second, that this was solid proof that most people ignore the bizarre and surreal mechanisms, and the types of jobs, that keep the Internet functional.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nData mining is central to tech. Data mining is the future of human labor. These days, one of the most lucrative businesses you can invest in or own is a “consulting” company whose only purpose is to hire low-paid workers around the world to feed algorithms, usually at the behest of some tech company. Some of these jobs are pretty straightforward: maybe you get to transcribe ads or newspaper articles, or maybe you end up transcribing voice recordings. The idea is this data will be used to improve smartphone apps aimed at disabled people or later used in the creation of innovative software. Maybe. Most of the time, however, these jobs demand tasks that get incredibly abstract and strange. It’s all hard to gauge since there is a severe lack of transparency in this industry. Maybe you will become a social media “tagger” that allows machine-learning algorithms to read the “sharing” potential of Facebook posts. Or record videos of your dog for some shady Chinese company. Or take hundreds of pictures of your clothes in different backgrounds for a new fashion app. Or place your iPad in different rooms in your house and record videos of the process. You might have to record yourself repeating nonsensical linguistic queues and phonetic gibberish, so voice-based virtual assistants understand different world accents. I lack the evidence to prove this, but I’m convinced 60% of this data is probably sold to the FBI or the CIA for general surveillance records.\n\nI know a lot about data mining because I’ve spent close to a year working for these companies. I can tell you, without a shred of doubt, that those are the most demeaning and alienating jobs I’ve ever had in my sad pathetic life. That said, from the perspective of predatory monstrous capitalists, I can see the appeal. That is, of course, if you’re willing to try and understand the minds of exploitative sociopaths. These companies pretend to give you a contract, but the thing is mostly a symbolic gesture. Truth is, data mining is good business because you can hire anyone anywhere these days, and data mining jobs demand little to no skills, so these companies are not tied to local or regional labor laws. They offer no benefits, workers have to provide all materials necessary for the job (computer, internet service, and so forth), and it’s legal to pay less than the US minimum wage. In fact, many of the tasks fall into grey areas, since certain technologies or data are treated as “scientific” data. This means even your 12-year-old nephew and your grandpa can participate in the wondrous world of data. And you can get a fancy bullshit job title, such as “social media evaluator” and “Content Rater” or something.\n\nIf I can offer one criticism to Possessor is that the film doesn’t go far enough in showing how dehumanizing data mining really is. If anything, the fictional company portrayed on the film is, all things considered, slightly better than the real job conditions of this industry. Workers in the film have to physically go to a real building! They have restrooms and a worker’s lounge! The company even has the decency of giving you a fake virtual office! I’m not the first to speculate that the future of labor is the dreaded Home Office, a trend that has and is currently accelerating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Capitalist analysts are already estimating a considerable shift to the home office model in the next thirty years and the signs were already there in the stupid idea of “telecommute” popular in Silicon Valley a few years back. In these rapid shifts, I really believe global transnational data mining was the experimental phase of a whole new development.\n\nOne of the key concepts introduced by Karl Marx was labor alienation. As commodity production became faster and more complex, workers were slowly disconnected from whatever objects they produced. The invention and spread of factories in late capitalism meant production became series of series, construction of “things” that were part of larger “things” that were then sold and consumed. It’s the main difference between a shoemaker making a pair of shoes and a factory worker making screws used in war tanks. The former form of labor is clear, the skilled technician sees the process from beginning to end and “owns” his labor. In the latter, the worker becomes increasingly detached from the end product that is assembled through his labor. Data mining is the most extreme and abstract version of this alienation.\n\nBack in the old days, workers at least had some degree of certainty of their role in a chain of production. They knew they worked for Screw Company X and, maybe, some day, they would see on the news the tanks that were built with the screws they made. In data mining world, there are additional layers of abstraction and you’re never sure where the data is going or what its main purpose really is. Most projects are buried under piles and piles of NDAs and vague information. Usually, it’s impossible to even know what company hired you since you’re trapped in multiple layers of subcontracting businesses. One time, for a project, I had to install software in my computer that blocked the use of external USB hard drives for six months for security purposes. All of this towards an unknown goal. I like to think that maybe the hours I put into these tasks, for literal pennies, ended, perhaps, used in some weird algorithm. Maybe my hard work helped Susan, soccer mom from Connecticut addicted to benzos, save 2.13 seconds while Google searching her hubby’s favorite brand of spicy chocolate bars.\n\nIn a recent interview, Cronenberg explained he wrote and conceived Possessor during a depressive episode in his life when he felt as if he was living the life of “someone else.” Thus, you could argue the film is about that type of mindset. The idea that we engage in a human performance for so long that we stop being ourselves. The film’s story works as a broad enough metaphor that you can project these themes onto it. Still, I think the film works better, and says something far more interesting, when you interpret it as a commentary on labor alienation. I think this angle is the only possible reading that cohesively integrates all the character threads with the data mining subplot.\n\nThroughout the story, the film poses that Vos and Colin are not that different. Vos assassinates people for a capitalist organization that actively encourages her to give away all of her human ties, including her ex-husband and son, while hiding the political and economic reasons behind the assassinations. The agenda and end goals of the company are never fully revealed besides vague hints in a couple of dialogue scenes. Similarly, we never find out the purpose of the data Colin is collecting. The structures of power dictating their lives tell Vos to choose the suppression of her identity, emotions, and humanity to be the best at her job. Colin, on the other hand, is trapped in a nonsense job because of his girlfriend’s vague promises that working as a data miner is the only path for him to gain the respect of her shitty rich father. The thesis at the center of the gruesome climax is that we have secretly internalized capitalism’s promises to such an extent that, yes, it is worthwhile, desirable even, to destroy and sacrifice everything you have and are in order to excel at your job. I mean, be honest, don’t you want to be really good at your job? Isn’t that the only purpose in life?\n\nStray note on home office people:\n\nA specific kind of person I particularly hate is the type that made their life goal to be a “proud home office worker.” The one that tells you to your face that they worked for years to work from home and free themselves from commute hell. Although is true that commute is integral to alienation, the idea that most of your existence is working or heading/returning from your job as an exercise in futility and dehumanization, I do think home office and telecommuting just exacerbates those problems. The point is not that traffic, a crumbling infrastructure, or your shitty car are the problem, but that work dominates most of your conscious life. In this sense, the idea of home office is next level shit eating, because you’re willingly letting your job into your intimate spaces. Now, you have “flexibility,” you can move anywhere you want and live a healthy life. That’s the dream, right? Or perhaps, and the pandemic is making this really clear, these new modes of labor are just pathways for your job to enter and control the place you call home? You can fly to the Caribbean or Cancún or do ayahuasca in Perú, but your job, your stupid laptop, and your boss will be there, always, hovering above you and never going away until you retire or die.\n\nDo you enjoy reading my essays?

That said, in the case of <Name>Possessor</Name>, I see a confident creator that never feels entrapped by the looming shadow of his father, the undisputed master of body horror. I would even go as far as to say that both the body horror and the gore elements in <Name>Possessor</Name> feel more effective and thematically cohesive than in some of his father’s films.</p>\n        \n        <p>And the thing that makes it a successful film in its own right is its deliberate attempt at using sci-fi conceits to create a separate reality that feels only slightly alien to our present day. Despite the existence of this nightmarish “possession” technology, the film’s world (an alternate 2008, according to the Wikipedia summary) is almost identical to ours. This is a society where corporations reign king and violent incidents are continuously covered by a dense fog of meaninglessness, dubious financial interests, media misinformation, and dense conspiracies. Reality in the film always feels off, closer to a slow burn nightmare than a traditional thriller or a horror film. And it’s this clever atmospheric trick that helps the film convey, in effective ways, modern labor alienation and our increasing detachment from the systems that control global politics and our intimate relations.</p>\n        \n        <p>Most of the film’s runtime centers on the planned assassination of the CEO of a data mining company. Tasya Vos, the main character, is tasked with possessing the body of Colin, the CEO’s daughter’s boyfriend holding a menial low-ranking position at the company. In one of the most interesting scenes in the film, the camera follows Colin’s typical routine as a data miner. We see him enter a bare room filled with workers wearing VR headsets. The set takes workers inside a virtual replica of a corporate office. After starting the fake desktop computer inside the virtual office, Colin spends several minutes cataloguing the type, color, and shape of drapes present in the background of random videos. A random couple is having graphic sex on a bed (is it a porn film? Or a video illegally recorded inside someone’s house?) while Colin zooms in to a corner in order to have a better look at some ugly drapes.</p>\n        \n        <p>I find it kind of amusing that a lot of people were baffled after watching the sequence described above. Some reviews I watched on YouTube (Scaredy Cats’s and Red Letter Media’s come to mind) were surprised and even expressed doubts about the existence of data mining. Let me tell you, that means this is some good sci-fi. Why? Because the best sci-fi stories are the ones that take outlandish things from our present, and just slightly exaggerates them for stylistic purposes. At the same time, reactions to this part of the film revealed two things to me. First, that is obvious these YouTubers are not currently in the job market (or desperate enough to earn a few bucks on the side doing whatever they can find). And second, that this was solid proof that most people ignore the bizarre and surreal mechanisms, and the types of jobs, that keep the Internet functional.</p>\n        \n        <p><Additional Information>Data mining is central to tech. Data mining is the future of human labor. These days, one of the most lucrative businesses you can invest in or own is a “consulting” company whose only purpose is to hire low-paid workers around the world to feed algorithms, usually at the behest of some tech company. Some of these jobs are pretty straightforward: maybe you get to transcribe ads or newspaper articles, or maybe you end up transcribing voice recordings. The idea is this data will be used to improve smartphone apps aimed at disabled people or later used in the creation of innovative software. Maybe. Most of the time, however, these jobs demand tasks that get incredibly abstract and strange. It’s all hard to gauge since there is a severe lack of transparency in this industry.</Additional Information></p>\n        \n        <p>I know a lot about data mining because I’ve spent close to a year working for these companies. I can tell you, without a shred of doubt, that those are the most demeaning and alienating jobs I’ve ever had in my sad pathetic life. That said, from the perspective of predatory monstrous capitalists, I can see the appeal. That is, of course, if you’re willing to try and understand the minds of exploitative sociopaths. These companies pretend to give you a contract, but the thing is mostly a symbolic gesture. Truth is, data mining is good business because you can hire anyone anywhere these days, and data mining jobs demand little to no skills, so these companies are not tied to local or regional labor laws. They offer no benefits, workers have to provide all materials necessary for the job (computer, internet service, and so forth), and it’s legal to pay less than the US minimum wage.</p>\n        \n        <p>If I can offer one criticism to <Name>Possessor</Name> is that the film doesn’t go far enough in showing how dehumanizing data mining really is. If anything, the fictional company portrayed on the film is, all things considered, slightly better than the real job conditions of this industry. Workers in the film have to physically go to a real building! They have restrooms and a worker’s lounge! The company even has the decency of giving you a fake virtual office! I’m not the first to speculate that the future of labor is the dreaded Home Office, a trend that has and is currently accelerating during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n        \n        <p>One of the key concepts introduced by Karl Marx was labor alienation. As commodity production became faster and more complex, workers were slowly disconnected from whatever objects they produced. The invention and spread of factories in late capitalism meant production became series of series, construction of “things” that were part of larger “things” that were then sold and consumed. It’s the main difference between a shoemaker making a pair of shoes and a factory worker making screws used in war tanks. The former form of labor is clear, the skilled technician sees the process from beginning to end and “owns” his labor. In the latter, the worker becomes increasingly detached from the end product that is assembled through his labor. Data mining is the most extreme and abstract version of this alienation.</p>\n        \n        <p>Back in the old days, workers at least had some degree of certainty of their role in a chain of production. They knew they worked for Screw Company X and, maybe, some day, they would see on the news the tanks that were built with the screws they made. In data mining world, there are additional layers of abstraction and you’re never sure where the data is going or what its main purpose really is. Most projects are buried under piles and piles of NDAs and vague information. Usually, it’s impossible to even know what company hired you since you’re trapped in multiple layers of subcontracting businesses.</p>\n        \n        <p>In a recent interview, <Director>Cronenberg</Director> explained he wrote and conceived <Name>Possessor</Name> during a depressive episode in his life when he felt as if he was living the life of “someone else.” Thus, you could argue the film is about that type of mindset. The idea that we engage in a human performance for so long that we stop being ourselves. The film’s story works as a broad enough metaphor that you can project these themes onto it. Still, I think the film works better, and says something far more interesting, when you interpret it as a commentary on labor alienation.</p>\n        \n        <p>Throughout the story, the film poses that Vos and Colin are not that different. Vos assassinates people for a capitalist organization that actively encourages her to give away all of her human ties, including her ex-husband and son, while hiding the political and economic reasons behind the assassinations. The agenda and end goals of the company are never fully revealed besides vague hints in a couple of dialogue scenes. Similarly, we never find out the purpose of the data Colin is collecting. The structures of power dictating their lives tell Vos to choose the suppression of her identity, emotions, and humanity to be the best at her job. Colin, on the other hand, is trapped in a nonsense job because of his girlfriend’s vague promises that working as a data miner is the only path for him to gain the respect of her shitty rich father.</p>\n        \n        <p>The thesis at the center of the gruesome climax is that we have secretly internalized capitalism’s promises to such an extent that, yes, it is worthwhile, desirable even, to destroy and sacrifice everything you have and are in order to excel at your job. I mean, be honest, don’t you want to be really good at your job? Isn’t that the only purpose in life?</p>\n        \n        <p>Stray note on home office people:</p>\n        \n        <p>A specific kind of person I particularly hate is the type that made their life goal to be a “proud home office worker.” The one that tells you to your face that they worked for years to work from home and free themselves from commute hell. Although is true that commute is integral to alienation, the idea that most of your existence is working or heading/returning from your job as an exercise in futility and dehumanization, I do think home office and telecommuting just exacerbates those problems.</p>\n        \n        <p>Do you enjoy reading my essays? I have a Substack now in case you need to bypass Medium’s paywall and want to support my writing. You can also follow me on Twitter where I’m usually complaining about politics and anime.</p>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly delineating the relevant attributes of the movie \"Possessor\" using the specified XML tags.",

                "Plot Summary": "In an alternate 2008, <b>Tasya Vos</b> is an assassin who takes control of other people's bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos' consciousness is inserted into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of the job, although the movie's intro sequence has her deviate from her protocol and struggling to commit suicide by her own gun, getting the host shot by shooting at arriving police forces instead. Vos struggles with neurological symptoms and increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, <b>Michael</b>, and son, <b>Ira</b>. She 'practices' assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael. Vos' handler, retired assassin <b>Girder</b>, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it. Despite her fragile mental state and fatigue, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO <b>John Parse</b> and his daughter, <b>Ava</b>, by possessing Ava's fiancé, <b>Colin Tate</b>. While assuming the host's life, the neurological symptoms worsen, but Vos hides this during her handler's check-ins. The hit is only a partial success as Ava dies, but not Parse. Vos attempts to finish the job per protocol by forcing Tate to shoot himself, but again cannot make him pull the trigger. During a dissociative break, in which Vos struggles to remain in control of Tate's body, he stabs himself in the skull, damaging the implant and causing severe neurological symptoms on Vos' own body, causing her internal physical damage. Vos discovers she can neither leave Tate's body, nor overpower his consciousness. Tate regains control, but is severely disoriented, in shock and traumatized from the violence before him, so he flees the crime scene. He seeks refuge with his friend <b>Reeta</b>, while experiencing fragmented memories of Vos' life. He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava. <b>Eddie</b>, a co-employee from Tate's workplace who reveals himself to be a plant from Vos' agency, arrives at the apartment to help Vos regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails and Tate kills Eddie during another dissociative episode in which Tate becomes aware of Vos' presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child, and home. Tate goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. Vos appears inside Tate’s mind and goads Tate into killing Michael. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver, in a similar manner as the movie's opening sequence's job. Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, killing him, also reminiscent to the opening sequence's stabbing. Vos uses Tate's last moments to shoot Ira dead, who is then revealed to also have been a host. Vos returns to her own body and discovers that it was Girder who had taken control of Ira. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, as Girder wanted. In another debriefing, Vos sorts through her personal objects again. She contemplates and recognizes the butterfly, but does not express any guilt for killing it. Girder smiles and replies, 'Very good.'",

Here’s how it works.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Chronological order\n- Release order\n\nLet's get tactical marines, as we run through the Alien movies in order, both chronologically and by release date. After having watched Alien: Romulus and as we eagerly await Noah Hawley’s Alien TV series, the Xenomorph lurks on streaming.\n\nIf you're a newcomer and need some guidance, or simply want a quick refresher, here’s our list of all the Alien movies in order (chronologically and by release date), including the two Alien vs. Predator flicks. If you're based in the US, you can watch the entire franchise on Hulu, while it's all on Disney+ if you're in the UK.\n\nThe Alien movie franchise has evolved and expanded over the years in unexpected ways, already packing seven “solo” installments (six if you don’t count Prometheus) and two Alien vs. Predator crossover entries in which the fearsome Xenomorphs faced the most famous spacefaring hunters of all time. On top of that, video games and comic books have been keeping the IP alive by doing their own thing, often putting out stories that are more interesting and fitting than the later movies.\n\nUnlike the Predator movies timeline, the Alien franchise is a mess if you want to unify all entries, as some events and pieces of the mythos contradict each other in big ways. However, what it lacks in cohesiveness, it makes up for in personality – each filmmaker’s stamp is all over these movies. We’re also leaving out whatever video games and comics had to say, or else this article would be twice as long and dense.\n\n- 'Alien: Earth': Release window, plot, cast &amp;amp; everything we know\n- Star Trek movies in order: Chronological and release\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf the Alien vs. Predator talk (and potential rewatches) you find below gets you in the mood for more Xenomorph-driven horror, be sure to check out our list of the Alien movies, ranked.

Alien vs. Predator\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: August 13, 2004\n- Cast: Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen\n\nAfter a failed AvP project which was developed in the 90s, Shane Salerno’s script set the action in (back then) present day: 2004. An expedition led by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) wants to investigate a massive heat signal under the ice on Bouvetøya, an island off the coast of Antarctica. What comes afterwards is a chaotic battle between long-dormant Xenomorphs and three Predator hunters, with humans caught in the middle.\n\nAs the first Alien vs. Predator crossover movie, AvP tries really hard to connect both franchises, especially with the inclusion of Aliens veteran Lance Henriksen as the founder of Weyland Industries (which later becomes Weyland-Yutani after a merger). However, it put the origins of the Xenomorphs – as presented by Alien (1979) – into question, and Ridley Scott’s prequel movies later trashed the entire idea of Xenos existing this early in the timeline. Furthermore, a major flashback set in the early days of human civilization shows that both species have been going at it for an awfully long time.\n\n## 2. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: December 25, 2007\n- Cast: Steven Pasquale, Reiko Aylesworth, John Ortiz\n\n20th Century Fox’s (now Studios) second go at AvP was met with abysmal reviews and a cold shoulder from most fans, although it delivered enough unrestrained nastiness and refreshing in-universe concepts to get diehard fans talking. AvP: Requiem is set in 2004 too, starting right after the previous movie cuts to black. There are notable differences between the theatrical cut and the extended one (which is the way to go), but the main events remain unchanged in the latter.\n\nThis movie keeps pushing the idea of everything in both franchises happening in one big timeline, and ends up tying Yutani Corp’s huge space travel advancements we see in the Alien movies to Predator tech. This ain’t canon anymore for the Alien franchise, but as mentioned before, the AvP movies have been embraced by the Predator timeline. As bad as the movie is, the Yutani nod was a cool note to end on.\n\n## 3. Prometheus\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: June 1, 2012\n- Cast: Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron\n\nThe first of the Alien prequels by original director Ridley Scott starts in 2089 (prologue aside), with archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discovering an ancient star map on Earth that sends them – backed by the Weyland Corporation – to the distant moon LV-223, where they arrive in December 2093.\n\nWhile Xenomorphs as we know them don’t show up in this movie, we learned tons about their makers – referred to as Engineers – and their connection to humankind. The sci-fi rules of all the chaos and horror that ensue are confusing to say the least, but Scott and his team made one thing clear: the classic Xenomorph didn’t exist at this point, instantly vaporizing both AvP movies out of the timeline.\n\nIn a hilarious move, the upcoming TV series, which Scott is producing and actively working on, appears to be playing the same card and trashing his take on the Xenos’ origin, as it will take place on Earth “in the near future.” Continuity? They don’t know her.\n\n## 4. Alien: Covenant\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: May 12, 2017\n- Cast: Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup\n\nOnce again, the second Alien prequel kicks off with a distant prologue which teases future events and discoveries. The story itself takes place in the year 2104, 11 years after the Prometheus expedition went missing. The colonization ship Covenant is en route to the planet Origae-6, but a mysterious transmission of a human voice makes the crew look for answers in a nearby planet with Earth-like characteristics.\n\nWhile Ridley Scott still showed more interest in everything that wasn’t the actual Xenomorph, there’s plenty of classic Alien goodness in Covenant, finally giving the nightmarish creatures a clear origin which, as mentioned before, doesn’t vibe with the AvP flicks. Sadly, the third movie of the trilogy will probably never happen following a disappointing box office haul, and Covenant’s ending is anything but close to leading into the crashed Engineer ship found in the original Alien.\n\nAlien: Covenant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.4/10\n\n## 5. Alien\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: May 25, 1979\n- Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt\n\nThe events of the original horror masterpiece take place in 2122, which puts only 18 years between it and Covenant. Of course, this being the movie that started it all, everything in Alien stands on its own. There’s a big mystery, plenty of scares and gore, and little more. The worldbuilding is intriguing but slim, and we learn early on that Weyland-Yutani was actively seeking the strange and lethal Xenomorph.\n\nIf we accept Scott’s intent and try to work his Alien prequels into the original canon, we have to assume that, at some point in between Covenant and this movie, the company learned about the existence of the Xenomorph and the Engineers, either through a survivor of whatever happened afterwards or via remote transmission. Also, a group of Engineers from another planet or moon – since the synth David (Michael Fassbender) massacred an entire planet before creating the monster – got their hands on plenty of eggs and then crashed on LV-426. If everyone involved wanted to tie things up nicely, these events would’ve been the backbone of the prequel trilogy’s conclusion. But alas…\n\n## 6. Alien: Romulus\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: August 16, 2024\n- Cast: Cailee Spaeny, Isabela Merced, David Jonsson\n\nAlien: Romulus takes place in 2142. Weyland-Yutani got its hands on the dangerous Xenomorphs and ran experiments on them in a space station. Enter the cast of young characters, who board said space station to steal some highly-regulated equipment. Of course, things get ugly fast, but the movie revealed a far more sinister mystery than just Xenomorphs that broke containment.\n\nThe story kicks off with a shuttle from Weyland-Yutani retrieving a Xenomorph cocoon from the debris left by the Nostromo’s explosion in the first Alien movie. Yup, the unwanted alien passenger that slaughtered the Nostromo’s crew simply stayed alive, asleep and adrift in outer space until someone found it. Without getting into further plot details, Romulus ends in a way that doesn’t break the basic premise of Aliens, which is that Weyland-Yutani continues to look for Xenomorphs and risks an entire colony years later.\n\n## 7. Aliens\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: July 18, 1986\n- Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn\n\n57 years after the events of Alien, in 2179, the sole survivor of the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is rescued in deep space and debriefed by her employers, who seem skeptical about her claims. To make matters worse, LV-426 is now the site of a large terraforming colony. And of course, some poor employees eventually come across the massive derelict ship full of dormant Xenomorph eggs.\n\nThough there are some obvious ellipses happening early on, the entire story plays out during the year 2179, which suggests that Ripley is brought to a Weyland-Yutani station close nearby after she’s rescued, and that LV-426 isn’t too far away either. And it all makes sense, since the Nostromo never got too far from the planetoid in the first movie before Ripley destroyed it and went for a long nap inside the shuttle Narcissus, which just drifted away for more than half a century.\n\n## 8. Alien 3\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: May 22, 1992\n- Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance\n\nAlien 3 begins shortly after Ripley, Newt (Carrie Henn), Hicks (Michael Biehn), and the damaged android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) enter cryonic stasis. In one of the darkest movie starts of all time, Ripley crash-lands and finds herself trapped in a claustrophobic prison on Fiorina “Fury” 161, a barren world. Of course, the Xenomorphs had something to do with that, and the nightmare follows her down to the hellish planet.\n\nThe entire movie takes place in 2179, which means the post-Aliens nap was extremely short and that everything in David Fincher’s off-beat and smaller threequel happens rather fast. A major question mark that still causes heated debate among fans is the appearance of Bishop’s creator (both played by Lance Henriksen), who doesn’t seem too bothered by some grave injuries he sustains in the climax. Was he the real Michael Weyland or just a more elaborate synth designed to fool her into giving up the Xenomorph?\n\n## 9. Alien: Resurrection\n\n(Image credit: 20th Century Studios)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Release date: November 12, 1997\n- Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman\n\nAlien: Resurrection made the biggest time jump in the franchise, distancing itself from Weyland-Yutani and that entire storyline. It’s set in the year 2381, 202 years after the death of Ellen Ripley and the last known Xenomorph. One would think the franchise would take advantage of the situation to swap Sigourney Weaver’s character for a new lead, but nope – she’s cloned, alongside the embryo of a Xenomorph Queen, using blood samples taken before her death by Jonathan Clemens (Charles Dance).\n\nThe entire premise (and development) of Joss Whedon’s script was quite the ride, and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s sensibilities only made Resurrection even weirder, but it’s nonetheless a fascinating look into a far future of the Alien universe which somehow feels even more depressing and dire than the classic Weyland-Yutani era.\n\n## Alien movies in release order\n\n- Alien (1979)\n- Aliens (1986)\n- Alien 3 (1992)\n- Alien: Resurrection (1997)\n- Alien vs. Predator (2004)\n- Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)\n- Prometheus (2012)\n- Alien: Covenant (2017)\n- Alien: Romulus (2024)\n\nWatch the Alien movies on Hulu if you're in the U.S.\n\nGet first month fr...\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHulu - Monthly (with Ads)\n\n/mth\n\nGet First Month Fr...\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHulu (No Ads)\n\n/mth\n\nWatch the Alien movies on Disney+ if you're in the U.K.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDisney+ Annual Premium\n\n/year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDisney+ Bundle Duo Basic\n\n/mth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDisney+ Bundle Trio Basic\n\n/mth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

An expedition led by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) wants to investigate a massive heat signal under the ice on Bouvetøya, an island off the coast of Antarctica. What comes afterwards is a chaotic battle between long-dormant Xenomorphs and three Predator hunters, with humans caught in the middle.</PlotSummary>\n        <AdditionalInformation>As the first Alien vs. Predator crossover movie, AvP tries really hard to connect both franchises, especially with the inclusion of Aliens veteran Lance Henriksen as the founder of Weyland Industries (which later becomes Weyland-Yutani after a merger).

The manga, first serialized between 1989 and 1991, is set in mid-21st century Japan and tells the story of the fictional counter-cyberterrorist organization Public Security Section 9, led by protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi.\n\nAnimation studio Production I.G has produced several anime adaptations of the series. These include the 1995 film of the same name and its 2004 sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence; the 2002 television series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and its 2020 follow-up, Ghost in the Shell: SAC\\_2045; and the Ghost in the Shell: Arise original video animation series. In addition, an American-produced live-action film was released on March 2017.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Title\n\nThe original editor Koichi Yuri says: At first, Ghost in the Shell came from Shirow, but when Yuri asked \"something more flashy\", Shirow came up with \"攻殻機動隊 Koukaku Kidou Tai (Shell Squad)\" for Yuri. But Shirow was attached to including \"Ghost in the Shell\" as well even if in smaller type.[1]\n\n### Setting\n\nPrimarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional Japanese city of Niihama, Niihama Prefecture (新浜県新浜市, Niihama-ken Niihama-shi),[b] otherwise known as New Port City (ニューポートシティ, Nyū Pōto Shiti), the manga and the many anime adaptations follow the members of Public Security Section 9, a task-force consisting of various professionals skilled at solving and preventing crime, mostly with some sort of police background. Political intrigue and counter-terrorism operations are standard fare for Section 9, but the various actions of corrupt officials, companies, and cyber-criminals in each scenario are unique and require the diverse skills of Section 9's staff to prevent a series of incidents from escalating.\n\nIn this post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prostheses, with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg. The main character of Ghost in the Shell, Major Motoko Kusanagi, is such a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required her to use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to attacks from highly skilled hackers, with the most dangerous being those who will hack a person to bend to their whims.\n\n## Media\n\n### Literature\n\n#### Original manga\n\nThe original Ghost in the Shell manga ran in Japan from April 1989 to November 1990 in Kodansha's manga anthology Young Magazine, and was released in a tankōbon volume on October 2, 1991.[2] Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface followed in 1997 for 9 issues in Young Magazine, and was collected in the Ghost in the Shell: Solid Box on December 1, 2000.[3] Then a standard version with modifications and new pages was published on June 26, 2001.[4] Four stories from Man-Machine Interface that were not released in tankobon format from previous releases were later collected in Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor, and published by Kodansha on July 17, 2003.[5] Several art books have also been published for the manga.\n\n### Films\n\n#### Animated films\n\nTwo animated films based on the original manga have been released, both directed by Mamoru Oshii and animated by Production I.G. Ghost in the Shell was released in 1995 and follows the \"Puppet Master\" storyline from the manga. It was re-released in 2008 as Ghost in the Shell 2.0 with new audio and updated 3D computer graphics in certain scenes.[6] Innocence, otherwise known as Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, was released in 2004, with its story based on a chapter from the first manga.\n\n#### Live-action film\n\nIn 2008, DreamWorks and producer Steven Spielberg acquired the rights to a live-action film adaptation of the original Ghost in the Shell manga.[7] On January 24, 2014, Rupert Sanders was announced as director, with a screenplay by William Wheeler.[8] In April 2016, the full cast was announced, which included Juliette Binoche, Chin Han, Lasarus Ratuere and Kaori Momoi, and Scarlett Johansson in the lead role;[9] the casting of Johansson drew accusations of whitewashing.[10][11][12][13] Principal photography on the film began on location in Wellington, New Zealand, on February 1, 2016. Filming wrapped in June 2016.[14] Ghost in the Shell premiered in Tokyo on March 16, 2017, and was released in the United States on March 31, 2017, in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D.[15] It received mixed reviews, with praise for its visuals and Johansson's performance but criticism for its script.[16][17]\n\n### Television\n\n#### Stand Alone Complex TV series, film and ONA\n\nIn 2002, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex premiered on Animax, presenting a new telling of Ghost in the Shell independent from the original manga, focusing on Section 9's investigation of the Laughing Man hacker.[18] It was followed in 2004 by a second season titled Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG, which focused on the Individual Eleven terrorist group.[19] The primary storylines of both seasons were compressed into OVAs broadcast as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex The Laughing Man in 2005 and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Individual Eleven in 2006.[20][21] Also in 2006, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society, featuring Section 9's confrontation with a hacker known as the Puppeteer, was broadcast, serving as a finale to the anime series.[22] The extensive score for the series and its films was composed by Yoko Kanno.[23]\n\nOn April 7, 2017, Kodansha and Production I.G announced that Kenji Kamiyama and Shinji Aramaki would be co-directing a new Kōkaku Kidōtai anime production.[24] On December 7, 2018, it was reported by Netflix that they had acquired the worldwide streaming rights to the original net animation (ONA) anime series, titled Ghost in the Shell: SAC\\_2045, and that it would premiere on April 23, 2020. The series is in 3DCG and Sola Digital Arts collaborated with Production I.G on the project. Ilya Kuvshinov handled character designs.[25]  The series had two seasons of 12 episodes each.[26]\n\nIn addition to the anime, a series of published books, two separate manga adaptations, and several video games for consoles and mobile phones have been released for Stand Alone Complex.\n\n#### Arise OVA, TV series and film\n\nIn 2013, a new iteration of the series titled Ghost in the Shell: Arise premiered, taking an original look at the Ghost in the Shell world, set before the original manga. It was released as a series of four original video animation (OVA) episodes (with limited theatrical releases) from 2013 to 2014, then recompiled as a 10-episode television series under the title of Kōkaku Kidōtai: Arise - Alternative Architecture. An additional fifth OVA titled Pyrophoric Cult, originally premiering in the Alternative Architecture broadcast as two original episodes, was released on August 26, 2015.[27] Kazuchika Kise served as the chief director of the series, with Tow Ubukata as head writer.[28] Cornelius was brought onto the project to compose the score for the series, with the Major's new voice actress Maaya Sakamoto also providing vocals for certain tracks.\n\nGhost in the Shell: The New Movie, also known as Ghost in the Shell: Arise − The Movie or New Ghost in the Shell, is a 2015 film directed by Kazuya Nomura that serves as a finale to the Ghost in the Shell: Arise story arc. The film is a continuation to the plot of the Pyrophoric Cult episode of Arise, and ties up loose ends from that arc.\n\nA manga adaptation was serialized in Kodansha's Young Magazine, which started on March 13 and ended on August 26, 2013.[29][30]\n\n### 2026 anime\n\nOn May 25, 2024, it was announced that a new anime television series adaptation will be produced by Science Saru for a 2026 premiere.[31] Saru will be in a production committee with Bandai Namco Filmworks, Kodansha and Production I.G.[32]\n\n### Video games\n\nGhost in the Shell was developed by Exact and released for the PlayStation on July 17, 1997, in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment.[33] It is a third-person shooter featuring an original storyline where the character plays a rookie member of Section 9. The video game's soundtrack Megatech Body features various techno artists, such as Takkyu Ishino, Scan X and Mijk Van Dijk.[34]\n\nSeveral video games were also developed to tie into the Stand Alone Complex television series, in addition to a first-person shooter by Nexon and Neople titled Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online, released in 2016.[35]\n\nA virtual reality game entitled Ghost in the Shell Arise: Stealth Hounds, was made available at Bandai Namco's arcade VR Zone Shinjuku in 2017. [36][37]\n\n## Legacy\n\nGhost in the Shell influenced some prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of The Matrix and its sequels, showed it to producer Joel Silver, saying, \"We wanna do that for real.\"[38] The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which was inspired by the opening credits of Ghost in the Shell, and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's Avatar, Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Jonathan Mostow's Surrogates. James Cameron cited Ghost in the Shell as a source of inspiration,[39] citing it as an influence on Avatar.[40]\n\nBungie's 2001 third-person action game Oni draws substantial inspiration from Ghost in the Shell's setting and characters.[41][42] Ghost in the Shell also influenced video games such as the Metal Gear Solid series,[43] Deus Ex,[44] and Cyberpunk 2077.[45][46]\n\n## Explanatory notes\n\n- ^ Known in Japan as Kōkaku Kidōtai (Japanese: 攻殻機動隊, lit. \"Mobile Armored Riot Police\")\n- ^ There is a real-world Niihama, located in Ehime Prefecture, but its name is written differently in kanji: 新居浜市.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Official Log 1\".

Shot over five days with almost unknown cast (except maybe Nicholas Brendon from 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') and mostly improvised scenes and dialogue. The writers (director James Ward Byrkit and Alex Manugian who also played the role of Amir) had only written just story and established rules while most of the witty dialogue were improvised by actors themselves, thus proving that the film doesn't need some superstars, but rather talented ensemble cast. Although the hand-held camera-work might seem to take viewer out of the story, it was just another way to give more room to the improvisation. Despite all of that the film manages to keep an eerie atmosphere, and the story movies on one continuous flow without getting sidetracked. The story also doesn't crumble into pieces under it's own ambitions. The twists hold together and actually makes sense. Although the final twist might seem to be rushed and thrown into there just for the sake of it, but it kinda fits and doesn't change the film's overall tone.\n\n'Coherence' is slow burning psychological science-fiction for a thinking person, and it holds up much better than most big budgeted pretentious science-fiction extravaganzas. Recommended especially for those who like independent sci-fi and/or films that take place in one room.\n\n- hrkepler\n- Jun 11, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ2\n\n- What's up with Beth's Vial?\n- What is the Schrodinger's Cat?

It is a direct prequel to the 1982 film of the same name by John Carpenter, which was an adaptation of the 1938 novella Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell. It tells the story of a team of scientists on a Norwegian Antarctic research station who discover a parasitic alien buried deep in the ice, realizing too late that it is still alive.\n\nThe Thing premiered on October 10, 2011, and was released on October 14, 2011. The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only $31.5 million worldwide on a budget of $38 million, and received mixed reviews from critics, with many comparing it unfavorably to the 1982 film.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn the winter of 1982, members of the Norwegian research station \"Thule\" discover an alien spacecraft and a nearby alien body buried in the Antarctic ice. Dr. Sander Halvorson and his assistant Adam Finch recruit American paleontologist Kate Lloyd to investigate. Together with pilots Sam Carter, Derek Jameson, and crewman Griggs, they fly to Thule Station and meet station chief Edvard Wolner, along with his team of Juliette, Karl, Jonas, Olav, Henrik, Colin, Peder, Lars, and Lars' dog.\n\nThe body, encased in a block of ice, is transported to Thule Station. While the team celebrates their historic find, Jameson witnesses the Thing burst from the ice block. The team splits up to search for the alien and find Lars' dog dead. The alien drags Henrik into itself, spattering blood on Olav. The group kills the alien by igniting spilled fuel beneath it. An autopsy reveals that the alien's cells were copying Henrik's. Olav falls ill.\n\nAs Carter, Jameson, and Griggs are taking off in the helicopter to take Olav to a medical facility, Griggs transforms into a Thing and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to crash in the mountains. Kate discovers dental fillings in a bloodied shower and alerts the team that the alien can assimilate and imitate its victims to hide among them. Edvard orders the team to drive to the closest base; however, Juliette and Kate want to prevent anyone from leaving. After going with Kate to get the keys to the vehicles, Juliette transforms and attempts to kill her. Kate escapes and the Juliette-Thing kills Karl. Lars kills the Juliette-Thing with a flamethrower and the team resolves to quarantine themselves until the threat is eliminated.\n\nThat night, Carter and Jameson stagger back from the crash. Suspected of being infected, they are kept in isolation. As the alien does not assimilate and imitate inorganic material (as Kate realized from the discarded dental fillings), Kate proposes everyone to be checked for dental fillings. The test clears all but Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, as they have no metallic fillings.\n\nLars is abducted while going to fetch Carter and Jameson for testing. Carter and Jameson break into the main building, shooting Peder dead and puncturing his flamethrower tank, causing an explosion that knocks Edvard unconscious. When brought to the main room, Edvard violently transforms into the Thing, infects Jonas, kills Jameson, then assimilates Adam, becoming a two-headed thing. Kate burns Jonas and Jameson before they can fully transform, then she and Carter burn the Edvard/Adams-Thing before pursuing Sander, who had also been assimilated.\n\nThe Sander-Thing drives in a snowcat to the spaceship. The spacecraft suddenly activates, shifting and separating Kate and Carter, with Kate falling into ship and Carter proceeding through the main hatch. Kate encounters the monstrous Sander-Thing and kills it with a grenade, which shuts down the ship's engines. Kate finds Carter and notices that he is missing his earring; Carter reaches for the wrong ear, confirming to her that he is the Thing in disguise. Kate burns the Carter-Thing, preventing its escape. Kate enters a second snowcat and prepares to drive to the Soviet base 50 miles away.\n\nThe next morning, Thule's helicopter and pilot Matias returns to the ruined station. Matias finds the burned remains of the two-headed Adams-Thing. Colin's corpse sits in the radio comms room, his wrists slit and a straight razor held in his hand. Lars, having been hiding in the building where Jameson and Carter attacked him, demands at gunpoint that Matias show his teeth. Lars' dog, thought dead, emerges and runs away. Realizing that the dog is a Thing, Lars orders Matias to give chase in the helicopter.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate Lloyd, an American vertebrate paleontologist graduate from Columbia University:[6] In order to be different from Kurt Russell as the 1982 film's protagonist, R.J. MacReady, Kate Lloyd was written to have similar traits as the character Ellen Ripley from the Alien film series.[7]\n- Joel Edgerton as Sam Carter,[8][9] an American helicopter pilot and Vietnam War veteran running a supply operation to the bases. He and his two co-pilots are left in the dark as to why they are there and what is the mysterious thing the scientists have found.[7]\n- Ulrich Thomsen as Dr. Sander Halvorson, the arrogant Danish leader of alien research. He orders the team to obtain a sample of the recently discovered creature despite Kate's warnings.[10] Norwegian actor Dennis Storhøi was initially hired to play the role, but was replaced by Thomsen after a week of filming. This required some digital effects work in post, as Thomsen's face was put on Storhoi's body for scenes that had already been shot with the other actor.[11]\n- Eric Christian Olsen as Adam Finch, a young Canadian scientist working as Dr. Sander's research assistant who invites Kate to the Norwegian base.[12]\n- Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Derek Jameson,[13] an American helicopter co-pilot and also a Vietnam veteran who is Carter's best friend.[14]\n- Paul Braunstein as Griggs, a crew-chief member of the American helicopter transport team.\n- Trond Espen Seim[15] as Edvard Wolner, a notable Norwegian geologist who is the station commander and an old friend of Sander.\n- Kim Bubbs as Juliette, a French geologist who is part of Edvard's team.\n- Jørgen Langhelle as Lars, an ex-soldier who works as the dog keeper of the Norwegian base. He is the only member of the Norwegian base who does not speak English. Lars is also revealed to be the Norwegian shooter in the original film.[16]\n- Kristofer Hivju as Jonas, a nervous but friendly Norwegian polar ice researcher.[12]\n- Jan Gunnar Røise as Olav, a Norwegian Snowcat vehicle driver and guide.[12]\n- Stig Henrik Hoff[17] as Peder, a Norwegian rifle-toting camp member who is Edvard's right-hand man.\n- Jo Adrian Haavind as Henrik, another Norwegian base member who assists the alien research team.[18]\n- Carsten Bjørnlund as Karl, a Norwegian geologist also part of Edvard's team.\n- Jonathan Lloyd Walker as Colin, an eccentric English radio operator.[19]\n- Ole Martin Aune Nilsen as Matias, the helicopter pilot of the Norwegian base currently in a mission to restock kerosene at Halley. Matias, like Lars, is revealed to be aboard the Norwegian helicopter in the 1982 film.\n- Michael Brown as Hank, a security guard and a bit part who introduces Adam and Sander to Kate.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\n| \"It's a really fascinating way to construct a story because we're doing it by autopsy, by examining very, very closely everything we know about the Norwegian camp and about the events that happened there from photos and video footage that's recovered, from a visit to the base, the director, producer and I have gone through it countless times marking, you know, there's a fire axe in the door, we have to account for that... we're having to reverse engineer it, so those details all matter to us 'cause it all has to make sense.\"    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| — Eric Heisserer describing the process of creating a script that is consistent with the first film.[20]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nAfter creating the Dawn of the Dead remake, producers Marc Abraham and Eric Newman began to look through the Universal Studios library to find new properties to work on.[21] Upon finding John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing, the two convinced Universal to create a prequel instead of a remake, as they felt that remaking Carpenter's film would be like \"paint(ing) a moustache on the Mona Lisa\".[22] Eric Newman explained; \"I'd be the first to say no one should ever try to do Jaws again and I certainly wouldn't want to see anyone remake The Exorcist... And we really felt the same way about The Thing. It's a great film. But once we realized there was a new story to tell, with the same characters and the same world, but from a very different point of view, we took it as a challenge. It's the story about the guys who are just ghosts in Carpenter's movie – they're already dead. But having Universal give us a chance to tell their story was irresistible.\"[23]\n\nIn early 2009, Variety reported the launch of a project to film a prequel—possibly following MacReady's brother during the events leading up to the opening moments of the 1982 film—with Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. as director and Ronald D. Moore as writer.[24][25] Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. became involved in the project when his first planned feature film, a sequel to the Dawn of the Dead remake, a zombie film taking place in Las Vegas written and produced by Zack Snyder, who directed the Dawn of the Dead remake, and co-produced by Abraham and  Newman, called Army of the Dead, was cancelled by the studio three months before production began. Needing to start all over again, he asked his agent to see if there was a The Thing project in development, since Alien and The Thing are his favorite films.[26] As a fan of Carpenter's film, he was interested in the project because, being European himself, he had always wondered what happened at the Norwegian camp.[27] In March 2009, Moore described his script as a \"companion piece\" to Carpenter's film and \"not a remake.\"[28] \"We're telling the story of the Norwegian camp that found the Thing before the Kurt Russell group did\", he said.[28]\n\nEric Heisserer was later hired to do a complete rewrite of Moore's script.[29] While in Moore's original draft was clear who would be the Thing, in rewrites it was decided the audience should not know who is infected in order to add to the sense of paranoia.[30] Heisserer explained that in rewriting the script, it was necessary for him to research all the information that was revealed about the Norwegian camp from the first film, down to the smallest details, so that it could be incorporated into the prequel in order to create a consistent backstory.[20] Heisserer also expressed part of the difficulty in writing the script was creating characters that were smart scientists, who, without copying what was done by characters in the first film, would come up with a test to determine who the thing is, yet still ultimately be outsmarted by the creature.[31] The decision was made to name the film the same title as the first film, because the producers felt adding a \"colon title\" such as Exorcist II: The Heretic had felt less reverential.[27] In April 2010, it was revealed that Scott Frank had been hired to work uncredited on new dialogue for the film.[32]\n\nMatthijs van Heijningen Jr. explained that he created the film not to simply be a horror film, but to also focus largely on the human drama with the interaction between characters, as the first film had.[33] The director felt that horror films worked better when time was spent to explore the characters' emotional journeys, allowing the audience to care about them.[34] Mary Elizabeth Winstead insisted that the film would not feature any romantic or sexual elements with her character, as it would be inappropriate considering the tone of the film.[35] Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje said that the film would try to recreate the feeling of paranoia and distrust that the first film had, where the characters can't tell who has been infected by the alien.[36] The filmmakers drew additional inspiration for the film from the original novel Who Goes There?, in making the characters in the film educated scientists as opposed to \"blue collar\" workers.[27] However, the filmmakers drew no influence from the events of The Thing video game.[27] The director also drew additional inspiration from the film Alien in creating the film, particularly in regard to casting a female lead,[33] and in the way the alien creatures are filmed by not showing too much of them.[26]\n\nMatthijs van Heijningen also cited the films of director Roman Polanski as influence, such as his work on Rosemary's Baby.[34] Actual Norwegian and Danish actors were cast in the film to play the Norwegian characters,[27] and the director allowed the actors to improvise elements different from what was scripted when they felt it was appropriate, such as a scene where the characters sing a Norwegian folk song called \"Sámiid ædnan\".[34][35][37][38] Many scenes involving characters speaking Norwegian were subtitled,[39] and the language barrier between them and the English speaking characters is exploited to add to the film's feeling of paranoia.[40] Director Matthijs van Heijningen said that the film would show the alien creature in its \"pure form\", as it was discovered in its ship by the Norwegians; however, it is not revealed whether this is the creature's original form or the form of another creature it had assimilated.[7] Addressing rumors stating that John Carpenter wished to have a cameo appearance in the film,[27] Carpenter himself corrected these in an interview for the fan site \"Outpost 31\", in August 2012. \"[Those] rumors are not true\", Carpenter stated in the interview.[41]\n\n### Filming and visual effects\n\nThe film was shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film, as the director dislikes the look of films shot digitally.[34] The director chose not to fast cut the film, instead opting for a slower pace, hoping to build a sense of dread.[34] The prequel was filmed in Pinewood Toronto Studios, Port Lands on March 22, 2010, and ended on June 28, 2010.[42] On set, the director had a laptop computer which contained \"a million\" screen captures of the Carpenter film, which he used as a point of reference to keep the Norwegian camp visually consistent with the first film.[43]  Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. of Amalgamated Dynamics (ADI) created the practical creature effects for the film.[44] In addition to creating the visual effects for the human-Thing transformations, Gillis, Woodruff and their team had the challenge of coming up with the look of the alien in the ice block unearthed by the Norwegians. While it was initially only intended to be shown as a silhouette, the director liked their designs and encouraged them to fully create the creature, which was realized by creating a creature suit that Tom Woodruff wore.[40] The effects team opted to use cable-operated animatronics over more complex hydraulic controls, as they felt they gave a more \"organic feel\".[40] To emulate the creature effects of the first film, Heisserer revealed that traditional practical effects would be used on the creatures whenever possible.[45] The puppetry team also included several Canadian puppeteers, including Frank Meschkuleit, Gord Robertson, Rob Mills, Fred Stinson, Mike Petersen, Trish Leeper, Ron Stefaniuk, Karen Valleau, Ronnie Burkett, Matt Ficner, Jason Hopley, and Marty Stelnick; many of whom had worked on TV shows like Fraggle Rock and The Big Comfy Couch. The film's computer-generated imagery (CGI) was created by Image Engine, the visual effects house who worked on Neill Blomkamp's 2009 film District 9.[33]\n\nComputer graphics were used to digitally create extensions on some of the practical animatronic effects, as well as for digital matte paintings and set extensions.[33] Alec Gillis stated that the advancement of animatronic technology since 1982 combined with digital effects allowed the effects team to expand upon the possible creature conceptions.[43] Matthijs van Heijningen preferred to use practical effects over computer imagery, as he believed actors give better performances when they have something physical to react to.[27]  Speaking about the practical effects, he stated that acting with physical props \"is much better than working with tennis balls [as markers]\".[46] Stunt men covered in fire-retardant gel were used in scenes when characters are set on fire.[40] The original Ennio Morricone score was reflected in the film's score, but it was initially reported that Morricone did not score the film, nor was his music from the 1982 version used.[39]\n\nThe interior of the crashed alien spacecraft was created by production designer Sean Haworth.[40] To design the ship, Haworth had to recreate what little was shown of the spacecraft in the Carpenter film, then \"fill the gaps\" for what was not originally shown. Haworth and a team of approximately twelve others then created the inside of the ship as a several story-high interior set constructed mostly out of a combination of foam, plaster, fiberglass, and plywood.[40] The ship was designed specifically to look as if it were not made to accommodate humans, but rather alien creatures of different size and shape who could walk on any surface.[40] A section of the craft called the \"pod room\" was designed to imply the alien creatures manning it had collected specimens of different alien species from around the universe for a zoological expedition.[40][47]\n\n### Studio mandated reshoots\n\nWhile the film was originally set for release in April, Universal Pictures changed the date to October 14, 2011,[48] to allow time for reshoots. An official studio press release stated that the intention of the reshoots was to \"enhance existing sequences or to make crystal clear a few story beats or to add punctuation marks to the film's feeling of dread.\"[49]  Universal had test screenings of an early version of the film shown to focus groups, the reaction to which the studio interpreted as negative. In response, many scenes involving character development were either cut from the film, or reshot to be shortened, as the studio disliked the \"slow boil\" pace of the film.[50] Another concern was that the use of practical effects made the film look too much, \"like an 80's movie\". In response, the decision was made to replace most of the film's practical effects with CGI.[51][52] In post-release interviews, Alec Gillis revealed that while Amalgamated Dynamics creature designs for the film remained mostly intact, most of their practical effects ended up being digitally replaced in post-production. The creation of Gillis's all-practical-effects independent horror film Harbinger Down was partially in response to this.[53][54] Writer Eric Heisserer stated the decision, \"Broke my heart\".[31] Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has since expressed regret over replacing the film's practical effects with CGI, saying, \"I know this is a debated topic, but looking back, we were caught in a cross-zone where animatronics were old-fashioned and the CGI wasn't good enough. We made the wrong decision to do it in post-production [when it came to] making the monster design in the computer. I regret that now.\"[55]\n\nOn his Facebook page, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. claimed that the reshoots of the film included making an entirely different ending, referring to the original cut as the \"Pilot Version\" and the new cut as the \"Tetris Version\". In the original ending, Kate was to discover the original pilots of the spaceship which had all been killed by The Thing, which was an escaped specimen they had collected from another planet, implying that the ship was crashed in an attempt to kill the monster. \"I liked that idea because it would be the Norwegian camp in space. Kate sees the pod room and one pod being broken, giving her the clues what happened. What didn't work was that she wanted to find Sander and stop the ship from taking off and still solve the mystery in the ship. These two energies were in conflict.\"[56] The original ending had Kate finding the corpse of the alien pilot of the spaceship, discovering that it had accidentally come into contact with the Thing while collecting biological specimens on a zoological expedition, and deliberately killed itself by cutting its own air supply, and crashed its own ship in an attempt to kill the Thing.[57][58] For the new ending, ADI's practical animatronic alien pilot was replaced by a CGI display of rapidly shifting cubes,[59] and the addition of a CGI \"Sander-Thing\" was created at \"the last minute,\" the director said, \"and it shows, unfortunately.\"[56]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was premiered in New York City on October 10, 2011, and was released on October 14, 2011, in the United States.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Thing grossed $8,493,665 over the opening weekend and ended up third on the box office chart. It was distributed to 2,996 theaters and spent a total of one week on the top 10 chart, before dropping down to the 16th position in its second week. It concluded its domestic run with a total of $16,928,670.[5] Its box office collections were called \"an outright disappointment\" by Box Office Mojo, who goes on to say \"[the film] was naturally at a disadvantage: a vague \"thing\" doesn't give prospective audiences much to latch on to. It was therefore left up to fans of the original, who are already familiar with the concept, to turn out in strong numbers.\"[60] The film grossed $14,576,617 in foreign countries,[61] bringing the total worldwide box-office gross to $31,505,287.[5]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 34% based on 174 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It serves the bare serviceable minimum for a horror flick, but The Thing is all boo-scares and a slave to the far superior John Carpenter version.\"[62] According to Metacritic, which assigned it a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on 31 critics, the film received \"mixed or average reviews\".[63] In CinemaScore polls users gave the film a \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.[64]\n\nMichael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a rating of 3 out of 4, saying \"While I wish van Heijningen's Thing weren't quite so in lust with the '82 model, it works because it respects that basic premise; and it exhibits a little patience, doling out its ickiest, nastiest moments in ways that make them stick\".[65] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com called it a \"Loving prequel to a horror classic\", saying \"It's full of chills and thrills and isolated Antarctic atmosphere and terrific Hieronymus Bosch creature effects, and if it winks genially at the plot twists of Carpenter's film, it never feels even a little like some kind of inside joke.\"[66] James Berardinelli gave it three stars out of four, saying that it \"offers a similar overall experience\" to the 1982 film, but \"without replicating styles and situations\".[67] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic wrote that the narrative choices open to a prequel \"exist on a spectrum from the unsurprising to the unfaithful\", but van Heijningen \"has managed this balancing act about as well as could be hoped\" and although the line between homage and apery is a fine one, \"in our age of steady knockoffs, retreads, and loosely branded money grabs, The Thing stands out as a competent entertainment, capably executed if not particularly inspired.\"[68] Josh Bell of Las Vegas Weekly rated the film three out of five stars and wrote, \"Winstead makes for an appealing protagonist, and Kate is portrayed as competent without being thrust into some unlikely action-hero role.\"[69]\n\nKathleen Murphy of MSN Movies rated it two-and-a-half out of five stars, calling it \"a subpar slasher movie tricked out with tired 'Ten Little Indians' tropes and rip-offs from both Carpenter and the Christian Nyby-Howard Hawks' 1951 version of the chilling tale that started it all, John W. Campbell Jr.'s Who Goes There?\".[70] Jim Vejvoda of IGN Movies also rated the film two-and-a-half out of five, saying, \"This incarnation of The Thing is much like the creature it depicts: An insidious, defective mimic of the real, er, thing. It's not an entirely lost cause, but it is a needless one.\"[71] Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, the same rating he gave the 1982 film.[72] In Patrick Sauriol of Coming Attractions' review, he states, \"Stack it up against John Carpenter's version and it looks less shiny, but let's face it, if you're that kind of Thing fan you're going to go see the new movie anyway. Try and judge today's Thing on its own merits.\"[73] A brief review in Fangoria refers to the film as \"Matthijs van Heijningen's prequel that proves modern CGI is no match for old-school makeup FX\".[74]\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for two awards at the 38th Saturn Awards, but lost to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and X-Men: First Class.[75][76]\n\n|   Year | Award                              | Category                                                               | Recipient                                              | Result    | Ref.    |\n|--------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|  2012  | Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards | Best Film of 2011                                                      | The Thing                                              | Nominated | [77]    |\n|  2012  | Saturn Awards                      | Best Horror or Thriller Film                                           | The Thing                                              | Nominated | [75]    |\n|  2012  | Saturn Awards                      | Best Make-Up                                                           | Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis                       | Nominated | [75]    |\n|  2012  | Visual Effects Society Awards      | Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Feature Motion Picture | Lyndon Barrois, Fred Chapman, Greg Massie, Marco Menco | Nominated | [78]    |\n\n## Home media\n\nThe Thing was released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 31, 2012, in the US.[79] As of 2013, the film earned an additional $10,436,405 through Blu-ray and DVD sales.[80]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\n| The Thing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack   | The Thing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Soundtrack album by Marco Beltrami              | Soundtrack album by Marco Beltrami              |\n| Released                                        | October 11, 2011                                |\n| Genre                                           | Film score                                      |\n| Length                                          | 55:31                                           |\n| Label                                           | Varèse Sarabande                                |\n\nThe music for the film, which was composed and conducted by Marco Beltrami, was released on October 11, 2011.

Taking place in Greenland, it follows a group of stranded Norsemen who must deal with the shape-shifting creature within a desolate village. The three-issue tale was written by Steve Niles, drawn by Patric Reynolds and colored by Dave Stewart.[83]\n\nPlans were in development for a sequel, taking place with Kate's character battling the creature on an oil platform near the South Pole, however these plans were abandoned following the critical and financial failure of the film.[84]\n\n## Halloween Horror Nights event\n\nThe film was made into a maze at both Universal Studios Hollywood's and Universal Orlando's 2011 Halloween Horror Nights events, having the subtitle Assimilation at Hollywood's version.[85]\n\n## Director's cut online campaign\n\nIn 2015, Aidan Cosky started a Change.org petition to release the \"pilot version\", which was promoted by Dread Central even though the petition closed due to a lack of followers.[86] In 2020, the following social media hashtags: #ReleaseThePilotVersion[87][88] and #ReleaseTheStudioADIcut[89][90] were started in response to Zack Snyder's Justice League and the released BTS footage from Studio ADI on YouTube,[91] while Bloody Disgusting and NerdBot published articles and YouTube videos calling it one of the most anticipated director's cut in horror films.[92][93][94][95]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"The Thing (2011)\".

Committing suicide?Lena: You must have profiled him. You must have assessed him. He must have said something.Dr Ventress: So you're asking me as a psychologist?Lena: Yeah.Dr Ventress: Then, as a psychologist, I think you're confusing suicide with self-destruction. Almost none of us commit suicide, and almost all of us self-destruct. In some way, in some part of our lives. We drink, or we smoke, we destabilize the good job... and a happy marriage. But these aren't decisions, they're... they're impulses. In fact, you're probably better equipped to explain this than I am.Lena: What does that mean?Dr Ventress: You're a biologist. Isn't the self-destruction coded into us? Programmed into each cell?\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews: Annihilation (2018)\n\n- SoundtracksHelplessly Hoping\nPerformed by Crosby Stills &amp;amp; Nash (as Crosby Stills and Nash)\nWritten by Stephen Stills\nLicensed courtesy of Warner Music UK\nPublished by Gold Hill Music Inc (BMI)\n\n### User reviews2.2K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Atmospheric\n\nAfter watching this film I read the reviews voted \"most helpful,\" which all were long lists of plot holes and logical inconsistencies. They are absolutely right. I didn't think about it while watching the film, but when it's pointed out, yeah, nothing in this movie makes much sense.\n\nBut I still really liked it. It's creepy and atmospheric and more concerned with the psychology of people on a suicide mission than on the nuts and bolts of scientific investigation. It's often intense , usually beautiful, well acted, and had some really weird and mesmerizing moments.\n\nI won't argue that you should forgive it for its plot holes, or that it has any deep meaning, or anything like that. In fact, it's probably easier to make a convincing argument against the movie than for it. I'm just saying, I really liked it.\n\nADDENDUM: I looked at the user reviews recently (2024) and the top reviews are no longer lists of plot holes. The people who enjoyed the movie, like me, have since my review pushed the naysayers down. Which I fully support.\n\n- cherold\n- Jun 7, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ22\n\n- How long is Annihilation?Powered by Alexa\n- Is \"Annihilation\" based on a book?\n- What is the difference between the book and the movie?\n- Why does the Shimmer distort and transform the DNA of every creature?

Miller.[5]\n\nUnderwater follows a group of workers at a drilling facility at the bottom of the ocean who encounter hostile creatures after an earthquake destroys the facility. The film was released in the United States on January 10, 2020, by 20th Century Fox; it was the last film under the Fox name before the studio's rebranding as 20th Century Studios on January 17.[6] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office bomb, grossing $40 million worldwide against a production budget of $50–65 million.[1][7][8]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2050, the Kepler 822, a research and drilling facility operated by Tian Industries at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, is struck by what is assumed to be a strong earthquake. As part of the facility is destroyed by the incident, mechanical engineer Norah Price and her colleagues, Rodrigo and Paul, make their way to the escape pod bay. However, the three discover that all of the escape pods have already been deployed, with Captain Lucien being the only person in the area when the three arrive.\n\nTogether, they reach a control base and find biologist Emily Haversham and engineer Liam Smith, who are unsuccessful in their attempts to make contact with the surface. Lucien suggests using pressurized suits to walk one mile across the ocean floor to Roebuck 641 hoping to resurface from there. As they descend in a freight elevator, Rodrigo's defective helmet implodes under the water pressure, killing him. The surviving crew sees a distress beacon from one of the escape pods below, and Liam and Paul go to investigate.\n\nAs they arrive at the location, they find a body in the rubble. A creature emerges from the corpse's back and attacks them. Liam kills the creature and takes it inside. Emily examines the creature and realizes that it belongs to a previously undiscovered species.\n\nThe five make their way to the sea floor, but as they are walking, the Kepler explodes above and nearly buries them in debris. Liam is hit, but Norah and Lucien save him. They manage to get through an access tunnel to an intermediate station, where they can charge and clean their suits. However, they find that Liam's oxygen scrubber is badly damaged from the debris.\n\nOn their way through the access tunnel, Paul is attacked by an unknown creature, dragged underwater, and killed. Before the team leaves the access tunnel, they find that Liam's damaged oxygen pod will cause him to suffocate from the explosion's toxic fumes. Unwilling to leave another crew member behind, Norah, Lucien, and Emily agree to help Liam walk.\n\nThe four set off across the ocean floor, but a humanoid creature appears and drags Smith into a cave. Lucien manages to get Liam out, but he is pulled from the other three. Norah is dragged along with Lucien, but Lucien sacrifices himself to spare Norah from the increasing pressure differential.\n\nNorah ends up at the abandoned Shepard station alone and is able to change her damaged diving suit before continuing toward Roebuck. Walking along the ocean floor, she reunites with Emily and Liam and proceeds to help drag the latter.\n\nAs they enter Roebuck, they encounter a nest of humanoid creatures hanging from the ceiling and try to sneak by, but the sound of Emily's oxygen alarm wakes the creatures. Norah is partially swallowed by one of the creatures but is able to kill it and free herself.\n\nThe three manage to reach the escape pod bay, but Norah discovers that only two of the pods are functional. Norah and Emily manage to get the ailing Liam into a pod, and Norah persuades Emily to take the last one.\n\nAs this happens, a gigantic creature emerges and attacks the Roebuck, while the smaller creatures follow the two escape pods. Norah, accepting her impending death, initiates an overload of Roebuck's nuclear core, resulting in a massive explosion that kills the creatures and allows the escape pods to reach the surface. During the credits, news headlines say there were only two survivors, and Tian Industries refuses to be involved with investigations into the events due to expanding its drilling efforts.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Kristen Stewart as Norah Price – the mechanical engineer of the Kepler 822\n- Vincent Cassel as Captain Lucien – the captain of the Kepler 822\n- Jessica Henwick as Emily Haversham – the biologist of the Kepler 822\n- John Gallagher Jr. as Liam Smith – the engineer of the Kepler 822\n- Mamoudou Athie as Rodrigo Nagenda – one of Norah's crewmates on the Kepler 822 and the first survivor Norah finds\n- T.J. Miller as Paul Abel – one of Norah's crewmates who survived the initial cave in\n\n## Production\n\n### Development and casting\n\nOn February 22, 2017, it was announced that Kristen Stewart would star in Underwater, a film to be directed by William Eubank from a screenplay by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad. It was revealed that principal production would commence the next month.[9] On March 7, 2017, T.J. Miller and Jessica Henwick joined the cast, and principal production was set to commence later that month in New Orleans.[10]\n\nOn April 5, 2017, during principal production, Vincent Cassel and Mamoudou Athie joined the cast,[11] and the next day, John Gallagher Jr. was also added.[12] In May 2017, following the end of filming for the film, it was revealed that Gunner Wright was also part of the cast.[13] After shooting the film, the director decided to design the alpha creature based on H. P. Lovecraft's mythos,[14] as it features Cthulhu as the monster.[15]\n\n### Music\n\nMarco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts composed the film score. Fox Music and Hollywood Records released the soundtrack.\n\n### Alternate ending\n\nIn an alternate ending, after overloading the core, Norah makes her way to the damaged escape pod and rewires it, escaping just before the Roebuck explodes.[16] This ending was not featured in the theatrical release of the film.\n\n## Release\n\nUnderwater was released in the United States on January 10, 2020[17] and in UK cinemas on February 7, 2020.[18]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nUnderwater grossed $17.3 million in the United States and Canada and $23.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $41 million.[1]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Underwater was released alongside Like a Boss and the expansions of Just Mercy and 1917, and was projected to gross around $8 million in its opening weekend.[19][7] The film made $2.7 million on its first day, including $500,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut at $7 million, finishing seventh at the box office.[2] The film fell 48% in its second weekend to $3.6 million (and $4.8 million over the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday), finishing eleventh.[20]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Underwater's strong cast and stylish direction aren't enough to distract from the strong sense of déjà vu provoked by this claustrophobic thriller's derivative story.\"[21] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[22] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 2 out of 5 stars, with 35% of people saying they would definitely recommend it.[2]\n\nJohn DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"This is a creature feature, whose gory jump-scares and icktastic critter design are the reason you're here. An ensemble led by Kristen Stewart brings credible camaraderie to the scenario without quite matching the vivid chemistry of Alien and its best descendants; with such a tightly packed survival tale ahead of them, though, few viewers will be calling out for more character development.\"[23]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"Underwater is a stupefying entertainment in which every claustrophobic space and apocalyptic crash of water registers as a slick visual trigger, yet it's all built on top of a dramatic void. It's boredom in Sensurround.\"[24]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                         | Date of ceremony    | Category                                       | Recipient(s)                                                         | Result    | Ref.    |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Visual Effects Society Awards | April 6, 2021       | Outstanding Compositing in a Photoreal Feature | Sreejith Venugopalan, Ruslan Borysov, Susil Sabat, Andreas Andersson | Nominated | [25]    |\n\n## See also\n\n- Gorgo (film), a 1961 film, featuring a fictional giant mother monster, Gorgo\n- List of underwater science fiction works\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d \"Underwater (2020)\".

Unlike with 300, which was short and sharp and shallow and easy to adapt, the original Watchmen is incredibly dense and, as written, unfilmable. So Snyder did something very smart - he didn't even try. What he did instead was to take the world of Watchmen and rebuild it in a way which made a virtue of this new medium (film) rather than try to cram the graphic novel into a cinematic form.\n\nNowhere is this approach more obvious than in the film's title sequence. A wonderfully composed collage of images depicts scenes from the universe of Watchmen in a way which is only possible in the movies. In this way, we are subconsciously introduced to a world where costumed heroes are a part of everyday culture and brought, in a stylish and fluid way, from the original days of the Minutemen to those of the Watchmen. This introduction is cinematically perfect and is indicative of the heights which the Watchmen movie is perfectly capable of achieving but not quite capable of sustaining.\n\nWatchen is a brave film for a major studio to make and without a doubt it would not exist in its present form without the success of 300. It is incredibly dark (both in tone as well as shooting style) with events that would be anathema to any other superhero story. The less you know about the story, the better so there will be no spoilers here but suffice to say Watchmen's version of a happy ending is a far cry from the Hollywood norm.\n\nSnyders brings his unique approach to action to bear on Watchmen, expanding on the action scenes in the comic without making it feel too redundant. His efforts are ably supported by the incredibly game cast, excellent cinematography and near perfect visual effects - this film is incredible to look at but also manages to create an entire world in a way which most superhero stories never do. The attention to detail in even the smallest scenes is commendable and the dense flashback structure means the same attention is paid to the presentation of full and complex characters.\n\nSnyder has made a film which is gorgeous to look at, agreeably violent, well written, wonderfully designed and features some of the best small scale action sequences ever committed to celluloid. But, naturally, not everything is perfect. Most of the performances are excellent, with a cast of relative unknowns who manage to distinguish themselves despite constantly competing with overbearing effects and design. Patrick Wilson, in particular, does great work with a difficult role as Nite Owl, while Jackie Earle Hayley is blistering as Rorschach. Unfortunately in a film which could have done with a strong female presence, neither Carla Gugino nor Malin Ackerman make much of an impression, despite having quite a lot of screen time. Synder's musical cues are another bone of contention - often pushing the tone of the film into the realm of parody. And the ending... well let's just say it cheapens the experience in search of the lowest common denominator and the whole package suffers. On a related note, neither of the stories major revelations are handled that well. These moments were genuinely shocking in the graphic novel but are almost glossed over in the film.\n\nDon't get the wrong impression, Watchmen is a good film, sometimes a great film. Snyder has managed to make a movie which is a terrifically well balanced compromise between accessibility and fidelity. That anyone can sit down in the cinema and experience a distillation of the Watchmen universe in just 163 minutes is a marvel. It does not deliver the depth of feeling and connection of the novel but that is more a matter of the differences in the media than a failure on the part of the film.\n\nOn its own merits, Zack Synder's Watchmen is a dark and twisted tale peopled with complex characters whose motivations are not obvious even to themselves. It is a solid film, sometimes rising into the extraordinary, and deserves to be successful. This is not Alan Moore's Watchmen but it is a competent extension of the universe into another medium and a worthy cinema-going experience.\n\n- ftyl\n- Feb 25, 2009\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ39\n\n- How long is Watchmen?Powered by Alexa\n- Is \"Watchmen\" based on a book?\n- Does the film retain its 1985 setting?\n- Why are there two Nite Owls and two Silk Spectres?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - March 5, 2009 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Legendary Entertainment\n    - Official Facebook\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Watchmen.

Along with producers Thomas and Aaron Ryder, production designer Nathan Crowley, and “anyone else who wanted to join, we had these movie parties and said, ‘Let’s watch this, it might apply,’” Pfister recalls. “They weren’t movies we were trying to copy or emulate, per se; the ones we chose were just successful visual movies. Barry Lyndon [AC March ’76] was probably the closest, visually, to our concept. It was an interesting education.”\n\nThe friendly rivalry between Angier and English magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, left) becomes a bitter feud.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe filmmakers strove to find practical locations in and around Los Angeles that could be redressed as turn-of-the-century London. Pfister explains, “Chris and I had both just had kids — our third each — and we all really preferred to stay close to home for this film. Even though the story takes place in London, [production designer] Nathan [Crowley] was confident we could utilize L.A. for London and stay in town without having to build too much on stages.” The trio scouted the streets and alleyways of downtown Los Angeles, paying particular attention to the area’s historic proscenium theaters.\n\n“A lot of the architecture in downtown L.A. is actually very similar to what you might find in 1906 London: big brick buildings, alleyways, and so forth,” says Pfister. “Chris didn’t want the movie’s period to get in the way of the storytelling, so we decided to break with convention by using a handheld camera throughout the film, which is not often done in movies depicting the turn of the century! That was a lot of fun, because it was a different approach to this type of material.”\n\nKnowing that the project would involve significant handheld work, Pfister chose the Panaflex Millennium XL2 as his main camera. “I made the decision to operate myself, primarily because of the shooting style we had in mind. Not only were we trying to keep the lighting simple, but Chris also wanted to give the actors total freedom of movement. That meant the camera was on my shoulder the whole picture, which allowed us to handle the entire execution in a very organic way: the actors were free to move around however they wanted, and I followed. We were often showing 180 to 360 degrees in each location. In certain scenes, Chris empowered me to make decisions about where the camera would be at any given moment. It was a very documentary-like style, and I was helped considerably by the years I’d spent shooting docs and working in cutting rooms. Chris never told me who to follow or where to point the camera. Instead, he told me, ‘Go with your gut. If we’re missing pieces, we’ll pick them up in the end.’ That’s exactly how we did it, and I think that gives the film a very free spirit.\n\nRupert Angier (Jackman) makes a dramatic entrance. Magical apparatuses and\n\r\nmechanical effects play a large role in the film, which is set in London during the early 1900s.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Film frame)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n“That kind of shooting can work with an operator, but there can also be a detachment when you bring in a third party,” he continues. “Chris trusts me enough to let me tell the story with the camera. He also prefers simplicity, and having a third person in this kind of relationship requires more communication and time. Chris isn’t a director who sits back in video village; he’s right beside the camera, which creates a certain intimacy between us and the actors 12 feet away.”\n\nPfister is quick to point out that this working style is not for every production. “I couldn’t have done The Italian Job without an operator as good as Scott Sakamoto. I don’t feel like I always have to operate, and I value the input from a great operator. But in this case, it worked much better that I was the one with the camera on my shoulder. However, we did carry a standby operator, Craig Fikse, who did most of the Steadicam work.”\n\n## “I know there are a lot of directors who love shooting with two cameras to maximize the coverage quickly. If you do that, though, you always have to compromise something, and it’s not always the lighting.”\n\nScarlett Johansson plays Olivia Wenscombe, who works with both magicians throughout the film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cinematographer admits that from a physical standpoint, handholding the camera for nearly the entire show was an exhausting challenge.“In the beginning, I really started to fall apart physically; it was like training for a marathon. After about five grueling weeks, I was finally able to keep up with the pace after sufficiently developing the muscles in my shoulders, upper and lower back. When I really got in trouble, we tried using an Aaton camera, but the anamorphic lenses made it too front-heavy, which created a whole new set of problems. In the end, the Millennium XL2 was the best option; I just had to train on the job to keep up with the demanding handheld work Chris was throwing at me.”\n\nNearly 300 practical bulbs were used create a surreal glow for the “Field of Lights” set, located atop Mount Wilson just outside of Los Angeles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA prime example of Pfister’s low-tech approach is a sequence shot at a Victorian-era museum in Pasadena that doubled for Borden’s home. Because the museum already offered perfect set dressing and ambiance, very little additional work was required to prep the location. Pfister kept things even simpler by lighting with the museum’s existing fixtures. “The scene involved an argument between Borden and his wife [played by Rebecca Hall],” he explains. “We were using the museum as their living room, and during the location scout, I had noticed this beautiful chandelier. While we were walking through, I stuck my meter out and found that the chandelier was giving me a reading of T2.8. That was even more light than I needed, so I could afford to diffuse it. On the actual shooting day, we came in and shot the wide stuff with the natural chandelier. When we went in tighter, I simply wrapped the fixture in a layer of 251 diffusion, and it created a beautiful half-key light on the actors’ faces. I wound up shooting that scene at T2.3, and it looked fantastic.\n\nOne of the few indoor sets for the film was an understage area built at Downey Studios. The set included trap doors and a practical elevator. In this scene, Angier steals a moment alone with magician’s assistant Olivia Wendscome (Scarlett Johannson).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n“That scene was shot with almost no movie lights at all,” he continues. “There were these great sconce fixtures on the walls in the background that added some wonderful texture, but that was it. I could have put up a movie light to mimic the chandelier and get a little more stop, but then I would have had to augment the sconces and add more light to the background. When you start doing that, it suddenly becomes an arms race. Why do it if you don’t have to?\n\n“Of course, in a situation like that, the light doesn’t look great from all angles. Only certain angles are going to look good, so you have to assert more control over where you’re shooting. For that scene, we gave the actors marks, and I only shot from one side. The key is knowing what looks good. That kind of lighting — or not lighting — can easily look like crap without the proper approach. It may sound a bit immodest to say that, but it’s the truth. Quite honestly, I rely on every ounce of my experience to take this kind of approach to a big feature and still have it look right. I used these kinds of low-tech techniques when I was starting out with Roger Corman, but it’s the years of experience since then that have given me the confidence to return to those techniques and carry them off with more quality and style. I feel I’ve reached a point in my career where I can take a major risk and still have the confidence to do a good job. That said, I don’t want to give the impression that we didn’t use any lighting on this film, or that you don’t need to light in general. The scene at the museum was a special circumstance where we could be much more clever and organic with our lighting, so we took a very minimalistic approach.”\n\nA painting by English artist John Atkinson Grimshaw inspired Pfister to use a green/yellow color palette in his lighting for the London street sets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWarming to this subject, Pfister says that his approach to cinematography is greatly influenced by the work of Gordon Willis, ASC. “Willis was never afraid not to use a light. He was never afraid to use practical lights or whatever it took to bring the story to life. Honestly, he’s my absolute hero. Every time I do something, his work is in the back of my mind. Watching his films taught me that cinematographers can serve as partners in the storytelling, but that we should never grandstand or force anything that will work against the story we’re trying to tell.\n\nProviding another example of his stripped-down approach to The Prestige, Pfister cites a scene set in the workshop of Cutter (Michael Caine), who serves as Angier’s ingenieur, the craftsman who creates the technology behind the magic. Cutter’s shop is a large, loft-like space with a big picture window. Pfister decided to work the short scene — a dialogue between the two characters — entirely in natural daylight with no additional augmentation.\n\n## “Our working style on this film was an incredibly liberating experience for me. I really enjoyed not being fussy with the lighting, letting things go raw at times, and sometimes not lighting at all.”\n\nA Los Angeles warehouse provided the setting for the London workshop where Angier meets with Cutter (Sir Michael Caine, right), the ingenieur who crafts the technology behind the magic tricks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor scenes where lighting was required, Pfister allowed the film’s era to dictate his choices. In London in 1905, electrical power was just beginning to replace gas- and firelight, so the cinematographer could pick and choose from these three sources, depending on the environments of various scenes. While shooting on the upscale theatrical stages where the magicians perform, he turned to electric light fixtures. Source Four ERS fixtures with 2K backs simulated “limelight” theatrical spotlights, while tungsten balloons provided a soft, overall ambiance. Scenes involving gaslight fixtures were illuminated with a combination of actual firelight and electrical fixtures, simple gas lamps with glass chimneys. To simulate the effect of handheld lanterns, Pfister and gaffer Cory Geryak rigged up some “super lanterns” for the actors to work with, incorporating 750- watt tungsten globes that were powered through AC cables hidden in the actors’ clothes.\n\nWhile Pfister’s general philosophy on the show was to keep lighting setups small, larger rigs were occasionally employed for street scenes. In this example, Maxi-Brutes are bounced into 20'x20' frames of Ultra Bounce to create a soft, overhead light source.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother fixture that was created specifically for the film was the “EB” or “Easy-Bake” light, named for the intense heat it generated. Geryak strung 1K globes together in groups of three or five, mounting them in softbox housings created with pieces of material from firemen’s turnout coats that had been riveted together. The faces of these fixtures were covered with the diffusion of choice, and the small units could be placed in corners or easily hidden. “The EB fixtures created a great throw that would reach all the way across a room and give me a decent stop,” says Pfister.“I was usually using Light Grid on them. They ranged in size from 1-by-2 feet to 5 feet long in a big, soft snoot. I must share credit with my exceptional key grip, Ray Garcia, who always had his eyes and ears sharply focused on the set, and whose contribution to the film is evident.”\n\nAn eerie fog engulfs the setting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAddressing the film’s post phase, Pfister notes that “the prints were skillfully timed, in a completely photochemical process, by David Orr at Technicolor in North Hollywood, and the results reflect exactly what we had been hoping to achieve way back in our earliest conversations about how to tell this story.”\n\nReflecting upon his overall experience with The Prestige, Pfister enthuses, “Our working style on this film was an incredibly liberating experience for me. I really enjoyed not being fussy with the lighting, letting things go raw at times, and sometimes not lighting at all. I could really feel the shackles being unlocked. It was an exciting approach and a great way to work. I’m very grateful that Chris took me to that place, and I’m extremely proud of the results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTECHNICAL SPECS\n\nAnamorphic 2.40:1\nPanaflex Millennium XL2\nC- and E-Series lenses\nKodak Vision2 500T 5218,250D 5205\n\nIf you enjoy archival and retrospective articles on classic and influential films, you'll find more AC historical coverage here.\n\n###### Tagged:\n\n#### Read More\n\n- Cinerama Goes Dramatic for How the West Was Won\n- How the West Was Won — in Cinerama\n- American Psycho: 25th Anniversary\n- Chase, Crush and Devour in The Lost World: Jurassic Park\n\n#### Subscribe Today\n\nAct now to receive 12 issues of the award-winning AC magazine — the world’s finest cinematography resource.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The American Society of Cinematographers\n\n### Loyalty, Progress, Artistry\n\n#### CONNECT\n\n- About\n- Media\n- Terms of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Contact\n- FAQ\n\n©  American Society of Cinematographers.

The brood parasite manipulates a host, of the same or another species, to raise its young as if it were its own, using brood mimicry, for example by having eggs (or pudgy, weird babies) that resemble the host's. This behavior relieves the parents from the investment of rearing young. Some bird species mitigate the risk of egg loss by distributing eggs among a number of hosts.\n\n- GoofsWhen the main characters are dancing in front of the car you can see a crew member hiding behind the car door.\n\n- QuotesGemma: Did you see the boy?Tom: No.Gemma: He's gone missing.Tom: Well, so have we.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Half in the Bag: Quarantine Catch-up (part 2 of 2) (2020)\n\n- SoundtracksRudy A Message To You\nWritten by Dandy Livingstone (as Robert Thompson)\nPerformed by Dandy Livingstone\nUsed by permission of Carlin Music Delaware, a Round Hill Music Company\nCourtesy of Sanctuary Records Group Ltd., a BMG Company\n\n### User reviews1.4K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Bizarre but strangely good.\n\nI thought Vivarium was a nice surprise from a movie I didn't expect much of. The story is completely refreshing, i can't recall watching another movie with a similar story so that's already a positive point. There are too much movies with repetitive stories so to see one with an interesting plot it gets my attention. It's a weird story, so if you don't like the bizarre (that's those with the negative reviews) then you should just not watch it, you will be disappointed. Vivarium is the kind of movie that makes me talk out loud during the viewing, what I would do if I was in that case and so on. The plot is intriguing, the decor very minimalistic but that definitely adds to the odd ambiance, the cast is very small but good. Once you're in the story you defintely want to know what the hell is happening and where they are going to? Maybe the end could have been a bit more elaborated but overal it's a movie that deserves a better rating, just for creativity alone.\n\n- deloudelouvain\n- Apr 26, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ18\n\n- How long is Vivarium?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - March 27, 2020 (Ireland)\n- Countries of origin\n    - Ireland\n    - Belgium\n    - Denmark\n- Official site\n    - Official site (Japan)\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Vivero\n- Filming locations\n    - Ardmore Studios, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland\n- Production companies\n    - Fantastic Films\n    - Frakas Productions\n    - Fís Éireann / Screen Ireland\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $4,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $487,625\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 37 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Vivarium (2019) in Australia?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was later found to be benign.\n\n- GoofsThey nail boards on the outside of inward-opening doors. Obviously this isn't going to prevent the doors from being opened, but anything is better than nothing and they're panicking anyway. Moreover, when Merrill asks Graham how they will know if boarding the windows will work, Graham replies, \"Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors\". Graham is implying that if the aliens have trouble with pantry doors, boarding them can only help. Doing so also may give everyone, especially the children, a sense of hope and/or security.\n\n- QuotesGraham Hess: People break down into two groups. When they experience something lucky, group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance. I'm sure the people in group number two are looking at those fourteen lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation is a fifty-fifty. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they're on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. But there's a whole lot of people in group number one. When they see those fourteen lights, they're looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever's going to happen, there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. See what you have to ask yourself is what kind of person are you? Are you the kind that sees signs, that sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky? Or, look at the question this way: Is it possible that there are no coincidences?\n\n- Crazy creditsThe end credits are black text that rolls over a black screen with a\nilluminated blue circle in the middle, instead of the traditional white\ntext on a flat black background.\n\n- Alternate versionsThere is actually an alternative version of this movie, which had different noises for the aliens, prior to release. The noises did not make into the final product. The aliens sounded more demonic than the mostly (although equally scary) alien noises they ended up having. It alone could have gotten the movie an R on the basis of \"terror\" alone. It was mostly edited out to keep the movie from being too dark, although some of the things about the aliens were demonic, and kept in the movie. \"Signs\" got away with a lot for a PG-13 movie. To find them, via the comments, go to the Youtube video to the \"Signs\" trailer, courtesy of user Rob Jackson (the Rotten Videos group's copy of the video; just type \"Signs 2002 trailer Rotten Videos,\" and look for Rob Jackson's comments, they have the links to some of the clips from that version; courtesy of user Kaylin Starlight).\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into Signs: Deleted Scenes (2003)\n\n### User reviews2.5K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Seeing The Small Picture\n\nDuring the course of the film Joaquin Phoenix's character remarks that the situation they're in seems like The War Of The Worlds. It certainly is, but the small picture of it.\n\nWhereas H.G. Wells wrote on the grand scale about what nations and governments were doing to fight an alien invasion, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs concerns itself with the small picture, what is happening in one tiny corner of the world, to be precise Bucks County, Pennsylvania and very specifically Mel Gibson and his family.\n\nOne day farmer Gibson who used to be a minister woke up and found that his cornfield had been systematically decimated and a precise geographical pattern was laid out that could be seen from the air. He concluded it was some kind of prank which would have been the normal reaction of anyone. But when reports of the world wide similar crop defilings and then sitings of shadowy alien figures than the world is in a crisis mode.\n\nBut the world is on the back-burner for Gibson. He was a clergyman but gave it up after the death of his wife who was hit by a drunk driver. He's got his own issues to deal with if he can get himself, his children Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin and brother Joaquin Phoenix through the ordeal. All this without knowing how the world in general is coping. Gibson and the family can only speculate and that's where imaginations run wild.\n\nI have to say that Mel Gibson does a thoroughly good job as an everyman caught up in a global crisis. When War Of The Words was made by George Pal in the Fifties, the leads Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were scientists who had vital information for the survival of the world. The globe is still at risk in Signs, but Mel and his family can't worry about that, just in keeping themselves alive.\n\nSigns is thinking science fiction ranking up there with the best work of Ray Bradbury and John Heinlein. It's both entertaining and engrossing, you can't ask for more from a film.\n\n- bkoganbing\n- Nov 26, 2009\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ6\n\n- When the Aliens communicate, why do they sound like squirrels?\n- What is \"Signs\" about?\n- Is \"Signs\" based on a book?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 15, 2002 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Official site\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Portuguese\n- Also known as\n    - Señales\n- Filming locations\n    - Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Touchstone Pictures\n    - Blinding Edge Pictures\n    - The Kennedy/Marshall Company\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $72,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $227,966,634\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $60,117,080\n    - Aug 4, 2002\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $408,247,917\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 46 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital EX\n    - SDDS\n    - DTS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The movie is an adaptation of the book \"Who Goes there?\" written by John W. Campbell in 1938. The Thing is an alien life-form capable of assimilating and then perfectly mimicking other lifeforms. Each cell is programmed to seek out the cells of other lifeforms. These cells are then devoured, the DNA assimilated, and then mimicked to create a copy so perfect, that even creatures with heightened senses, such as dogs, do not recognize a threat.\n\n## Powers and Stats\n\nTier: 10-C | Varies, from 10-C to 9-B to 9-A, higher by assimilating enough biomass\n\nKey: Singular Cells | Thing Bioforms\n\nName: The Thing\n\nOrigin: The Thing\n\nGender: Inapplicable\n\nAge: Can exist for thousands of years, or more under the right conditions (Was frozen for 100,000 years after its crash on Earth[1])\n\nClassification: Alien, Parasite\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\n- Individual Cells\n- Thing Bioforms\n\nSmall Size (Type 3), Possession, Absorption, Duplication and Biological Manipulation (A single thing cell is capable of taking over an entire organism.[1] Can absorb other organisms into itself[1]), Power Mimicry (If the power is biological or genetic in nature, the Thing should gain those powers during assimilation[1]), Longevity and Resistance to Ice Manipulation (A thing survived for thousands of years encased in ice[1]), Resistance to Acid Manipulation (It should have this, just like its bioforms)\n\nAll previous abilities. Most bioforms have Superhuman Physical Characteristics and Possibly Genius Intelligence (The physical attributes and intellectual capabilities can vary depending on what The Thing has assimilated). Shapeshifting, Body Control, and Natural Weaponry (Things can peel open their face[1], grow tentacles[1], Harpoon-like tendrils[2], large claws[2], and many more), Small Size (Type 3, 2, 1, and 0; Small things should grant this. Some things can disguise themselves as dogs), Acid Manipulation (Some things have been shown to spew[1] corrosive bile[3]), Stealth Mastery (The Thing's ability to perfectly mimic other life already grants it a nearly flawless cover, even among those who are aware of its presence. Blair-Thing was capable of silently ambushing and assimilating Garry[1]), Large Size (Type 0 and 1; Large things tower over the average human[3] with some things reaching colossal sizes[3]), Fusionism, Enhanced Senses (Assimilated a husky[1], so it should have the enhanced senses of a dog), Regeneration (Low-Mid, Low-High via Assimilation; Can regenerate arms[4]. So long as a single cell lives, the thing can assimilate the cells of other biological organisms to reform itself[1]), Immortality (Type 3), Underwater Breathing (Type 2; Some things live in cold waters.[4] Likely doesn't need to breath at all, although this is not completely sure as of yet). Resistance to Acid Manipulation (Can spit acid from inside its body without being affected[1] )\n\nAttack Potency: Below Average Human level (Individual cells can take over and absorb other cells or microscopic organisms) | Varies, from Below Average Human level (Small Things like Blood-Thing should be around this level) to Wall level (Small things like scuttlers are capable of breaking through vent covers[3], which granted this much energy. Human-sized Things are much stronger than scuttlers, and can bite arms off[1], stomp through floors, break ropes, and jump into ceilings[1]. Capable of breaking through wooden walls and break ceilings of the same material[1]) to Small Building level (A large thing broke through a steel wall[3], which granted this much energy), higher by assimilating enough biomass\n\nSpeed: Below Average Human | Varies, from Immobile (Some large thing forms root themselves into the ground[3]) to Below Average Human to Average Human (Can mimic the speed of a normal human) to Superhuman (If it takes the form of the Norwegian dog that it assimilated, should scale to Huskies[1]), higher by assimilating enough biomass\n\nLifting Strength: Below Average Human | Below Average Human to Superhuman (Can easily move a row of chairs with men on it and jump so high that it made a dent in the ceiling[1]. Large Things are stronger than its human-sized bioforms and easily ragdolls a man as it was ripping him apart[3]), higher by assimilating enough biomass\n\nStriking Strength: Below Average Human level | Varies, from Below Average Human level to Wall level to Small Building level, higher by assimilating enough biomass\n\nDurability: Below Average Human level | Varies, from Below Average Human level (Small things should grant this) to Wall level (Can take a barrage of gunfire[1]) to Small Building level (Equal to its attack potency. Generally unphazed by small arms fire[3]), higher by assimilating enough biomass. Regeneration makes it incredibly hard to kill (If you don´t destroy every single cell it can absorb other biological matter to regenerate)\n\nStamina: Superhuman (Can take an incredible amount of damage before going down)\n\nRange: Below Standard Melee Range | Varies, from Below Standard Melee Range to Standard Melee Range to Several Meters (The sheer size of some thing forms should grant this. The tentacles[1] it produces[2] should also grant this) to Tens of Meters (The sheer size of some thing forms should grant this)\n\nStandard Equipment: None notable\n\nIntelligence: Varies from Animalistic to Gifted, possibly Genius (Its intelligence depends entirely on how much mass it currently has and what it has assimilated. Destroyed blood samples to avoid being tested[1] and created a spaceship from scrap[1])\n\nWeaknesses: Susceptible to fire as it destroys the Thing on a molecular level[1]. Are unable to replicate inorganic matter, such as teeth fillings and jewelry[2]. Smaller masses of cells can often only behave instinctually and will attempt to survive even to the detriment of the larger whole. It tends to go dormant in extremely low temperatures, but has no other adverse effects.\n\n## Gallery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorris-Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKennel-Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPalmer-Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWindows-Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBlair-Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThing Cell\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBlood-Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSplit-Face Thing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimulation of the Thing Cell Assimilation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOriginal-Thing\n\n## Notable Matchups\n\n- Victories\n- Losses\n- Inconclusive\n\nVictories:\n\nTomie Kawakami (Tomie) Tomie's profile (The fight took place in India with 2 hours prep for both.

What place tells its own story about your film, whether a particularly challenging location that required production ingenuity or a map reference that inspired you personally, politically or creatively?\n\nNinety percent of our film takes place in one location, which makes that the default answer – a giant house in the middle of nowhere. The whole impetus behind the film’s premise was coming up with something that could unfold in a single location, which automatically places it in the all-in-one-house subgenre of films. I’m a huge fan of this subgenre – everything ranging from The Big Chill to The One I Love, but because there are so many films that share this idea, it was very important to me to make sure that this house felt truly unique, unlike any house we’ve seen before. We started looking for interesting houses across the country, and although the story takes place in an unspecified city, I was really drawn to the idea of shooting in the Pacific Northwest — partially due to the moody overcast vibe it’s famous for, and partially due to growing up a massive fan of Twin Peaks.\n\nOnce we found a house that had a solid foundation, our production designer, Terry Watson, and her team, went to town on it, transforming it from its original form to the house belonging to a deceased artist who had transformed its many rooms into art installations. This was a plot point, but was also an idea that I had come up with early on in the screenwriting phase to justify why the house is full of so many oddities. The house we found had just been put on the market, so we were able to swoop in and shoot there while the owner was away, and he more or less gave us carte blanche to change its appearance during the filming, provided that we’d reset it afterwards. We got a kick out of the fact that the estate manager saw what we did to it towards the end of filming and preferred to show it to prospective buyers in its new state. Although the house is still for sale.\n\nSee all responses to our annual Sundance Question here.\n\n# Related Articles\n\n- True/False Film Fest 2025: Excavation, Therapy, Protest\n\n\n                                    by Vadim Rizov                                    in Festivals &amp;amp; Events\n\n                                    Mar 14, 2025\n- “I Love 16mm”: Deniz Eroglu on The Shipwrecked Triptych\n\n\n                                    by Vadim Rizov                                    in Directors, Festivals &amp;amp; Events, Interviews, Screenwriters\n\n                                    Mar 13, 2025\n- “Intersex People Don’t Need To Be Fixed”: Grace Hughes-Hallett on The Secret of Me\n\n\n                                    by Ritesh Mehta                                    in Directors, Festivals &amp;amp; Events, Interviews, SXSW\n\n                                    Mar 9, 2025\n\n# Featured Articles\n\n- Mad Men: The NYFF’s Go-To Films (II)\n\nBy Howard Feinstein on\n                    Oct 7, 2014\n- The Future of Compression: Google Attempts to Replace H.26X… Again\n\nBy Michael Murie on\n                    Feb 26, 2014\n- Genre at the 2013 Oscars: Live Action Short Death of a Shadow\n\nBy Farihah Zaman on\n                    Feb 22, 2013\n- 2013 IFP Narrative Lab Projects Unveiled\n\nBy Nick Dawson on\n                    Jun 10, 2013\n\n- Tweet\n- Share this post\n- Comments\n\n## The Magazine of Independent Film\n\n- Newsletter\n- Subscribe\n- Issue Archive\n- Advertise\n- Privacy Policy\n- Support\n- Contact Us\n- Site by Vitamin M\n\n© 2025 Filmmaker Magazine.

The whole impetus behind the film’s premise was coming up with something that could unfold in a single location, which automatically places it in the all-in-one-house subgenre of films. I’m a huge fan of this subgenre – everything ranging from The Big Chill to The One I Love, but because there are so many films that share this idea, it was very important to me to make sure that this house felt truly unique, unlike any house we’ve seen before. We started looking for interesting houses across the country, and although the story takes place in an unspecified city, I was really drawn to the idea of shooting in the Pacific Northwest — partially due to the moody overcast vibe it’s famous for, and partially due to growing up a massive fan of Twin Peaks.\n            Once we found a house that had a solid foundation, our production designer, Terry Watson, and her team, went to town on it, transforming it from its original form to the house belonging to a deceased artist who had transformed its many rooms into art installations. This was a plot point, but was also an idea that I had come up with early on in the screenwriting phase to justify why the house is full of so many oddities. The house we found had just been put on the market, so we were able to swoop in and shoot there while the owner was away, and he more or less gave us carte blanche to change its appearance during the filming, provided that we’d reset it afterwards. We got a kick out of the fact that the estate manager saw what we did to it towards the end of filming and preferred to show it to prospective buyers in its new state. Although the house is still for sale.\n        </AdditionalInformation>\n    </movieRecommendation>\n    \n    <relatedArticles>\n        <article>\n            <title>True/False Film Fest 2025: Excavation, Therapy, Protest</title>\n            <author>Vadim Rizov</author>\n            <date>Mar 14, 2025</date>\n        </article>\n        <article>\n            <title>“I Love 16mm”: Deniz Eroglu on The Shipwrecked Triptych</title>\n            <author>Vadim Rizov</author>\n            <date>Mar 13, 2025</date>\n        </article>\n        <article>\n            <title>“Intersex People Don’t Need To Be Fixed”: Grace Hughes-Hallett on The Secret of Me</title>\n            <author>Ritesh Mehta</author>\n            <date>Mar 9, 2025</date>\n        </article>\n    </relatedArticles>\n</article>\n\n\n\n### Summary\nIn the reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the movie recommendation attributes while maintaining the original meaning and context.

(The Dead Green Mummies do not exist.) Pantera has all but disowned their first four albums, this song is track 5 on the fourth of those albums, \"Power Metal.\" The band presumably did not want to be credited with the song (as they don't consider any of their pre-1990 material part of their discography) and made up the name The Dead Green Mummies.\n\n- Alternate versions Changes from the original in the Director's Cut:\n- Changes from the original in the Director's Cut:\n    - 2 mins: As Donnie Rides into town the music has changed from Echo and the Bunnymen's The Killing Moon to INXS's Never Tear Us Apart.\n    - 6 mins: Before Donnie's mother enters his room after dinner she has a short discussion with Elizabeth, asking how she knew Donnie has stopped taking his medication.\n    - 9 mins: As Donnie is awakened by Frank's voice we see a close up of his eye opening with Frank reflected in his iris.

This also fixes the continuity as all the previous names on the list are called before Donnie.\n    - 41 mins: Newscast. Before the emergency PTA meeting Mrs. Farmer and Karen Pomeroy exchange words about Mrs. Farmer's intentions to get The Destructors banned.\n    - 44 mins: Donnie's English class have a poetry day, where Donnie reads a poem about himself and Frank. \"A storm is coming, Frank says a storm that will swallow the children and I will deliver them from the kingdom of pain I will deliver the children back the their doorsteps And send the monsters back to the underground I'll send them back to a place where no-one else can see them Except for me Because I am Donnie Darko\" Karen Pomeroy then asks him who Frank is, Donnie tells her he's a six foot bunny rabbit, and everyone laughs at him.\n    - 53 mins: We see the first of the excerpts from The Philosophy of Time Travel, concerning the tangent universe.\n    - 59 mins: We see Donnie waiting for the school bus a plane flies overhead and everyone looks up nervously, then the second excerpt from The Philosophy of Time Travel appears, Chapter 2, Water and Metal. Behind this transition there is a short new scene where Donnie sits down next to Gretchen and she asks him why he has blood on his neck.\n    - 61 mins: We see Donnie's parents out for dinner, discussing what they should do about disciplining him after the incident with Mrs. Farmer. Their opinions are wildly different, and they joke about getting divorced.\n    - 62 mins: Whilst the parents are out to dinner we see that Donnie and Elizabeth have been sitting at home carving the pumpkins seen later in the film.\n    - 64 mins: Another shot of Donnie's eye opening, along with footage of waves breaking on a beach.\n    - 65 mins: We see Donnie and Gretchen in an arcade, the scene is overlaid by chapter 7 from the book, The Manipulated Living.\n    - 66 mins: As Donnie watches Jim Cunningham's seminar at the school his perception changes, he sees things sped up, and mentions to Gretchen that he is travelling through time. The seminar now goes on longer, with extra scenes before Donnie steps up to the mic.\n    - 71 mins: Donnie and Gretchen go to visit Roberta Sparrow, there is nobody home but Donnie checks her mailbox and is inspired to write to her.

His dad tells him that no matter how crazy he thinks he is, he should always say what's on his mind.\n    - 90 mins: As we see Jim Cunningham arrested on TV the voiceover on the TV is slightly different.\n    - 91 mins: Karen Pomeroy's firing is slightly shortened.\n    - 92 mins: Karen gives one of her last classes, after the students watch a section of Watership Down they discuss Fiver (the rabbit)'s visions, and how trusting those visions of the end of the world would save the warren. Gretchen and Donnie argue in the class about the meaning of them. Donnie doesn't see the point of crying over a dead rabbit, Gretchen tells Donnie he missed the point, and Karen Pomeroy tells the class that the Deus Ex Machina is what saved the rabbits.\n    - 97 mins: Donnie says goodbye to his mom in the street as she goes to LA with Sparkle Motion.\n    - 98 mins: As Karen clears out her desk, her talk with Donnie is different, she suggests on a Friday night Donnie should be out scaring old people.\n    - 103 mins: Donnie talks with his doctor about his belief in God, and she tells him he can stop taking his medication as they are placebos.\n    - 106 mins: There is an overlay of Chapter 9, the Ensurance Trap.\n    - 110 mins: As Donnie walks around the party, observing people's channels, there is another montage of his eye, as if he were putting all the clues together that lead him to thinking he should go to Grandma Death's house.\n    - 114 mins: As Donnie is pinned down with the knife to his throat outside Grandma Death's house, it is now very clear he is saying Deus Ex Machina.\n    - 116 mins: Roberta Sparrow tells Donnie a storm is coming, and that he must hurry.\n    - 118 mins: We see a montage of things reflected in Donnie's eye as Frank counts down to the end of the world.\n    - 120 mins: Another montage as we see the universe collapsing and rewinding as Donnie travels back through time.\n    - 123 mins: The final overlay is of chapter 12, Dreams, which explains why everyone seems to be having a sleepless night as Mad World plays.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into The Phoenix Portal (2005)\n\n- SoundtracksThe Killing Moon\nWritten by Will Sergeant, Ian McCulloch, Les Pattinson and Pete DeFreitas (as Pete De Freitas)\nPerformed by Echo &amp;amp; The Bunnymen\nCourtesy of Sire Records/Warner Music U.K. Ltd.\nBy arrangement with Warner Special Products\n\n### User reviews2.5K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Disturbing. Confusing. Twisted. Everything a movie should be.\n\nDonnie Darko is no movie. It's an experience that transcends anything you have ever felt in front of a screen. Once it's over, you won't stop thinking about it. The music will stay in your head, the ideas will keep you awake, and the characters will stay alive. This is everything a movie should movie. No one should miss this. Though there are flaws, the incredible crafting of the film will distract you from them. Go see it.\n\nJake Gylenhall and Patrick Swayze are brilliant. Richard Kelly may have screwed himself with this. Why? Because this is probably the greatest movie he will ever make. If not, Kelly, you are my new favorite filmmaker.

It's a puzzle equal to that which the movie presents its audience, because this isn't your standard horror movie. It has more in common with plot-twisting movies such as \"Momento\" and \"The Machinist\" than the gory likes of \"Halloween\" or \"Ghost Ship\". \n\nPerhaps a good start is offer some praise to the director Christopher Smith whose work i've been a fan of since \"Creep\". I also greatly enjoyed his follow-up \"Severence\", but \"Triangle\" is easily his most mature effort so far; and the entire movie has an almost dream-like atmosphere to it. It certainly looks beautiful and the haunting music adds to this ambiance.\n\nMelissa George, who plays the central role here, is quietly impressive; she's never really been an actress who has stood out to me in her previous roles, and so it was a pleasant surprise to see her rising to the occasion of taking center stage. It's only a shame that her character is so haunted and inaccessible. This isn't George's fault; the role is written in a way which keeps her detached not only from the other characters but also from the moviegoers. She's constantly aloof and distracted which can be initially annoying; it's hard to care for a character which you can't warm to.\n\nI would certainly applaud the makers for attempting something different to the standard horror story (although, I do admit that it is very similar in theme to one other recent movie that you'll probably see mentioned a few times in the forum for \"Triangle\") and I certainly enjoyed the experience. I'd recommend staying away from learning too much about the plot beforehand (the trailer, in particular, gives far too much away) if at all possible.\n\n\"Triangle\" is very much like a movie-length version of a \"Twilight Zone\" episode but its also a very flawed piece. There's an intelligence at work in the script; the way in which the pieces of the puzzle are presented to the audience is done in a skilled manner but it also suffers from thinking it's far cleverer than it actually is. There are plot holes to be found by those who dwell on the story, and the ending isn't quite as neat as the movie believes it to be.\n\nStill, this is an impressive effort and well worth checking out (especially if you're a fan of the two superior movies mentioned earlier - \"Momento\" and \"The Machinist\"). In a world in which cinematic horror tends to involve torture and cheap shocks, it's nice to find a more psychological effort that looks for other ways to creep under your skin.\n\n- Mr\\_Saxon\n- Nov 23, 2009\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ22\n\n- How long is Triangle?Powered by Alexa\n- Why is the film called Triangle?\n- Was Triangle influenced or inspired by Timecrimes?\n- The sinister and determined Jess with the blood-covered face: where did she come from?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 16, 2009 (United Kingdom)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - Australia\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Tam Giác Quỷ\n- Filming locations\n    - Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia\n- Production companies\n    - Icon Entertainment International\n    - Framestore\n    - UK Film Council\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $12,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $1,333,377\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 39 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Triangle (2009) in Australia?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Released on March 21st in the US, it instantly became the highest‑grossing movie of that month, ahead of 300: Rise Of An Empire. Both were scored by Junkie XL.\n\nA pseudonym for Dutchman Tom Holkenborg, Junkie XL is best known as an EDM musician and producer, who has six solo albums to his name. Back in 2002, he scored a worldwide hit with his remix of Elvis Presley's 1968 song 'A Little Less Conversation'. Holkenborg's most recent solo album, Synthesized, dates from 2012, and it appears that he has since been on a one‑man mission to single‑handedly corner the market for scoring dystopian Hollywood action movies, as he also wrote the music for the thriller Paranoia (2013), contributed heavily to the score for Man Of Steel (2013), and is currently writing the music for the fourth Mad Max movie, Fury Road, which is scheduled for release in 2015.\n\nHolkenborg explains that his flurry of major Hollywood film scores is the result of a deliberate strategy on his part, starting with him moving to LA in 2002 to pursue a career in film music. \"Throughout my career I have always wanted to do many different things at the same time, so I have been an artist releasing solo albums and singles, collaborated with other artists, have engaged in songwriting, production, done remixes, written music for commercials and video games, and so on. I moved to Los Angeles to really master the craft and art of film scoring. This was the result of me being really impressed with how someone used one of my tracks in a movie in 1995. To learn more about movie scoring I did bits and pieces in the film industry after moving to LA that were not so glamorous, like chopping up samples when assisting Harry Gregson‑Williams, while I, at the same time, had a worldwide hit with my remix of the Elvis Presley song. That was a bizarre situation!\n\n\"I gradually got more and more deeply involved in the film‑scoring world, and worked, for example, on the Matrix trilogy and the video game The Matrix: Path Of Neo. I also occasionally worked with Hans Zimmer and in 2009, when I began working with him more closely, he invited me to rent a space at his Remote Control facility. During the last two years, the film thing has completely taken over. I made a choice to focus on that, because I am 46, and you can be a film composer until you're 96. I don't see myself touring and jumping up and down on a stage at 96, so it was an obvious choice. I really enjoyed my years in the electronic music scene, but it's way more challenging and interesting for me to work with a director on a movie than to try to keep up with the flavour of the week in the EDM world. I am a sound freak, and a software and plug‑in freak, and I find that I can go nuts with those things when film scoring. Some of the things I do are too dark, too ominous, too scary for a music CD, but they find a perfect purpose in a film score, and for me that is really satisfying.\n\n\"I do most of my work at my studio at home, but sometimes work at Remote because of the excellent acoustics there, and the fact that Hans [Zimmer] is almost next door, and if we work together on a project it makes sense to be close to each other. In addition to that the three rooms at Remote Control are extremely important because they are used by my assistants to deal with the constant picture changes. The cues that I write are not going to stay the same for the entire project, because the movie is constantly being cut, scenes are deleted or extended, a flashback may suddenly be thrown in, and so on. Right at the end, the studio may not be happy with the ending, and a change is made and for this they have to change the story and re‑shoot parts of the movie. All these things affect the score, and I would say that the bulk of work in film scoring goes into adapting to the resulting changes. So when I have written a cue, and suddenly four seconds are cut, one of my assistants will load the cue, make the cut, and make sure it musically still makes sense. I may go over it as well and make suggestions. But the work that my assistants do is crucial. It'd be impossible to score a movie all on your own. The workload would just be too heavy.”\n\n## Multi‑tasking\n\nHolkenborg's workload was particularly heavy at the time he was scoring Divergent, as for part of the time he was also working on the score for 300. One of the consequences was that Holkenborg, who normally mixes his own scores, enlisted the help of one of Hollywood's most respected scoring mixers to complete the score of Divergent. Enter Alan Meyerson, who has worked with Hans Zimmer since 1994 and also has a studio at Remote Control. Meyerson and Zimmer have collaborated on 200 movies, and Meyerson has an imposing credit list that includes movies like Man Of Steel, Iron Man, the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, Inception, The Dark Knight, Kung‑Fu Panda 1 &amp; 2, Despicable Me 1 &amp; 2, The Last Samurai, Gladiator and Hannibal. Man Of Steel marked the first time Meyerson and Holkenborg worked together.\n\nSo that's what happened to all the Minimoogs... this synth rack in Holkenborg's studio contains, from the top, no fewer than four Studio Electronics 'MIDImoog' rackmounted Minimoogs, along with the same company's own SE1 and Code synths, and a Cwejman S1.In the case of Divergent, Meyerson helped Holkenborg with recording additional drums and recording the live orchestra and doing a final scoring mix. Meyerson was the perfect man for the job, because he has a background in rock and club mixing, having worked with Arthur Baker and Shep Pettibone in the 1980s and in the same decade also clocking up music mix credits that include Bryan Ferry, New Order, Etta James and OMD. Meyerson has a reputation in Hollywood as the scoring mixer with the most aggressive orchestral sound, and his approach fitted Holkenborg's in‑your‑face score perfectly. Meyerson calls the score for Divergent \"the most aggressive‑sounding score I have ever worked on”.\n\nHolkenborg: \"Every movie has a different sound and approach, and like with every other movie, I began by taking some time to think about what I wanted to do with Divergent, not necessarily musically, but conceptually. When we started there was no director's cut yet, so I read the script a few times and had long conversations with the director [Neil Burger] and the producers, and from that came up with ideas for the score. Divergent is shot as a first‑person narrative, ie. everything in the movie is told from the main character's perspective [Beatrice Prior, played by Shailene Woodley, PT], and the music needed to reflect this. Most movies have more of a third‑person perspective, and this means that the music is constantly commenting on the things you see on the screen. For example, the moment the bad guy appears, you have some scary music. But when a movie is shot from a first‑person perspective, the music should reflect the responses of that person to what she experiences.\n\nMost of Junkie XL's sound design begins with audio, either generated by conventional instruments or synths. The latter include his two Analogue Solutions modulars; also visible are a Dave Smith Prophet 08 and Mopho, Roger Linn Adrenalinn, Roland JP8080 and XV3080, Novation DrumStation and Jomox Xbase 09.\"The story in a nutshell is that the main character has to make a very difficult choice when she is 16 as to what group she is going to join. The test she takes to help her decide is inconclusive, and means that she's a divergent, and is at risk of being killed, because divergents are seen as a danger in this society. She has to keep her divergent nature a secret, and the people around her do not know what she is going through. The only people that can root for her are the audience, and for this reason the music needs to be welcoming so it connects the audience with her. This is why the score starts small and an acoustic guitar plays the main theme. As the movie plays in a dystopian future, it would have been easy to have a synthesized score full of paranoia and fear, but this would have made the music colder and would not have connected the audience to the main character. The girl goes through varies experiences during the movie, many of them full of fear and anxiety, and in the process she matures and become a grown‑up woman, so the music needs to mature also, while it constantly comments on the things she experiences. In addition, the group she eventually joins is very tribal, which is why there's a lot of drumming in the score with a tribal vibe.”\n\n## Kyma: Chameleon\n\nAccording to Holkenborg, once he has decided on the general approach of the score, his next step is sound design. This he mostly does in Kyma, which is \"basically an extremely complicated version of Reaktor. You can do really crazy stuff with it. It allows live morphing between sounds and it allows you to calculate FFT envelopes and do very complicated vocoder functions, and so on. I then turn these sounds into Kontakt instruments, with very complex scripting, so they become playable instruments that I can use to write music. I use people who are really good at scripting for Kontakt, and the programming that we use in our sound libraries is as advanced, if not more advanced, than scripts used in commercial libraries. This is one of the reasons why we need these huge PCs with all the processing power. The cool thing about sound designing for movies is that I get to work with the sound‑effect guys, who are crossing over into the music world. Sound design, sound effects, and the score go hand in hand. For example, there are lots of train scenes in Dive\n\nrgent, and they sync'ed all the train track sounds up with my rhythms, which worked really well.”\n\nAs with many movies these days, particularly those aimed at a youth market, Divergent features a number of pop songs, in this case specifically written for the movie. They feature the likes of Ellie Goulding, Pia Mia, Snow Patrol, Tame Impala, M83, Skrillex and others. As a result, Holkenborg was not only interacting with the sound‑effect department, but also had to take the pop songs into account while writing the score. \"After I've done the sound design I start to write the actual musical parts, and this includes the orchestral arrangements. Because I am classically trained I write these myself. When writing the music I have to consider the licensed songs, because there are sections where the songs and the score overlap. So I may have to write a string overlay for a song, for example. Other than that I had no dealings with the licensed songs, but I did work with Ellie Goulding, who sang melodies I had written on my score. The female voice functioned almost like the inner voice of the main character and this was very effective in the movie.\n\n\"Once I had written all the arrangements and recorded my tracks, I invited Alan to help me with recording and mixing the orchestra. We happen to really like each other, and his mixing is impeccable. He has his own style, which added a unique magic to the sound and mix of Divergent.”\n\n## Feel Factor\n\nMeyerson's first assignment was to record additional percussion samples, which took place at Remote Control. \"Junkie had done all his programming and writing, and wanted to have some extra percussion recordings to make the percussion more transient and get more of a live feel. We had a percussionist called Satnam Ramgotra come in for five or six days for a lot of drum kit and ethnic percussion recordings. The microphones that I used for the latter were two condensers with great transient responses: the DPA 4011, which has a very high‑velocity small capsule, and the Sennheiser MKH800, which is one of the best all‑round mics that I know and that can take a tremendous amount of level. I have nine of them. Both mics can handle the sharp attacks of percussion hits that you usually use a dynamic microphone for, yet you still get the dynamic range and frequency response of a condenser. And the 4011 can take 150dB of level!\n\n\"I had a more or less standard setup for recording the kit, and modified it because in essence I recorded the kit in mono, and then panned the mono recordings in quad — ie. left, right, surround left, and surround right. Satnam would play the same part four times, exact enough so the combined image worked well, but the slight differences really gave it dimension. Much of the general score mixing that I do is, in effect, in quad, because you don't want to clog up the centre channel, which is used extensively for dialogue, and also, very few of the instruments that I record produce frequencies in the sub range. So when I deliver 5.1 stems to the re‑recording mixer [for the final mix], they often only contain quad information. On the stereo mixes you can hear two drum kits on the left and two on the right, but in the movie theatre you'll hear them from four sides. Because I was recording in mono, my overhead mic was just one ribbon Royer 122V, with a decent amount of compression on it, and I had a bass drum mic and a bass drum sub, which I made myself from a Yamaha NS10M speaker, and a few more mics.\n\nAlan Myerson at Remote Control.\n\n\"Because Junkie had already programmed a tremendous amount of percussion, I wasn't looking for the entire sound, I was mainly trying to get as much of a transient response as possible. We wanted to make things more physical. So I used my Grace 801 preamps — I have 32 channels of them — which also have an incredible transient response, and I set the level a little lower than I normally would, so that the transients really came through. Once I had the transient responses the way I wanted them, I compressed the shit out of them, using the McDSP multi‑band compressor, which allowed me to accentuate different frequency aspects of the drums. After this I put the sound through a Waves SSL emulation compressor plug‑in to thicken up the sound a bit. I wasn't soloing things, but listening to it against Junkie's stuff, just cranking up the threshold of the compressor so it really added many additional colours and filled all the holes where the transients could go. I recorded everything into Pro Tools in 96k and then gave the recordings back in 44.1 to Junkie, who worked with them further in his sessions.”\n\n## Up In The AIR\n\nFollowing the percussion recording sessions at Remote Control, Holkenborg and Meyerson travelled to AIR Lyndhurst in London, where the latter recorded the orchestra. \"I have a substantial microphone collection, and several mics have been modified to have slightly higher outputs and to be slightly more sensitive to particular frequency ranges. I have three Dirk Brauner VM1 mics that have been modified by Klaus Heyne [one of the US's top microphone specialists] for my purposes, one having a slightly richer mid‑range for recording cellos, one having an especially silky and smooth high end for recording violins, and so on. I also have plate‑loaded Royer ribbon mics that run 6dB hotter than standard Royers, to keep the noise floor down. The mods allow me to get super‑clean signals on my woodwinds and orchestral percussion.\n\n\"I did not bring these modified mics to AIR, though I did bring six of my Sennheiser MKH800 mics, which are standard issues. The advantage of recording at AIR is that the studio is incredible, and it does have an excellent collection of mics, of course. We had a full, 90‑piece orchestra and when I record that, I normally look at it from three different heights, though I had four heights at AIR. At the lowest level are the spot mics, which to me give the least interesting sound, because they aren't really blending together. Then I have a set of mid‑distance mics at eight feet, consisting of left‑centre‑right AKG C12s on the strings and left‑centre‑right Neumann M49s on the brass. When I'm trying to get an aggressive sound, I use those the most. You get the closeness, but not the spottiness, and I can add air from the next level, which is at the height of a standard Decca Tree, 11 feet. At this level I had five mics plus two surrounds, so seven mics in total: left, centre, right, wide left, wide right, surround left and surround right, and they capture the general sound of the room. These were mostly my Sennheisers. In addition to this I also had mics high up the galleries at AIR, at about 25 feet, just for reverb. When you record at AIR and place your ambient mics well, you hardly have to add any digital reverb later on. I'd say that 50 percent of the orchestra sound came from the eight‑foot mics, 30 percent from the 11‑foot mics, 10 percent from the spot mics, and another 10 percent from the ambient mics.\n\n\"I ran the mics through Neve preamps going straight into Pro Tools — the Neve 88VR desk in the studio was mainly for monitoring — and was printing 5.0 mixes of each of the orchestral sections as I went. It's a really fast and efficient way to work, and if I'm unhappy with the balance later on, I can always unwind the mix, as I call it, and readjust things. As things go down I am only ever listening to the 5-mix. Usually these live mixes are pretty good, and they give me a reliable impression of what's going down. Just like with the percussion, I then pre‑mixed everything and gave Junkie quad mixes that he could integrate in his sessions and work with. He could process the orchestra the way he wanted it and find the balance between programmed and live material that he was looking for, and so on. For the final scoring mix I then took what we call his synth masters, and combined them with my original orchestra sessions. So we, in effect, had two different perspectives on the same material in terms of processing and mixing.”\n\n## Looking For Aggression\n\nMeyerson conducted his final scoring mix for Divergent at Remote Control Studio A, using a Euphonix System 5, his favourite ATC monitors, and three Pro Tools rigs. \"One rig would have the London orchestral session, the second would have Junkie's synth masters, and the third would be the mix print session. At this stage I was adding quite a bit of processing on the orchestra, because we wanted it to blend in with Junkie's incredible sounds. I added harmonic distortion using plug‑ins like the Nomad Factory Magnetic 'reel‑to‑reel audio tape warmer' and the Waves Kramer PIE compressor, which is a plug‑in I really like. This added some more harmonic content and an analogue‑like sensibility. I also used the [SoundToys] Decapitator and PSP Mix Saturator on the brass to give it more edge. Some of the cues had high‑energy, high‑action music, with frenetic percussion, and in these cases in particular I needed to make sure that the orchestra still cut through. Another helpful tool to achieve this was my six channels of outboard Manley Massive Passive EQ, with which I added high and low end, as well as multi‑band compression from the McDSP 4000, which allowed me to push certain parts of the sound forward at different times. I spent quite a bit of time messing around with the mid‑range on the compressor until I found something that was aggressive‑sounding enough to sit comfortably with Junkie's stuff.\n\n\"For reverb I used my six outboard Bricastis. I delivered strings and brass to the re‑recording mixer at the soundstage in separate stems, and Bricasti one and two would give me my left, centre, right on the strings, and Bricasti three my strings surround left and surround right, and the same with my Bricastis four, five and six for the brass. Because of the complexity of a film, and the fact that they're dealing with sound effects, dialogue, music, sound design, we give the re‑recording mixer stems of everything, so he or she can separate things out and re‑edit when necessary, depending on how the music interacts with the dialogue and sound effects. When the re‑recording mixer opens my mix session and leaves everything at zero, he will have my final mix.\n\n\"Most of the time re‑recording mixers don't alter the scoring mix very much — they mostly just want to be able to have the 5.1 stems for editing. There'll be a last‑minute picture change, and the director may decide he wants the strings a bit lower in the new version. Having separate stems allows the re‑recording mixer to edit the score as required. With regards to the stereo mix for the soundtrack album, Junkie used my initial orchestral mixes for that, and mixed those in with his material. An Atmos [that latest hi‑tech Dolby surround playback environment] mix of Divergent was also done, but I don't get involved with that. I will have conversations with re‑recording mixers about what kind of separation they need, and I may add a separate stereo reverb track for use in Atmos, but the truth is, unless you're in a dubbing stage that has all the different formats and that has the $1 million invested for Atmos playback, you can't do much more. So I just tend to deliver my mixes in 5.1, at 48kHz.”\n\nWith the topic once again returning to all the different formats that Holkenborg and Meyerson are dealing with, there's some reflection on the discrepancy between the ballooning complexity of audio in the film world and the decrease in audio quality in consumer music formats. \"There are two aspects to that issue,” Holkenborg muses. \"First of all, you have to go to these lengths to stay relevant in film scoring. All the people I work with, the film producers and directors, are extremely knowledgeable, and they are into technical details. I also do these things to satisfy my own quest to deliver the best I can, while I am at my peak. I have always done that. But you see in every art form today that it takes longer and longer to make something unique, and yet the public just consumes the highlights. While the composer's process is becoming more complex, more and more people are losing their capacity to hear details in a score. But that shouldn't stop you from doing the very best you can, for yourself, but also to get heard. You still need to put your heart and soul into a piece of music to get it played by consumers, even if it is just a couple of times. If you didn't, you would get nowhere at all. And you always hope that it will be different, that the music you create will become a classic, that your film score will become timeless, in the way that 'Yesterday' by the Beatles is. You can't predict or influence that, but you never know, so you try as hard as you can.”\n\n## The Ultimate Template\n\nTom Holkenborg received his nickname 'Junkie' nearly 20 years ago because of his addictive obsession with music and music technology, and expanded on it by adding the XL extension, which stands for 'expanding limits'. The obsession has found the perfect outlet in film scoring, with Holkenborg composing on a truly industrial scale. He has four studios — one at home and three at Remote Control — each containing identical setups featuring racks of custom‑made PCs with overclocked quad‑core 3.5GHz processors, hundreds of gigabytes of RAM and super‑fast hard drives.\n\nThese PCs get so hot that they are placed in separate air‑conditioned rooms. They run Cubase and Pro Tools in tandem, and are \"loaded with every synth, mix plug‑in, and orchestral library known to man,” as well as Vienna Ensemble Pro, Symbolic Sound's Kyma, Native Instruments' Kontakt and the SAM sampling system written for Hans Zimmer by erstwhile SOS employee Mark Wherry. The single most astounding detail of Holkenborg's setup is that his basic Cubase template contains 2800 tracks. \"The reason my template has so many tracks is that I want everything loaded at all times, so I can easily and instantly switch to another sound or another articulation when I need to. For example, I have over the last 15 years recorded a very extensive drum library, of which I regularly use more than 300 instruments, and just recently I did another extensive drum sampling session for the Mad Max movie, for which I sampled another 200 instruments. So that's 500 drum tracks that are pre‑loaded with track settings, outputs, plug‑ins, and so on.\n\n\"In addition there are all my strings and brass libraries, all with elaborate articulations, which mean that my template pre‑loads 300 tracks just for the strings, and 100 just for the brass. I will have eight, nine or 10 MIDI controllers assigned to each unique library track, which give me all the different mic positions and the velocities and the key mapping, and so on. In fact, the VST returns for my Vienna Symphonic Library alone consist of 900 tracks, with aux sends and compressors and Transient Designers, and distortion plug‑ins! And it just keeps on going. The reason I need to pre‑load them all, rather than start with an empty session and load things one by one as I need them, is that the latter process could easily take an hour and a half. When you're scoring a movie you need to be extremely flexible and extremely fast. I don't have the time to load things while working or while the director is in the room and I want to quickly show him an idea.\n\n\"Of course, you don't need 2800 tracks to make great music. All you need today is a laptop with a DAW and a couple of plug‑ins and off you go. When I made my Junkie XL albums I never worked with templates. I would start every session from scratch, because that is what being an artist is about: you're creative in every aspect of what you're doing and you make decisions as you go. But when you're scoring a movie, you need to build your template before you start writing. The orchestral stuff is a given, so that's in every template I create, but I also do a lot of sound design, and work out guitar, bass, synth and drum sound palettes, and I can take three to four weeks working on the sounds I want to use for a movie. The cool thing is that this creates a sonic consistency throughout the score. Once I have sorted out the sound design and adjusted the template accordingly, I am ready to write music, and I may in reality often end up only using 300 tracks or so. But once again, the main reason for the huge templates and the track counts is the flexibility, which is essential, because I can at any stage, at the request of the director or the studio, even during the last day of the final mix, be asked to change the smallest detail in the score.”\n\nSeen in this light, Holkenborg's eye‑watering track counts are part of a more general effort to streamline the entire production process. His main MIDI keyboard is the Doepfer LMK4, and his setup also incorporates a JL Cooper Fader Master, two Cubase controllers and an iPad. Most of his sound design is \"based on acoustic recordings or organic sounds from analogue synths”, and so his studio contains 30 guitars and various hardware synths, with the most eye‑catching pieces of kit being the Analogue Systems 3500 and 8500 synths with a French Connection keyboard, and an upright piano that he has improved by, er, taking an axe to it. A fertile source of sound‑design material is Tom Holkenborg's 'piano from hell'. The woodwork has been removed to facilitate access to the strings.\n\n\"I bought the piano when doing the score for 300, and used an axe to remove the outsides until all I was left with was the metal inside, the harp, which I put in a new enclosure. As a result the acoustic quality of the piano is entirely gone. It's like an electric guitar when you play the strings now — there's hardly any noise. I use electric guitar and other pick‑ups that I place on the strings in different positions, and they go through ART valve preamps, and sometimes through other amplifiers, and eventually I record the instrument into Cubase. I play the piano with sticks or mallets or brushes. It's a very unique‑sounding instrument that I also used on the score for Divergent.\n\n\"The Analogue Systems synths suffer from all the down sides of working with analogue, like oscillators that go out of tune, and envelopes that don't quite work the way they should, but all that adds extra magic. It's fantastic. One of the modules I have is a direct copy of the first Fairlight sampler, and another module converts MIDI to CV and CV to MIDI, so I can hook the synth up to Cubase and other keyboards.”\n\n## Thumbs Up\n\nWhere budgets routinely run into tens of millions of dollars, as they do in film production, data security becomes a vital concern, as Tom Holkenborg explains. \"We have everything wired in the studios at Remote Control with yellow cables for the Vienna Ensemble connection and blue for networking, and there's one massive cable that runs through the studio that's for going online, and that we only connect for system updates or to download plug‑ins. At that point, the drives with sensitive data, ie. music and pictures, are disconnected and put into a safe. To get data from my home studio to my Remote Control systems, I work with thumbprint‑protected portable drives. Only two people have access to these drives, usually me and one of my assistants, so even if a drive gets lost, other people won't be able to access it. It reads your thumbprint and then there's a process with three points at which you need to enter a pretty complicated WPA2 password, and only after that do you have access to the data. If someone tries to bypass the security the data gets destroyed.”\n\n## Revolving DAWs\n\nTom Holkenborg has used various different sequencing packages over the years. \"I have all the different DAWs: Logic, Fruity Loops, Ableton Live — I used Ableton for my live shows. The thing is, because I am such a software and plug‑in freak, I ask myself regularly: am I working with the software that gives me what I need at this specific point in time? I began working with Steinberg Pro 24 in 1984, and in the late '80s, compared Notator and Cubase, and chose the latter. Three years later Logic came out, and I switched to that. In 1997 or '98 I switched to Pro Tools, and to audio editing instead of MIDI sequencing. Because I have a sample background, manipulating the timing of audio notes was way more interesting to me than manipulating MIDI notes. When I moved to LA I wanted to be able to sequence again, because I was working with orchestral samples, so I went back to Logic, since MIDI did not work well in Pro Tools. I regularly compared Logic with Cubase and Ableton, and when Cubase 6 came out, I went over to that. It's rough on my assistants,Tom Holkenborg's Cubase projects are far too large to print in their entirety. The excerpts shown are from a single cue, titled '6M32'. Holkenborg: \"This cue has roughly 350 tracks. You can see at the top that I put in extensive markers. I enter these before I start writing, at the points at which I think the music will be changing. Underneath is the tempo map. The parts underneath that are the first half of the sound design that I created for this arrangement.” who need to adjust every time, but I feel blessed to have seen how Cubase and Notator started and to this day I can see things in Logic that come from the Notator days and recognise the origins of Cubase and Pro Tools.\n\n\"The main reason for me using Cubase today is the way it handles MIDI, which is phenomenal. When you're writing multiple string parts, the way it allows you to see all parts at the same time and place information in the foreground and background, and how control data can be linked to specific MIDI notes so that when you copy it the control data goes with it, and how you can lock the control data in the expression map, so when you throw the parts into Sibelius the articulations are automatically printed, is just great.\n\n\"Also, when using Cubase and Kontakt on the PC platform it can easilyThis shot of Cubase's Key Editor shows part of the drum programming for the '6M32' cue.  handle my 2800‑track templates. Sampling is my main source for making music, and being able to have multiple samplers running at the same time has always been a very important part of my setup. For whatever reason, Kontakt as an Audio Unit grabs way more processing power on a Mac than [the VST version] on PC. When I work with Cubase on a Mac and open 40 or 50 Kontakt samples, my processing will be at the computer's limit, whereas on my PC I can have 200 samples open and still be only at 20 percent of my CPU. Plug‑ins in VST mode work much more efficiently in PCs than in Macs. On top, Logic has completely dropped the ball with version X. I don't know what they are thinking. Logic 6 to 9 were very exciting compared to Cubase at the time, but since Logic has moved more into the Apple sphere, its cutting edge has disappeared.\n\n\"I run Cubase and Pro Tools in sync all the time, connected via MIDI Time Code and a MADI card that allows me to send up to 192 channels from Cubase to Pro Tools. I do about 80 percent of mixing and processing in Cubase, and then deliver up to 60‑70 stems to Pro Tools where I can finesse things further. It's sometimes quicker to do things in Pro Tools. For example, suppose I have 25 string tracks and I decide that I want to take down the volume of all of them by 2dB. In Cubase I'd need to go into the MIDI for each part and adjust the expression and volume, whereas in Pro Tools I can just turn the group fader down.\n\nTom Holkenborg: \"This is the Pro Tools session that's running in sync with the Cubase session that can be seen in the Cubase screenshots. You can see the track list on the left, which is all the Cubase outputs coming in. The Cubase mixer page with all the meters and old subgroups has matching inputs in Pro Tools. It's an elaborate system, but it works really well. You can see some of the meters in Pro Tools clipping, because I like that sound. The scroll bar at the bottom shows you that this is only part of the session — there are about 200 stem tracks in total in this session.”\"Also, when I want to deliver a cue to the mix stage I can just hit print in Pro Tools and everything will go down at the same time, and it's time‑stamped so when the editor imports the tracks they immediately will snap to the right spot in the timeline and will sync up to the picture again. However, Cubase is also able to bounce off all these tracks at the same time, with the SMPTE information embedded. The reason I'm using Pro Tools in addition to Cubase is not because it's the industry standard and fantastic for mixing purposes, which it is, but because of the sound. For me mixing in Cubase is fine, but I prefer to do the summing in Pro Tools. If you drive things with strong transients slightly into the red, Pro Tools adds slight distortion and an additional punch that I really like. Summing in Pro Tools adds some magic that I can't get from any other DAW.\n\n\"I have a very large setup, and if it is stable, you run it for as long as possible. The last thing you want to do when you're in This Pro Tools Mix window screen capture shows the final stem session Alan Myerson delivered to the re‑recording mixer. The six live string tracks have sends called 'Str FX Rvb', which is a reverb created by Myerson. The brass tracks further down, 'Ad13‑15', have the Bricasti reverb on the sends. The brass stem tracks are muted in this screenshot.the middle of a project is to update your software, like for example go to Cubase 7 and find that suddenly some plug‑ins don't work and some functions aren't there any more. For this reason I'm still on Cubase 6, and an early release of Pro Tools 10. We also run an early release of Windows 7, which we can do because none of the computers go online. The computers in all four studios are on 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and they never crash. I changed my setup after Man Of Steel 14 months ago and none of the four rooms has had a crash since then. The only thing we do is restart sometimes,just to clear the memory. I used to be one of the technology trendsetters, an early adopter, and would buy software the day it came out, so I have dealt with a lot of the initial bugs that came with all these programs. It's really nice to have had three years of not running ahead of the pack in terms of new software developments.\n\n## SOS Competitions\n\n## Readers' Ads\n\n- View all ads\n- Create free ad\n\n## On the same subject\n\n- How To Finish A Mix March 2025\n- Talkback: Tobin Jones March 2025\n- How I Got That Sound: Phil Manzanera March 2025\n- Bon Jovi March 2025\n- Using Tube And Tape Plug-Ins | SOS Podcast March 2025\n\nSign Up TO\n\n\tSOS Newsletters\n\n## Latest SOS Videos\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New forum posts\n\n- Re: Sending 5 drum mics to one port on a small mixer for a live show?\n\nCochraneDrumTutor &amp;gt;\n15 Mar 2025, 14:27Live Sound | Performance\n- Re: A fun mic comparison\n\namanise &amp;gt;\n15 Mar 2025, 13:52Recording: Gear + Techniques\n- Re: Sending 5 drum mics to one port on a small mixer for a live show?\n\nThe Elf &amp;gt;\n15 Mar 2025, 13:40Live Sound | Performance\n- Re: My quest for Quadraphony -- journal and audio samples\n\nBen Asaro &amp;gt;\n15 Mar 2025, 12:40Keyboards + Synthesizers\n- Re: A fun mic comparison\n\nDrew Stephenson &amp;gt;\n15 Mar 2025, 12:05Recording: Gear + Techniques\n\n## Active topics\n\n- Sending 5 drum mics to one port on a small mixer for a live show?\n- Free Boz Master Keys VST Piano\n- NatLife Sounds - 30% Off All Synthesiser Presets\n- Tone Empire Releases E-Lux : Luxury Electro Optical Compressor\n- Yamaha 03D Firmware Needed - BLOCK TABLE FILE Error\n- Serious Techno Sample Pack (Boris Brejcha Style)\n- Bingoshakerz releases Melancholia Trap\n- Recommendations for an amplifier channel MIDI Switcher please?\n- Viewing monitors connected to a Mac Studio before purchace.\n- Sound Magic DynamicX, drawing your own Dynamic response curves, now free downloading\n\n## Recently active forums\n\n- Recording: Gear + Techniques\n- Mixing | Mastering | Post Production\n- New Products + Industry News\n- Music Business\n- Mac Music\n- Windows Music\n- Apps | Other Computers/OS\n- Guitar Technology\n- Keyboards + Synthesizers\n- DIY Electronics + Studio Design\n- Live Sound | Performance\n- Music Theory | Songwriting | Composition\n- User Reviews\n- Remote Collaboration\n- Self-Promotion\n- Feedback\n- SOS Support Forum\n\n## Login\n\nYou may login with either your assigned username or your e-mail address.\n\nThe password field is case sensitive.\n\nCreate an account\n\n- Contact Us\n- Cookie Policy\n- Help\n- Privacy Policy\n- Terms of Use\n\nAll contents copyright © SOS Publications Group and/or its licensors, 1985-2025.

The story follows Beatrice Prior, who must choose her faction while grappling with her identity as a Divergent, a person who does not fit neatly into any one group.</PlotSummary>\n    <Themes>Dystopia, Identity, Choice, Fear, Maturity</Themes>\n    <IntensityLevel>High</IntensityLevel>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\nWith thumbprint data security and track counts in the thousands, the scoring process for <Name>Divergent</Name> was close to science fiction itself! Released on <ReleaseYear>March 21, 2014</ReleaseYear> in the US, it instantly became the highest-grossing movie of that month, ahead of 300: Rise Of An Empire. Both were scored by <Director>Junkie XL</Director>.\n\nA pseudonym for Dutchman Tom Holkenborg, <Director>Junkie XL</Director> is best known as an EDM musician and producer, who has six solo albums to his name. Holkenborg explains that his flurry of major Hollywood film scores is the result of a deliberate strategy on his part, starting with him moving to LA in 2002 to pursue a career in film music. \n\n\"I gradually got more and more deeply involved in the film-scoring world, and worked, for example, on the Matrix trilogy and the video game The Matrix: Path Of Neo. I also occasionally worked with Hans Zimmer and in 2009, when I began working with him more closely, he invited me to rent a space at his Remote Control facility.\"\n\nThe story in a nutshell is that the main character has to make a very difficult choice when she is 16 as to what group she is going to join. The test she takes to help her decide is inconclusive, and means that she's a <Name>Divergent</Name>, and is at risk of being killed, because divergents are seen as a danger in this society. \n\nThe music needed to reflect this. Most movies have more of a third-person perspective, and this means that the music is constantly commenting on the things you see on the screen. For example, the moment the bad guy appears, you have some scary music. But when a movie is shot from a first-person perspective, the music should reflect the responses of that person to what she experiences.\n\nAccording to Holkenborg, once he has decided on the general approach of the score, his next step is sound design. This he mostly does in Kyma, which is \"basically an extremely complicated version of Reaktor.\" \n\nAs with many movies these days, particularly those aimed at a youth market, <Name>Divergent</Name> features a number of pop songs, in this case specifically written for the movie. They feature the likes of Ellie Goulding, Pia Mia, Snow Patrol, Tame Impala, M83, Skrillex, and others.\n\nMeyerson conducted his final scoring mix for <Name>Divergent</Name> at Remote Control Studio A, using a Euphonix System 5, his favorite ATC monitors, and three Pro Tools rigs. \n\n\"Every movie has a different sound and approach, and like with every other movie, I began by taking some time to think about what I wanted to do with <Name>Divergent</Name>, not necessarily musically, but conceptually.\"\n\nIn conclusion, <Name>Divergent</Name> is a film that combines thrilling elements with a deep exploration of identity and choice, set against a backdrop of a dystopian future, making it a compelling watch for fans of the genre.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly highlighting the relevant information using the specified XML tags.",

                "Plot Summary": "In a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the kind), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The remaining population, the Factionless, holds no status or privilege. Upon turning sixteen, children undergo a serum-induced psychological aptitude test that reveals their best-suited faction, although they can choose any faction as their permanent group during the subsequent Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice Prior lives in Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew, and Abnegation's leader, Marcus Eaton, serve on the ruling council. When Beatrice was tested, her results show equal attributes of multiple factions: Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless, making her a Divergent. Her proctor Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation. She warns her to conceal her accurate results because Divergents can think independently and would threaten the existing social order. The next day, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite at the Choosing Ceremony, while she selects Dauntless. She meets Christina, Al, and Will, other faction transfers. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. A harsh Dauntless leader, Eric Colter, warns the initiates that those who fail to meet the faction's high standards will become Factionless. Beatrice jumps from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net and gaining respect from Four, a transferred instructor. Beatrice initially struggles in Dauntless training and ranks far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help, she slowly improves. Eric then matches her against her nemesis, Candor transfer Peter Hayes, in a fight that ends with Beatrice's defeat and recovery in the infirmary. Unwilling to miss the crucial Capture the Flag test, she leaves the infirmary, joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut. In the next training phase, the initiates confront their deepest fears in psychological simulations. Beatrice's divergence enables her to creatively navigate the tests, but Four cautions her to conceal her abilities and approach the challenges like a typical Dauntless would. Beatrice visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her, but Four rescues her. Al begs Tris to forgive him the next day, but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into 'The Pit'. Four takes Beatrice into his fear simulations to prepare her for the final test. There, she learns that he is Tobias Eaton and that his father, Marcus, used to beat him as a child. Beatrice then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The Dauntless recruits are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for mind control. The next day, the Dauntless prepares to attack Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who is also Divergent. When the Dauntless raids Abnegation, they split from their group to find Beatrice's parents. However, Eric captures Four, realizing he isn’t under control, and orders Beatrice's execution. Her mother, Natalie, a former Dauntless, saves her but is later shot and killed during their escape. Tris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, so Beatrice goes in alone to find Four, who is now under mind control designed for Divergents. Knowing Four's fears, Beatrice manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader, Jeanine Matthews, has Dauntless execute nearly the entire Abnegation faction. Beatrice uses a sample of the mind control serum on herself to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.",

Read our extensive list of rules for more information on other types of posts like fan-art and self-promotion, or message the moderators if you have any questions.\n\n# Prometheus - Everything explained and analysed *SPOILERS*\n\nThis post goes way in depth to Prometheus and explains some of the deeper themes of the film as well as some stuff I completely overlooked while watching the film.\n\nNOTE: I did NOT write this post, I just found it on the web.\n\nLink: http://cavalorn.livejournal.com/584135.html#cutid1\n\nPrometheus contains such a huge amount of mythic resonance that it effectively obscures a more conventional plot. I'd like to draw your attention to the use of motifs and callbacks in the film that not only enrich it, but offer possible hints as to what was going on in otherwise confusing scenes.\n\nLet's begin with the eponymous titan himself, Prometheus. He was a wise and benevolent entity who created mankind in the first place, forming the first humans from clay. The Gods were more or less okay with that, until Prometheus gave them fire. This was a big no-no, as fire was supposed to be the exclusive property of the Gods. As punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock and condemned to have his liver ripped out and eaten every day by an eagle. (His liver magically grew back, in case you were wondering.)\n\nFix that image in your mind, please: the giver of life, with his abdomen torn open. We'll be coming back to it many times in the course of this article.\n\nThe ethos of the titan Prometheus is one of willing and necessary sacrifice for life's sake. That's a pattern we see replicated throughout the ancient world. J G Frazer wrote his lengthy anthropological study, The Golden Bough, around the idea of the Dying God - a lifegiver who voluntarily dies for the sake of the people. It was incumbent upon the King to die at the right and proper time, because that was what heaven demanded, and fertility would not ensue if he did not do his royal duty of dying.\n\nNow, consider the opening sequence of Prometheus. We fly over a spectacular vista, which may or may not be primordial Earth. According to Ridley Scott, it doesn't matter. A lone Engineer at the top of a waterfall goes through a strange ritual, drinking from a cup of black goo that causes his body to disintegrate into the building blocks of life. We see the fragments of his body falling into the river, twirling and spiralling into DNA helices.\n\nRidley Scott has this to say about the scene: 'That could be a planet anywhere. All he’s doing is acting as a gardener in space. And the plant life, in fact, is the disintegration of himself. If you parallel that idea with other sacrificial elements in history – which are clearly illustrated with the Mayans and the Incas – he would live for one year as a prince, and at the end of that year, he would be taken and donated to the gods in hopes of improving what might happen next year, be it with crops or weather, etcetera.'\n\nCan we find a God in human history who creates plant life through his own death, and who is associated with a river? It's not difficult to find several, but the most obvious candidate is Osiris, the epitome of all the Frazerian 'Dying Gods'.\n\nAnd we wouldn't be amiss in seeing the first of the movie's many Christian allegories in this scene, either. The Engineer removes his cloak before the ceremony, and hesitates before drinking the cupful of genetic solvent; he may well have been thinking 'If it be Thy will, let this cup pass from me.'\n\nSo, we know something about the Engineers, a founding principle laid down in the very first scene: acceptance of death, up to and including self-sacrifice, is right and proper in the creation of life. Prometheus, Osiris, John Barleycorn, and of course the Jesus of Christianity are all supposed to embody this same principle. It is held up as one of the most enduring human concepts of what it means to be 'good'.\n\nSeen in this light, the perplexing obscurity of the rest of the film yields to an examination of the interwoven themes of sacrifice, creation, and preservation of life. We also discover, through hints, exactly what the nature of the clash between the Engineers and humanity entailed.\n\nThe crew of the Prometheus discover an ancient chamber, presided over by a brooding solemn face, in which urns of the same black substance are kept. A mural on the wall presents an image which, if you did as I asked earlier on, you will recognise instantly: the lifegiver with his abdomen torn open. Go and look at it here to refresh your memory. Note the serenity on the Engineer's face here.\n\nAnd there's another mural there, one which shows a familiar xenomorph-like figure. This is the Destroyer who mirrors the Creator, I think - the avatar of supremely selfish life, devouring and destroying others purely to preserve itself. As Ash puts it: 'a survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality.'\n\nThrough Shaw and Holloway's investigations, we learn that the Engineers not only created human life, they supervised our development. (How else are we to explain the numerous images of Engineers in primitive art, complete with star diagram showing us the way to find them?) We have to assume, then, that for a good few hundred thousand years, they were pretty happy with us. They could have destroyed us at any time, but instead, they effectively invited us over; the big pointy finger seems to be saying 'Hey, guys, when you're grown up enough to develop space travel, come see us.' Until something changed, something which not only messed up our relationship with them but caused their installation on LV-223 to be almost entirely wiped out.\n\nFrom the Engineers' perspective, so long as humans retained that notion of self-sacrifice as central, we weren't entirely beyond redemption. But we went and screwed it all up, and the film hints at when, if not why: the Engineers at the base died two thousand years ago. That suggests that the event that turned them against us and led to the huge piles of dead Engineers lying about was one and the same event. We did something very, very bad, and somehow the consequences of that dreadful act accompanied the Engineers back to LV-223 and massacred them.\n\nIf you have uneasy suspicions about what 'a bad thing approximately 2,000 years ago' might be, then let me reassure you that you are right. An astonishing excerpt from the Movies.com interview with Ridley Scott:\n\nMovies.com: We had heard it was scripted that the Engineers were targeting our planet for destruction because we had crucified one of their representatives, and that Jesus Christ might have been an alien. Was that ever considered?\n\nRidley Scott: We definitely did, and then we thought it was a little too on the nose. But if you look at it as an “our children are misbehaving down there” scenario, there are moments where it looks like we’ve gone out of control, running around with armor and skirts, which of course would be the Roman Empire. And they were given a long run. A thousand years before their disintegration actually started to happen. And you can say, \"Let's send down one more of our emissaries to see if he can stop it.\" Guess what? They crucified him.\n\nYeah. The reason the Engineers don't like us any more is that they made us a Space Jesus, and we broke him. Reader, that's not me pulling wild ideas out of my arse. That's RIDLEY SCOTT.\n\nSo, imagine poor crucified Jesus, a fresh spear wound in his side. Oh, hey, there's the 'lifegiver with his abdomen torn open' motif again. That's three times now: Prometheus, Engineer mural, Jesus Christ. And I don't think I have to mention the 'sacrifice in the interest of giving life' bit again, do I? Everyone on the same page? Good.\n\nSo how did our (in the context of the film) terrible murderous act of crucifixion end up wiping out all but one of the Engineers back on LV-223? Presumably through the black slime, which evidently models its behaviour on the user's mental state. Create unselfishly, accepting self-destruction as the cost, and the black stuff engenders fertile life. But expose the potent black slimy stuff to the thoughts and emotions of flawed humanity, and 'the sleep of reason produces monsters'. We never see the threat that the Engineers were fleeing from, we never see them killed other than accidentally (decapitation by door), and we see no remaining trace of whatever killed them. Either it left a long time ago, or it reverted to inert black slime, waiting for a human mind to reactivate it.\n\nThe black slime reacts to the nature and intent of the being that wields it, and the humans in the film didn't even know that they WERE wielding it. That's why it remained completely inert in David's presence, and why he needed a human proxy in order to use the stuff to create anything. The black goo could read no emotion or intent from him, because he was an android.\n\nShaw's comment when the urn chamber is entered - 'we've changed the atmosphere in the room' - is deceptively informative. The psychic atmosphere has changed, because humans - tainted, Space Jesus-killing humans - are present. The slime begins to engender new life, drawing not from a self-sacrificing Engineer but from human hunger for knowledge, for more life, for more everything. Little wonder, then, that it takes serpent-like form. The symbolism of a corrupting serpent, turning men into beasts, is pretty unmistakeable.\n\nRefusal to accept death is anathema to the Engineers. Right from the first scene, we learned their code of willing self-sacrifice in accord with a greater purpose. When the severed Engineer head is temporarily brought back to life, its expression registers horror and disgust. Cinemagoers are confused when the head explodes, because it's not clear why it should have done so. Perhaps the Engineer wanted to die again, to undo the tainted human agenda of new life without sacrifice.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of June 9, 2012\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of June 2012\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2012\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was surreal, because they would bus you in in the middle of the night, so you couldn't see any of the country. They would just drop you in this resort compound, which was in fact surrounded by a razor-wire fence. You couldn't leave, much like in the film, and there was a kind of fake town where you could go shopping. The Chinese restaurant and the horrible discotheque in the movie are both based on that actual resort; the scene with the man on the ATV on the beach being chased by guards actually happened. And then, at the end of the week, they bused you back during the day, and you could see the actual immediate surrounding country, which was very poverty-stricken. There were people living in shacks. That contrast was obviously horrible, but also surreal, because you realized you had never actually entered the country; you were just dropped into this strange pocket of a sort of alternate dimension that had just grown up to become this tacky Disneyland mirror image of reality.\"\n\n- GoofsIn the last bus scene, James' hands are clearly in view and uninjured when the right one should be cut, bruised, or at least bandaged.\n\n- QuotesEm Foster: You're so frozen these days I can't even tell if you're sleeping or awake.\n\n- Alternate versionsThere were two, slightly different versions released, an R-rated cut for the U.S. market, and an Unrated (previously, NC-17) one for the rest of the world and the home video market on Blu-Ray. Time differences are negligible; the differences are, as usual in cases such as these, that the Unrated cut contains slightly more violence and nudity. A detailed breakdown of the differences can be found at movie-censorship.com\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Amanda the Jedi Show: INFINITY POOL Mia Goth is DISTURBING | Unrated Cut Explained (2023)\n\n- SoundtracksCharles Serenade\nPerformed by Jim Williams\nWritten by Jim Williams\nCourtesy of Bucks Music Group Limited\n\n### User reviews489\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Dive in if you dare\n\nThis is a great film to get lost in, and experience the story and it's main character, Skarsgard. I do love original films, and early in the piece, it was so cool, not knowing where the film was going, but later on, in the last 40 minutes, we have moments of predicability. I found this a fun shock movie, where we have some scenes. Which are truly memorably bizarre, the final one, a scene of normality, staying in my mind the most. This is one of these films, that lingers in the memory, days after you see it. It has strobing. 180 degree turn shots, a daunting music score, cloning, and sexy Mia Goth, really playing her part to the hilt. One X rated sex shot we could of done without. Brandon Cronenberg (David's) has definitely created something originally appealing and engrossing, but it gets too ludiicrous and crazy in it's second half. Some of the bloodletting scenes, are pretty heavy. Definitely recommended, but be warned.\n\n- videorama-759-859391\n- Jun 12, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ20\n\n- How long is Infinity Pool?Powered by Alexa\n- What is the meaning of the title?\n- What is the significance of the clone ritual?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 11, 2023 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - Canada\n    - Croatia\n    - Hungary\n    - United States\n    - France\n- Official sites\n    - Neon (United States)\n    - Official site\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Muerte infinita\n- Filming locations\n    - Sibenik, Croatia(resort)\n- Production companies\n    - Film Forge\n    - Hero Squared\n    - 4 Film\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $5,078,400\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $2,514,364\n    - Jan 29, 2023\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $5,202,301\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 57 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.78 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Infinity Pool (2023) in France?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was done on purpose, as director Eubanks felt the addition of \"old tech\" works as a possible misdirect.\n\n- GoofsWhen Nic is pulling Haley with his wheelchair in the corridors, as he turns the corner, her bed gets stuck. You can see the foot of a crew person who must've been pushing the bed and making sure it got stuck.\n\n- QuotesNic: The truth of the matter? What is the truth of the matter here? The only thing I know for certain is that you don't know what you're dealing with. You will be pulled from this shitty little shack you call a research facility so fast that the only thing relevant to be shown for any of this is the way it's all exposed, wrecked, and forgotten. You have *no* idea! You have no clue! Do you? Have any clue how fast dumb, lost little kids like me, Jonah, or Nomad could ruin a place like this? Have it come grinding to a halt like the stone wheel it is? You're clueless law in the Wild West, Damon. You're a relic protecting ruins. You're pathetic! The truth of the matter is that I'm the only one that has any sense around here.\n\n- ConnectionsReferenced in Film Junk Podcast: Episode 749: Underwater + Twilight Zone: The Movie + F/X (2020)\n\n- SoundtracksLa villa dei delitti\nPerformed by Gabriele Bazzi Berneri\nWritten by Gabriele Bazzi Berneri\nCourtesy of Crucial Music Corporation\n\n### User reviews330\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Better than the reviews you read on this site\n\nThe 'movie-snob' reviews almost kept me from watching this movie -- I'm glad I didn't listen to them. This was one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen in a long time. At one point I paused the movie to check outside because I thought I heard something -- the movie had me spooked and it takes a lot to get that kind of reaction out of me. There was an eerie feel that stayed with me through the entire movie and it had me guessing the entire time. \n\nThe movie could have been better -- there is an attempt to show some spiritual triumph for the main character and a love story that doesn't work, but the suspense and sci-fi elements alone make the movie a solid B and worth seeing.\n\n- craiginhouston\n- Oct 9, 2014\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ21\n\n- How long is The Signal?Powered by Alexa\n- What is 'The Signal' about?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - July 10, 2014 (Germany)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site (Japan)\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Señal Enigmatica\n- Filming locations\n    - New Mexico, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Automatik Entertainment\n    - Low Spark Films\n    - Nova Media\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $4,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $600,896\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $155,642\n    - Jun 15, 2014\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $2,595,622\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 37 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Hindi language plot outline for The Signal (2014)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Peele's first feature film, \"Get Out,\" was a critically acclaimed blockbuster, recognized with four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The film would earn Peele the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. His second feature, \"Us,\" broke numerous box-office records, becoming the biggest opening for an R-rated original film in history when released in March of 2019 to widespread critical praise. Peele's third feature, the original horror epic, \"Nope,\" opened in the summer of 2022 to rave reviews, the No. 1 slot at the box office, and once again becoming a widely discussed cultural phenomenon. Five years in the making, Peele produced and co-wrote Henry Selick's stop-motion animated feature, \"Wendell &amp; Wild,\" to which he also lent his voice as one of the title characters. Under the Monkeypaw banner, Peele co-wrote and produced Nia DaCosta's \"Candyman\" which made history as the first film helmed by a Black woman director to open at No. 1 at the box office. He also produced Spike Lee's \"BlacKkKlansman,\" which earned a nomination for Best Picture and won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. He has also served as executive producer for numerous television series, including \"Hunters\" (Amazon), \"Lovecraft Country\" (HBO), and \"The Twilight Zone\" (CBS). Prior to becoming a filmmaker, Peele was a celebrated comedian who was the co-star and co-creator of \"Key &amp; Peele\" on Comedy Central.\n\n- More at IMDbPro\n    - Contact info\n    - Agent info\n    - Resume\n\nView contact info at IMDbPro\n\n- Won 1 Oscar\n    - 109 wins &amp;amp;amp; 156 nominations total\n\n### Photos387\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ 381\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Known for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMovie\n\n- Director(directed by)\n\n- 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMovie\n\n- Director\n\n- 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMovie\n\n- Director\n\n- 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMovie\n\n- Writer\n\n- 2022\n\n### Credits\n\n### Director\n\n- Upcoming\n- 1\n\n- Untitled Fourth Film Directed by Jordan Peele\n    - Director\n    - Pre-production\n    - 2026\n\n- Previous\n- 4\n\n- Nope 6.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - Director (directed by)\n    - 2022\n- Us 6.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - Director\n    - 2019\n- Get Out 7.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - Director\n    - 2017\n- Battlestar Ga-FRAK-tica 4.5 Video\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - Director\n    - 2011\n\n### Writer\n\n- Upcoming\n- 2\n\n- Untitled Fourth Film Directed by Jordan Peele\n    - written by\n    - Pre-production\n    - 2026\n- OD\n    - Writer\n    - Post-production\n    - Video Game\n\n- Previous\n- 16\n\n- Wendell &amp;amp; Wild 6.4\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - screenplay by\n    - 2022\n- Nope 6.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - written by\n    - 2022\n- The Last O.G. 7.0 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - created by\n    - written by (creator)\n    - 2018–2021\n    - 40 episodes\n- Candyman 5.9\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - screenplay by\n    - 2021\n- The Twilight Zone 6.0 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - developed by\n    - written by\n    - story by (creator)\n    - 2019–2020\n    - 20 episodes\n- Us 6.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - written by\n    - 2019\n- Weird City 6.0 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - created by\n    - written by (creator)\n    - 2019\n    - 6 episodes\n- Get Out 7.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - written by\n    - 2017\n- Keanu 6.2\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - written by\n    - 2016\n- Key and Peele 8.3 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - creator\n    - written by\n    - created by\n    - 2012–2015\n    - 55 episodes\n- Rubberhead 3.6 TV Movie\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - Writer (segment \"Absorption\")\n    - 2014\n- Epic Rap Battles of History 8.1 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - written by\n    - 2013\n    - 1 episode\n- Laugh Factory 5.7 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - Writer\n    - 2010\n    - 1 episode\n- Alligator Boots 3.8 TV Movie\n    - Writer\n    - 2009\n- Obama 3.8 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - creator\n    - 2008–2010\n\n### Producer\n\n- Upcoming\n- 3\n\n- Him\n    - producer\n    - Post-production\n    - 2025\n- Untitled Fourth Film Directed by Jordan Peele\n    - producer (produced by)\n    - Pre-production\n    - 2026\n- The People Under the Stairs\n    - producer\n    - Pre-production\n\n- Previous\n- 22\n\n- Scare Tactics 4.7 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - executive producer\n    - 2024\n    - 10 episodes\n- Monkey Man 6.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - producer (produced by)\n    - 2024\n- Hunters 7.2 TV Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - executive producer\n    - 2020–2023\n    - 19 episodes\n- Quiet Part Loud 7.7 Podcast Series\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - executive producer\n    - 2022\n    - 13 episodes\n- Wendell &amp;amp; Wild 6.4\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - producer (p.g.a.)\n    - 2022\n- Nope 6.8\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - producer (produced by)\n    - 2022\n- Moshari 7.4 Short\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n    - executive producer\n    - 2022\n- Honk for Jesus.

Heart breaking, but it's impossible to have a good movie with such a poor script, no matter how good the other elements are. I won't give more details to avoid spoilers. I cannot even talk much about the acting, since the characters are so much stereotyped. It would be unfair to blame the actors, they did what their roles required, which wasn't much.\n\nHaving said that, it has some entretainment value, but better seen in a theater because of the visuals.\n\nI am sure Korean cinema could do better on the writing side, having so many good ones in the last years.\n\n- cbrites\n- Sep 8, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### What kind of astronaut is this?\n\nI want to comment on the character of the main role as an astronaut. I think he is an astronaut who is not very smart and intelligent, and I don't see any professionalism in him in dealing with any incidents that might occur. I saw him as an astronaut who had just been trained yesterday. In my view, an astronaut will be quick to make brilliant decisions when faced with a situation or incident that shows his professionalism, but in this film the astronaut is not alert and actually thinks too late. Yes, even though I know this is a fiction film, not everything that happens in the film should have no logic. Throughout the film, the astronaut is not shown eating or drinking anything while on the moon to maintain his consciousness and health.\n\n- ramseygiancarlo\n- Sep 27, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Super Fun Sci-Fi Drame\n\nIf you are looking for a a scientifically sound film based upon the principles of modern space travel and exploration this is not the film for you. If you are looking for a super fun, sci-fi adventure with dramatic undertones this is for you. The Korean space agency is looking to land a man on the moon, and redeem its prior lethal and failed mission in this futuristic adventure. Circumstances have a lone young astronaut stranded and the film involves the attempts to rescue him. The characters are engaging. The story is fun. The effects are visually exciting to behold. This is just a fun time from great Korean filmmakers.\n\n- tkdlifemagazine\n- Feb 1, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Not bad but not great either\n\n- ProstheticPrincess\n- Sep 16, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### 1-2 stars are just as bad as 9-10. Decent effects wasted on dumb drama.\n\nFirst, I'm suspect of those abject stars on here. Both either didn't watch the movie or are bots.\n\nThe acting is a little above mediocre. The action manages to keep your attention. The effects are pretty decent. Not much to complain about besides the drama tacked on to stretch a runtime and give more screentime to a Korean idol. That created the occasional cringe moment. It doesn't ruin the plot or story though. Just something American audiences aren't familiar with so they don't understand this mugging they do in Korean AAA movies.\n\nThis really needed a big screen viewing to completely grasp the scope of the movie. I felt like I was loosing part of the visuals on television and this movie relies on them.\n\nOverall, an average movie but above average fo Korean Cinema. It's a popcorn fodder sci-fi beast so that doesn't matter that much.\n\n- Desdecardo78\n- Jan 31, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### \"The Moon?\"\n\nThe story revolves around Korea's second attempt at reaching the moon (in 2029) after a previous failed attempt.\n\nThis time, things don't go well either.. and one (incompetent?) man is left stranded and has to survive using the Moon resources until he is rescued. Solar flares, sudden meteor showers and many more can be expected. This is what Jay from RedLetterMedia would probably call \"disaster porn\".\n\nI expected more of this film due to the quality levels of production and visuals. And seeing SO many 9 and 10 score reviews from accounts that have not reviewed anything else says a lot about it.\n\nPersonally, I found it completely devoid of charm, personality and lacking in engagement. Sure, lots of \"things\" happen and tension is almost always high (as with all space missions), but the slow pacing and dull developments make the 2-hour runtime almost a chore. Barely anyone stands out and there's no one to latch on to. Doesn't help that there's a lot of \"Government involvement\" that interferes as an extra layer of tedium, and the interpersonal interactions are very generic.\n\nIt's okay if you like space movies, but I was really bored the entire time.\n\n- daisukereds\n- Oct 21, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Not only Sci-fi also Humanity\n\nIf you still believe in humanity you will find this movie is interesting and touching. You can see the younger generation can sacrifice for their nation and future. I gain strength and courage from this movie. Plus all the actors/actress are really did the good job. And also director Kim Yong Hwa nim , who plant a seed of sci-fi movie inside me. I always thought sci-fi are boring thanks to Director nim I enjoyed it. I have no idea why Korean hate sci-fi and this movie. If I were them I will clapping for that kind of domestic movie improvement. Sci-fi with Humanity. Must try in cinema 4DX is best..\n\n- khingthazinthant\n- Aug 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Good But Could Have Been Better\n\nAs an American and a huge fan of Hollywood action films, it would take a lot for me to rate this a ten. Armageddon(1998) and Apollo 13 (1995), this is not. However, the potential is there but doesn't become realized until the 2nd third of the movie. It becomes more intense. You begin to care about the characters. The final 3rd hammers it home and you're not so concerned about its start anymore. The action, the acting, and the suspense are great. You're on the edge of your seat. You cry. You cheer. Once you finish the movie, however, you become upset about the weak use of dynamic Korean actors like Kim Rae-won, Lee Yi-kyung, and Lee Sung-min. Then you wonder why the beginning was just so so. Budget issues? Perhaps. Even though Do Kyungsoo is the star, making others have a stronger presence would not take away from the star. No one took from Bruce Willis' spotlight, but the entire cast of characters in Armageddon shone brightly because it was so well-written. Finally, the music score needed a little work. Ijs.\n\n- quittech\n- Aug 31, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Best Korean Movie of 2023?! 💯\n\nHello. I'm a casual enjoyer of Korean Movies since 2015 👋🏻\n\nThis month, i got a chance to watch The Moon exclusively on fans screening in Indonesia, August 5th.\n\nFor me this movie is beyond my expectation. The cinematography is excellent. The CG of spaceships, moon, and blank space is wayy much better than other Korean Movies that has kind of same genre of natural disasters.\n\nMain Actor, Doh Kyungsoo played his role in a brilliant way. He can switch emotions in such a brief second and whole performance like walking in the moon is soo realistic. I'm quite surprised that he was debuted as an Idol, not an actor in 2012. As far as I know, in Korea there's a stereotype that Idol-Actor will never be as good as debuted actors since the start. However, Doh-nim surely breaks that stereotype and showing his full potential in this movie as an Acting Genius Idol-Actor.\n\nThe director, Kim Yong Hwa, is very considerate by showing the backstory of all main characters, makin us relates and understand more. All the drama until the nerve-wracking scene makes enjoy and happy seeing this wonderful movie. However, this movie has some unrealistic realisation of space, but still not making this movie less enjoyable as I keep in mind \"this is fictional\"\n\nOverall The Moon deserved a bunch of attention. Especially those of you guys who likes the story about space and movie with great amount of tension. I recommend you to watch this with friends or date on 4DX or IMAX for better experience\n\nI found it quite funny how the crowd on the studio holding hands with their partner on the kind like \"fast and furious\" scene.\n\n- hikaripashya\n- Aug 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### My First Korean Movie in 2023\n\nI rarely watch movie in cinema. Unless the cast of the movie or the storyline do attract me, then I will only choose to enjoy the movie in cinema. Well, The Moon meet my requirements obviously. I shed tears a lot because of Hwang Sun Woo, played by Doh Kyung Soo. Even at the risk of his life, he did not forget his mission as an astronaut. All the audience was impressed by his excellent performance. Good job, Doh Kyung Soo! To all the other actors and actresses and also the crews of The Moon, you are all amazing. Thank you for bringing such a good movie to the audience all over the world. Well done!\n\n- pandalee-25119\n- Aug 13, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Cringworthy and embarassing\n\nTrain to Busan, Flu are two very good Korean movies. There are plenty of good Korean movies out there. This one is not one. It can not be taken seriously. The story is highly flawed. The lead actor was simply not qualified for the role. He was suited for a romance melodrama. The lead Role also was highly flawed. An army Seal and Astronaut panicking crying losing control etc...\nNo one in Korea Space agency seemed to have the right character to manage any emergency. To make it more embarrassing right at the beginning they are begging NASA for help. Have some self reliance national pride and dignity! Every major news event had to be repeated in English to be given credibility and importance. It seems unless the event is repeated in US news is not worthy.\n\nThe acting is bad plot is well unwatchable, special effect is good if you forget laws of physics.\n\n- ramkoil\n- Sep 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Sustains the drama so well!\n\nKorean movies are renowned for their drama, the anxiety, and the tangibility of the circumstances they so effortlessly concoct, and Kim Yong-hwa's \"The Moon\" is no exception. It inherited all the merits and signatures of a customary Korean production: great technicalities and an even greater understanding of persuasive screenwriting.\n\nThe tension tends to be palpable; the inherent drama and the emotional core help to suspend our disbelief and make us involved with the proceedings onboard.\n\nThe only thing that may affect some segments of the audience is that it is too technical, too jargon-heavy, and that might mar the quotient of entertainment.\n\n- SoumikBanerjee1996\n- Sep 15, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### I loved it and that's my personal opnion\n\n- another0908name\n- Sep 22, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### The First Sci-Fi Movie I Ever Watch!\n\nThis is such a great movie! The CGI is very solid to the point I think it was recorded on the real moon😭 What I love about this movie is that I don't got to feel very tense throughout the movie, there is little laughter during the movie. I can't enjoy a movie if it uneasy to watch. But still it was suffocating to see the astronaut struggling alone in the moon far away. It is sending me a second-hand depression to watch the astronaut throwed away here and there inside his rocket😭\nBut that is what makes this movie good, it could bring me in to the situation.\n\nThank you to my bestie who invited me to watch this movie with her! Best unforgettable moment ever!\n\n- nurulanindytaaa\n- Aug 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### The Martian in Korea\n\n- ryanmo-35178\n- Oct 24, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### THE CGI IS AMAZING\n\nI really enjoy watching Along With The Gods and when i know the director made another movie im so excited!! I barely watched SF movies but The Moon is better than i've had imagine, the characters, the plotline, the CGI just too powerfull, its so heartwarming story and i cried, the way Sunwoo's struggle as he tried so hard to survive to Kim Jae Guk and Yoon Moon whom creating intense tension, its just fit the portion, i feel the emotion the fear the desperate in Kyungsoo's eyes, its just worth it. Its one of the best director Kim Yonghwa ever made and im glad i could watch in IMAX and immersed in it.\n\n- twelvedecs\n- Aug 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Fly me to the moon\n\nBefore I go on and completely contradicting my no pun intended saying I use with my reviews, I have to make a pun in German: \"Erstens kommt es anders und zweitens als Mond denkt\"! Firstly, it turns out differently and secondly, than you think - is the literal translation. Though I changed \"you\" into moon (man/mond). Just in case you even care.\n\nThe thing is, there is not much to say here. You could say this is the Korean version of Armageddon - though it has been quite a few years since I saw it. And obviously it is not the same story wise. It has also elements of Gravity and other movies in it. But it also has a high amount of Melodrama ... so much so, that you might have issues with the movie. Even thinking that it is funny - not intended.\n\nThe acting is ok, but the script gives them quite a few challenges. What does work, even if you do not like ... much else, are the visuals. And if you were a fan of Armageddon you should have a field day with this ... a moon field day (do they have fields there? Well you know what I mean).\n\n- kosmasp\n- Sep 24, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### A Good Space Movie with Over Dramatic Screenplay\n\nPositives:\n\nThis movie deserves credit for its technical approach to the space science fiction genre, reminiscent of films like Gravity. It explores the complexities of spacecraft launches and lunar landings, albeit in a simplified and audience-friendly manner. The VFX and CGI are top-notch, successfully creating a visually immersive experience. These high production values ensure the film connects with a broader audience, even those not deeply familiar with space technology.\n\nThe imaginative depiction of futuristic space advancements-such as drones, live video broadcasts, and lunar gateways-is both fascinating and ambitious. While the technology showcased is far from reality, the speculative vision is commendable and could inspire upcoming innovations in space exploration.\n\nNegatives:\n\nHowever, the movie stumbles due to its overly dramatic screenplay. The plot is predictable, offering hints early on that \"everything is going to be fine in the end.\" This lack of suspense undermines the tension and emotional investment that are critical for a gripping sci-fi narrative.\n\nThe film's pacing is another drawback. It moves too quickly, without allowing for \"plot breaks\" or moments of reflection. The relentless storytelling leaves no room for viewers to immerse themselves in the narrative fully. The background score, while extraterrestrial and sonically pleasing, is overbearing and constant, leaving little breathing space for quieter, introspective scenes.\n\nThe emotional elements feel forced and formulaic, as the movie leans heavily on familiar tropes found in other space mission films. This approach detracts from the unique technical aspects and makes the story feel repetitive and uninspired.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThis film stands out as a good space sci-fi movie from Korean cinema, showcasing impressive visuals and imaginative concepts. However, its predictable narrative, rushed pacing, and overemphasis on drama prevent it from reaching the heights of genre-defining classics.\n\nWhile it is worth a watch for its technical brilliance and futuristic imagination, there is a longing for a more nuanced and original approach in future entries from this genre.\n\n- Gaurav\\_FilmFavor\n- Dec 31, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Maybe kids between the ages of 2 to 10 years approximate age group, might like this movie\n\n- Neptune165\n- Jan 12, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Cringeworthy story with few good effects\n\n- hoschi2k\n- Dec 27, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### The Best Sci-fic\n\nThis movie recomend for all age range. Very good CGI packaging and a background story that makes everyone curious. The flow is very neat and does not seem rushed. But the explanation of each character is very detailed and not excessive. There is no doubt about the quality of the actors. I really fell in love with the three main actors of this film. So talented. Doh Kyungsoo proved that he is a very talented actor. Critics say, Do Kyungsoo will have a long career as an actor. The other two actors are very capable and make this film very dramatic as well as of high quality. If there is a sequel, I'm wait for it!!! The Moon, BEST!!!\n\n- dkssayang\n- Aug 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### A pointless movie\n\nKorean movies have come a long way and have become a major force. I didn't consider watching Korean movies in the past, but during the past few years, I find myself watching more and more Korean movies. However, a movie like this is an embarrassment to the burgeoning Korean movie industry.\n\nThis movie fails in multiple dimensions. Most importantly, it is simply devoid of any meaningful story. It pretends to have a storyline. Indeed, it tells a lot of stories -- a young astronaut trying to realize his father's legacy, a failed scientist trying to redeem his failure, humanism that goes beyond national interest, etc. But, all the story elements are cliche at best and do not fit coherently at all. It is just a mess created by combining fragments of the stories from the past space disaster movies (e.g., Gravity, Martian, etc.).\n\nThe acting was truly horrible. Do Kyung Soo, who is supposed to be an ace UDT (the elitist special force in Korea), looks totally clueless and just screams during the entire movie. He is reminiscent of a B-level horror movie actress B, whose job is just screaming around until she dies. Seol Kyung Goo portrayed one of the most cliched character in the movie history, and it was just embarassing to watch Kim Hee Ae, especially when she was making a \"saving the Korean astronaut speech to the American astronauts\".\n\nThe special effects were mediocre at best, although I must acknowledge that the Korean movies have gone a long way to be where they are now (in a very short period of time). The series of events happened during the course of the movie were more or less random without amounting to anything.\n\nAll these amount to a movie that has no point. There is no story that we can immerse; the acting is too poor to be appreciated; the events are uninspiring and random. There was nothing I could salvage from this movie. This movie might offer some value to the fans of Do Kyung Soo, the protagonist, who used to be a member of a popular Korean idol group. Otherwise, you will do yourself a favor by skipping this movie.\n\n- mr-giroro\n- Jan 14, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### FUN! I really enjoy it.\n\nThe Moon is FUN (seriously fun!). I really enjoy it.\n\nIn terms of story, it feels simple but wrapped in extraordinary acting from each actor (esp. The main actors) &amp; the CG which is also very detailed makes me feel like i'm on the moon; i can feel the sensation of being in outer space.\n\nThe best part is i'm happy because i really enjoy it. This reason is enough to make me want to recommend watching this on the big screen. The feeling you get will be more 'wow' by watching it on the big screen, the sound (DoLBY ATMOS) is amazing. Because this is really fun (ofc with some touching moments). Love it sooo muucch!\n\nPS: special shout-out to Mr. Doh Kyungsoo! DAEBAK! You're soooooo DAEBAK :)\n\n- blackwhitelovers\n- Aug 7, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### The Moon, fails to launch\n\n\"The Moon\" attempts to soar into the depths of space drama but stumbles on its mission. Despite commendable visual effects that bring the vastness of space to life, the film falters in several crucial aspects. The narrative centers around a lone man stranded in space, juxtaposed with the struggles of an Earth-bound counterpart determined to rescue him.\n\nRegrettably, the writing fails to capture the gravity of the situation. The dialogue lacks depth and fails to evoke the necessary emotional connection, leaving the audience detached from the characters' plight. The poor choice of actors exacerbates this issue, as their performances fall short of conveying the intensity required for such a high-stakes scenario.\n\nMoreover, the movie neglects to portray the professionalism inherent in space travel. Instead of showcasing a competent team working cohesively, it narrows its focus to a single man, disregarding the collaborative nature of space missions. This oversight undermines the film's credibility and authenticity.\n\nOne glaring flaw is the undue emphasis on glorifying Korea, distracting from the core narrative. While celebrating national pride is understandable, it becomes a distraction when it eclipses the primary plot. The film's myopic lens on one individual overshadows the collective effort often associated with space exploration.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Moon\" may shine visually, but its shortcomings in writing, actor selection, and thematic focus result in a lackluster cinematic experience. The failure to depict the intricacies of space missions and the distracting emphasis on nationalism hinder the film's overall impact. A score of 2/10 reflects the film's inability to transcend its aesthetic appeal and deliver a compelling and cohesive narrative.\n\n- devilkazuma-78349\n- Jan 12, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Prepare handkerchiefs, you will have to cry a lot.😭😭😭\n\nA captivating drama awaits you, where tears will be shed throughout the entire movie. The story revolves around personal struggles, with almost every character experiencing their own emotional turmoil. However, be prepared for some characters who indulge in \"crocodile tears\" to provoke the viewers' emotions. This movie is not merely a film, but rather resembles a Korean funeral, where sorrowful cries resonate. After an hour of intense emotional rollercoaster, it is advisable to shield impressionable children from the screens, as their faces might be stained with tears for the entire week. However, like everything in life, moderation is key. While the cinematography is praiseworthy with skilled cameramen expertly maneuvering the camera to capture essential and even unessential moments, there were instances where their efforts became rather irritating.\n\n- Democrit\n- Sep 20, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### More from this title\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After Anderton sees that it's him in the prevision, he sets the alarm on his watch for 35 hours and 56 minutes. Counting backwards from 3:06pm this means that it is currently just after 3am when Anderton, Jad, Wally and the rest of PreCrime are at work. Also, when Anderton tries to escape on the MagLev and calls Lamar in his office, it is obviously in broad daylight and not 3am.\n\n- QuotesJohn Anderton: Why'd you catch that?Danny Witwer: Because it was going to fall.John Anderton: You're certain?Danny Witwer: Yeah.John Anderton: But it didn't fall.

Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.\n\nIn the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.\n\nI will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story.

One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time.\n\nJohn Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where \"man has no past... and humanity has no future\".\n\nDark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for \"original screenplay\" or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie \"noir\" like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).\n\nI gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.\n\nThe visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.\n\nProyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.\n\nI'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.\n\nTrevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but \"Memories of Shell Beach\" is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.\n\nAltogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality.\n\n- nitehawk-8\n- Jun 14, 1999\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ9\n\n- Is 'Dark City' based on a book?\n- What Roman mythological elements are found in the film?\n- How do I solve the \"To Shell Beach...\" game on the DVD?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 6, 1998 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - Australia\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Facebook\n    - WarnerBros.com\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Ciudad en tinieblas\n- Filming locations\n    - Museum Underground Station, Hyde Park, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n- Production companies\n    - Mystery Clock Cinema\n    - New Line Cinema\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $27,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $14,378,331\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $5,576,953\n    - Mar 1, 1998\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $27,201,335\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 40 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - SDDS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat was the official certification given to Dark City (1998) in Japan?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The production was given unprecedented permission to shut down Times Square for one Sunday. At the time, the news ticker was providing updates on the George W. Bush-Al Gore election. To avoid dating the film, Crowe got permission to change the NASDAQ sign in post-production.\n\n- GoofsWhen David and Brian are in the car in the beginning you can clearly see that they are about one or two feet higher compared to the other cars, even though they are in the relatively low Mustang, revealing that the car is probably on a trailer rather than on the road.\n\n- QuotesSofía: Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.\n\n- Crazy creditsThere are no opening credits for the film.\n\n- Alternate versionsThe 2015 Blu-Ray release includes an alternate ending version with a vastly expanded ending.

And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you won't be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.\n\n- monk\\_venkman\n- Mar 23, 2004\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ20\n\n- How long is Vanilla Sky?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - December 20, 2001 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Spain\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Spanish\n- Also known as\n    - Khung Trời Ảo Mộng\n- Filming locations\n    - Bar Building - 44th Street between 5th &amp;amp;amp; 6th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Paramount Pictures\n    - Cruise/Wagner Productions\n    - Vinyl Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $68,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $100,618,344\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $25,015,518\n    - Dec 16, 2001\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $203,388,341\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 16 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Undoubtedly the best of the franchise too. Set in a world invaded by alien life forms, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) And Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) are held captive by Howard (John Goodman) a man infatuated with doomsday preparations. They are held in an underground bunker installed with all necessities to sustain basic human life. However along the way they grow increasingly suspicious about Howard’s secretive past and plot a risky plan that may put their lives in danger.\n\n10 Cloverfield lane is a Sci-Fi thriller that will have you on edge from start to finish and will leave you wanting more when the 1 hour 40 minute runtime has finished. This leads me into my only criticism of the film after which I shall get into the plethora of things that makes 10 Cloverfield Lane not only an amazing film but J.J Abrams magnum opus. My one gripe the ending of the film, the film ends on a rather ambiguous note which is not a bad thing, however I was left wanting more, why and who is doing this to the planet. This could have been easily changed by adding an extra 45 minutes to this film. With the short runtime of 1 hour 40 minutes an extra 45 minutes would not have felt drawn out and would have definitely shed some light on the outside world of which I was so intrigued by. Now that that is out the way I can get into all the things I love about this film.\n\nLet’s start with the visual and sound aspects of the film. Jeff Cutter the leading cinematographer of this film did an incredible job and has a heavy hand in why this film is so immersive and suspenseful. Jeff Cutter meticulously chose every camera angle and lighting condition for a very distinct reason: ambiguity. He only lets you see exactly what he wants you to see. In many parts of this film Howard is left excluded from shots, this very much so the intention. It leaves you wondering where Howard is at all times and give the feeling that he is always watching and listening. This is aided masterfully by the score of the film. Composed by Bear McCreary, his eerie and fast paced score does wonders. Leaving a feel of constant dread and giving the feeling that something is always about to happen even if it isn’t, keeping you in a constant state of anxiety. Only broken a few times by the use of classic 80’s songs that will have you bopping your head.\n\nNext we have editing and pacing. Editing and pacing are an extremely important yet an under appreciated aspect and can be the difference between a good and great movie. The pacing of 10 Cloverfield lane is impeccable and every scene and moment feels necessary and important to the progression of the plot. Often in films some scenes feel like filler in between scenes that actually mean something towards the plot, not in this film they all feel meaningful towards either the progression of the main plot or character arc of the amazing and relatable yet realistic characters in this movie. The editing 10 Cloverfield lane is calculated, this is shown within the first 5 minutes of the film, when Michelle’s car is rolling. The chaos of the car accident is repeatedly interrupted with short cuts of silence and black screens showing the production company’s logos. This really exaggerates the feeling of disorientation and chaos that one would feel in an actual car accident.\n\nWe now move on to undoubtedly the best part of the film: The cast and acting, more specifically John Goodman. He is otherworldly and in my opinion by far his best performance. He is articulate, educated yet indescribably terrifying. Throughout the entire movie he keeps the audience guessing, is he actually trying to help or is he a sadistic kidnapper. This is helped by his past being kept intentionally ambiguous. We never really learn about what actually happened in his past this makes him mysterious and makes his actions extremely unpredictable adding an extra layer of suspense to this already extremely suspenseful film. Even midway through the film where he seems to be a caring character there is still something that feels off with his character, something that I could not put my finger on. That is what is so good about his character. On top of that his lack of emotional range in his role makes him even more creepy as you never truly know what is going through his mind.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum we get Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Her emotional range in her role is about as vast as it gets. Her emotions mimic how the audience should be feeling in every scene. We always know exactly how she is feeling due to her amazing portrayal of Michelle, when she is scared the audience is scared, when she is comfortable the audience is comfortable. This allows John Goodmans actions to be even more unpredictable as if that could even be possible, as she can control how the audience is feeling and then bam John Goodman does something crazy that we would never expect.\n\nFinally John Gallagher Jr: He portrays a naive and innocent character that the audience can relate to. He gives us a break from the tension and allows us to breathe due to his humour. He is the least memorable character however he is very important to this film and it wouldn’t be the same without him. He gives the audience a sense of light heartedness and comfort in an incredibly uncomfortable film.\n\nOverall I think this film is a masterpiece, all of the aspects of this film work together like clockwork to create an incredibly concise and intense experience that keeps us on edge the entire time. It will be hard for J.J Abrams to top this one.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of December 8, 2021\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of December 2021\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2021\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

If it weren't for the stop-motion animation in this film, it would be simply awful. Awful acting, awful script, mediocre direction, this film has it all. \n\nBut once the monster appears on screen, none of that matters. Ray Harryhausen's animation is, as always, simply spellbinding, giving the monster, paradoxically, both a heightened reality (as it really is a physical object photographed in \"real life\") and a dreamlike quality. It's easy to see how Harryhausen's work set the standards for monster special effects until Star Wars and computer animation came along many years later.\n\n\nThis film is a particularly good example of his work for a number of reasons. There's only one monster (unlike the Sinbad/Jason/Titans movies), so all his effort is spent on that one \"character\". The monster also starts out small and grows huge by the end of the movie, allowing us to see it in a variety of settings. And, the fact that it's a humanoid (rather than a dinosaur or big octopus) allows it to \"act\" in a much more expressive manner (not unlike the original Kong). \n\nSo while this movie may qualify as little more than \"MST3K\" fodder as a science fiction work (did I mention how truly awful the script is?), as a piece of animation, it's a pure classic, deserving a space on your shelf next to King Kong, Snow White and Fantasia.\n\n- McGonigle\n- Aug 21, 2003\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ14\n\n- How long is 20 Million Miles to Earth?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - June 1957 (United States)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Italy\n    - West Germany\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Italian\n    - German\n- Also known as\n    - La bestia de otro planeta\n- Filming locations\n    - The Colosseum, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n- Production company\n    - Morningside Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 22 minutes\n- Color\n    - Black and White\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Spanish language plot outline for 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. Its plot was inspired by several short stories optioned from Clarke, primarily \"The Sentinel\" (1951) and \"Encounter in the Dawn\" (1953).[3] The film stars Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain. It follows a voyage by astronauts, scientists, and the sentient supercomputer HAL 9000 to Jupiter to investigate an alien monolith.\n\nThe film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of spaceflight, pioneering special effects, and ambiguous themes. Kubrick avoided conventional cinematic and narrative techniques; dialogue is used sparingly, and there are long sequences accompanied only by music. Shunning the convention that major film productions should feature original music, 2001: A Space Odyssey takes for its soundtrack numerous works of classical music, including pieces by Richard Strauss, Johann Strauss II, Aram Khachaturian, and György Ligeti.\n\nPolarising critics after its release, 2001: A Space Odyssey has since been subject to a variety of interpretations, ranging from the darkly apocalyptic to an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity. Critics noted its exploration of themes such as human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Kubrick the award for his direction of the visual effects, which apart from his lifetime-achievement Oscar, was the only Academy Award the director would receive.[4]\n\nThe film is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. In 1991, it was selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2022, 2001: A Space Odyssey placed in the top ten of Sight &amp; Sound's decennial critics' poll, and topped their directors' poll. A sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, was released in 1984, based on the novel 2010: Odyssey Two. Clarke published a novelisation of 2001 (in part written concurrently with the screenplay) soon after the film's 1968 release, for which Kubrick received co-writing credit.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn a prehistoric veld, a tribe of hominins is driven away from a water hole by a rival tribe, and the next day finds an alien monolith. The tribe learns how to use a bone as a weapon and, after a first hunt, use it to drive the rival tribe away.\n\nMillions of years later, Dr Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, an American lunar outpost. During a stopover at Space Station Five, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Floyd addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, a monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater Tycho. As he and others examine and photograph the object, it emits a high-powered radio signal.\n\nEighteen months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter, with mission pilots and scientists Dr Dave Bowman and Dr Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discovery's operations are controlled by HAL, a HAL 9000 computer with a human-like personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Bowman retrieves it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod, but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their backup 9000 computer indicate that HAL has made an error, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HAL's behaviour, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod so they can talk in private without HAL overhearing. They agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. HAL follows their conversation by lip reading.\n\nWhile Poole is floating away from his pod to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of the pod and attacks him, sending Poole tumbling away from the ship with a severed air line. Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole. While he is outside, HAL turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, HAL refuses to let him back in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Bowman releases Poole's body and opens the ship's emergency airlock with his remote manipulators. Lacking a helmet for his spacesuit, he positions his pod carefully so that when he jettisons the pod's door, he is propelled by the escaping air across the vacuum into Discovery's airlock. He enters HAL's processor core and begins disconnecting most of HAL's circuits, ignoring HAL's pleas to stop. When he is finished, a prerecorded video by Heywood Floyd plays, revealing that the mission's actual objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter.\n\nAt Jupiter, Bowman finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod to investigate. He is pulled into a vortex of coloured light and observes bizarre astronomical phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours as he passes by. Finally he finds himself in a large neoclassical bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light, which afterwards floats in space above the Earth.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Keir Dullea as Dr David Bowman\n- Gary Lockwood as Dr Frank Poole\n- William Sylvester as Dr Heywood Floyd\n- Daniel Richter as Moonwatcher, the chief man-ape\n- Leonard Rossiter as Dr Andrei Smyslov\n- Margaret Tyzack as Elena\n- Robert Beatty as Dr Ralph Halvorsen\n- Sean Sullivan as Dr Roy Michaels[5]\n- Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL 9000\n- Frank Miller as mission controller\n- Edwina Carroll as lunar shuttle stewardess\n- Penny Brahms as stewardess\n- Heather Downham as stewardess\n- Alan Gifford as Poole's father\n- Ann Gillis as Poole's mother\n- Maggie d'Abo as stewardess (Space Station 5 elevator) (uncredited)[6]\n- Chela Matthison as Mrs Turner, Space Station 5 reception (uncredited)[7]\n- Vivian Kubrick as Floyd's daughter, \"Squirt\" (uncredited)[8]\n- Kenneth Kendall as BBC announcer (uncredited)[9]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nAfter completing Dr. Strangelove (1964), director Stanley Kubrick told a publicist from Columbia Pictures that his next project would be about extraterrestrial life,[10][11] and resolved to make \"the proverbial good science fiction movie\".[12] How Kubrick became interested in creating a science fiction film is far from clear.[13] Biographer John Baxter notes possible inspirations in the late 1950s, including British productions featuring dramas on satellites and aliens modifying early humans, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)'s big budget CinemaScope production Forbidden Planet, and the slick widescreen cinematography and set design of Japanese kaiju (monster film) productions (such as Ishirō Honda and Eiji Tsuburaya's Godzilla films and Koji Shima's Warning from Space).[13]\n\nKubrick obtained financing and distribution from the American studio MGM with the selling point that the film could be marketed in the ultra-widescreen Cinerama format, which MGM had recently used on How the West Was Won.[14][15][13] It would be filmed and edited almost entirely in southern England, where Kubrick lived, using the facilities of MGM-British Studios and Shepperton Studios. MGM had subcontracted the production of the film to Kubrick's production company to qualify for the Eady Levy, a UK tax on box-office receipts used at the time to fund the production of films in Britain.[16] In a draft version of a contract with Kubrick's production company in May 1965, MGM suggested Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder and David Lean as possible replacements for Kubrick if he was unavailable.[17]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nKubrick's decision to avoid the fanciful portrayals of space found in standard popular science fiction films of the time led him to seek more realistic and accurate depictions of space travel. Illustrators such as Chesley Bonestell, Roy Carnon, and Richard McKenna were hired to produce concept drawings, sketches, and paintings of the space technology seen in the film.[18][19] Two educational films, the National Film Board of Canada's 1960 animated short documentary Universe and the 1964 New York World's Fair film To the Moon and Beyond, were major influences.[18]\n\nAccording to biographer Vincent LoBrutto, Universe was a visual inspiration to Kubrick.[20] The 29-minute film, which had also proved popular at NASA for its realistic portrayal of outer space, met \"the standard of dynamic visionary realism that he was looking for\". Wally Gentleman, one of the special-effects artists on Universe, worked briefly on 2001. Kubrick also asked Universe co-director Colin Low about animation camerawork, with Low recommending British mathematician Brian Salt, with whom Low and Roman Kroitor had previously worked on the 1957 still-animation documentary City of Gold.[21][22] Universe's narrator, actor Douglas Rain, was cast as the voice of HAL.[23] For the role of Heywood Floyd, MGM suggested casting a well-known actor such as Henry Fonda or George C. Scott.[24]\n\nAfter pre-production had begun, Kubrick saw To the Moon and Beyond, a film shown in the Transportation and Travel building at the 1964 World's Fair. It was filmed in Cinerama 360 and shown in the \"Moon Dome\". Kubrick hired the company that produced it, Graphic Films Corporation—which had been making films for NASA, the US Air Force, and various aerospace clients—as a design consultant. Graphic Films' Con Pederson, Lester Novros, and background artist Douglas Trumbull airmailed research-based concept sketches and notes covering the mechanics and physics of space travel, and created storyboards for the space flight sequences in 2001. Trumbull became a special effects supervisor on 2001.[18] Although Trumbull's association with Kubrick was a huge boost for his career, he swore afterwards that he would \"never work for someone else again\", in part because Kubrick \"was a hell of a taskmaster ... his level of quality-control bordered on perfectionism.\" The film would eventually earn an Oscar for best special effects, but the award went solely to Kubrick, with Trumbull receiving none of the accolade for his work. This led to threats of legal action and the two men  did not speak for a decade. Trumbull said after Kubrick's death that he \"was a genius\", someone whom Trumbull missed terribly.[25] (The credits for 2001 listed four effects contributors, including Trumbull. However, according to the rules of the Academy in effect at the time, only three persons could be nominated for their work on a single film, which would have resulted in the omission of either Trumbull, Tom Howard, Con Pederson or Wally Veevers. Ultimately, it was Kubrick's name that was submitted as a nominee in this category, resulting in his winning the award, which many consider a slight to the four men whose work contributed to the film's success.[26]).\n\n### Writing\n\nArthur C. Clarke in 1965, photographed in the Discovery's pod bay\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSearching for a collaborator in the science fiction community for the writing of the script, Kubrick was advised by a mutual acquaintance, Columbia Pictures staff member Roger Caras, to talk to writer Arthur C. Clarke, who lived in Ceylon. Although convinced that Clarke was \"a recluse, a nut who lives in a tree\", Kubrick allowed Caras to cable the film proposal to Clarke. Clarke's cabled response stated that he was \"frightfully interested in working with [that] enfant terrible\", and added \"what makes Kubrick think I'm a recluse?\"[20][27] Meeting for the first time at Trader Vic's in New York on 22 April 1964, the two began discussing the project that would take up the next four years of their lives.[28] Clarke kept a diary throughout his involvement with 2001, excerpts of which were published in 1972 as The Lost Worlds of 2001.[29]\n\nKubrick told Clarke he wanted to make a film about \"Man's relationship to the universe\",[30] and was, in Clarke's words, \"determined to create a work of art which would arouse the emotions of wonder, awe ... even, if appropriate, terror\".[28] Clarke offered Kubrick six of his short stories, and by May 1964, Kubrick had chosen \"The Sentinel\" as the source material for the film. In search of more material to expand the film's plot, the two spent the rest of 1964 reading books on science and anthropology, screening science fiction films, and brainstorming ideas.[31] They created the plot for 2001 by integrating several different short story plots written by Clarke, along with new plot segments requested by Kubrick for the film development, and then combined them all into a single script for 2001.[32][33] Clarke said that his 1953 story \"Encounter in the Dawn\" inspired the film's \"Dawn of Man\" sequence.[34]\n\nKubrick and Clarke privately referred to the project as How the Solar System Was Won, a reference to how it was a follow-on to MGM's Cinerama epic How the West Was Won.[13] On 23 February 1965, Kubrick issued a press release announcing the title as Journey Beyond The Stars.[35] Other titles considered included Universe, Tunnel to the Stars, and Planetfall. Expressing his high expectations for the thematic importance which he associated with the film, in April 1965, eleven months after they began working on the project, Kubrick selected 2001: A Space Odyssey; Clarke said the title was \"entirely\" Kubrick's idea.[36] Intending to set the film apart from the \"monsters-and-sex\" type of science-fiction films of the time, Kubrick used Homer's The Odyssey as both a model of literary merit and a source of inspiration for the title. Kubrick said, \"It occurred to us that for the Greeks the vast stretches of the sea must have had the same sort of mystery and remoteness that space has for our generation.\"[37]\n\nHow much would we appreciate La Gioconda today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas: \"This lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth\"—or \"because she's hiding a secret from her lover\"? It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a reality other than his own. I don't want that to happen to 2001.\n\nOriginally, Kubrick and Clarke had planned to develop a 2001 novel first, free of the constraints of film, and then write the screenplay. They planned the writing credits to be \"Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, based on a novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick\" to reflect their preeminence in their respective fields.[39] In practice, the screenplay developed in parallel with the novel, with only some elements being common to both. In a 1970 interview, Kubrick said:\n\nThere are a number of differences between the book and the movie. The novel, for example, attempts to explain things much more explicitly than the film does, which is inevitable in a verbal medium. The novel came about after we did a 130-page prose treatment of the film at the very outset. ... Arthur took all the existing material, plus an impression of some of the rushes, and wrote the novel. As a result, there's a difference between the novel and the film ... I think that the divergences between the two works are interesting.[40]\n\nIn the end, Clarke and Kubrick wrote parts of the novel and screenplay simultaneously, with the film version being released before the book version was published. Clarke opted for clearer explanations of the mysterious monolith and Star Gate in the novel; Kubrick made the film more cryptic by minimising dialogue and explanation.[41] Kubrick said the film is \"basically a visual, nonverbal experience\" that \"hits the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does, or painting\".[42]\n\nThe screenplay credits were shared whereas the 2001 novel, released shortly after the film, was attributed to Clarke alone. Clarke wrote later that \"the nearest approximation to the complicated truth\" is that the screenplay should be credited to \"Kubrick and Clarke\" and the novel to \"Clarke and Kubrick\".[43] Early reports about tensions involved in the writing of the film script appeared to reach a point where Kubrick was allegedly so dissatisfied with the collaboration that he approached other writers who could replace Clarke, including Michael Moorcock and J. G. Ballard. But they felt it would be disloyal to accept Kubrick's offer.[44] In Michael Benson's 2018 book Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece, the actual relationship between Clarke and Kubrick was more complex, involving an extended interaction of Kubrick's multiple requests for Clarke to write new plot lines for various segments of the film, which Clarke was expected to withhold from publication until after the release of the film while receiving advances on his salary from Kubrick during film production. Clarke agreed to this, though apparently he did make several requests for Kubrick to allow him to develop his new plot lines into separate publishable stories while film production continued, which Kubrick consistently denied based on Clarke's contractual obligation to withhold publication until release of the film.[33]\n\nAstronomer Carl Sagan wrote in his 1973 book The Cosmic Connection that Clarke and Kubrick had asked him how to best depict extraterrestrial intelligence. While acknowledging Kubrick's desire to use actors to portray humanoid aliens for convenience's sake, Sagan argued that alien life forms were unlikely to bear any resemblance to terrestrial life, and that to do so would introduce \"at least an element of falseness\" to the film. Sagan proposed that the film should simply suggest extraterrestrial superintelligence, rather than depict it. He attended the premiere and was \"pleased to see that I had been of some help\".[45] Sagan had met with Clarke and Kubrick only once, in 1964; and Kubrick subsequently directed several attempts to portray credible aliens, only to abandon the idea near the end of post-production. Benson asserts it is unlikely that Sagan's advice had any direct influence.[33] Kubrick hinted at the nature of the mysterious unseen alien race in 2001 by suggesting that given millions of years of evolution, they progressed from biological beings to \"immortal machine entities\" and then into \"beings of pure energy and spirit\" with \"limitless capabilities and ungraspable intelligence\".[46]\n\nIn a 1980 interview (not released during Kubrick's lifetime), Kubrick explains one of the film's closing scenes, where Bowman is depicted in old age after his journey through the Star Gate:\n\nThe idea was supposed to be that he is taken in by godlike entities, creatures of pure energy and intelligence with no shape or form. They put him in what I suppose you could describe as a human zoo to study him, and his whole life passes from that point on in that room. And he has no sense of time. ... [W]hen they get finished with him, as happens in so many myths of all cultures in the world, he is transformed into some kind of super being and sent back to Earth, transformed and made some kind of superman. We have to only guess what happens when he goes back. It is the pattern of a great deal of mythology, and that is what we were trying to suggest.[47]\n\nThe script went through many stages. In early 1965, when backing was secured for the film, Clarke and Kubrick still had no firm idea of what would happen to Bowman after the Star Gate sequence. Initially all of Discovery's astronauts were to survive the journey; by 3 October, Clarke and Kubrick had decided to make Bowman the sole survivor and have him regress to infancy. By 17 October, Kubrick had come up with what Clarke called a \"wild idea of slightly fag robots who create a Victorian environment to put our heroes at their ease\".[43] HAL 9000 was originally named Athena after the Greek goddess of wisdom and had a feminine voice and persona.[43]\n\nEarly drafts included a prologue containing interviews with scientists about extraterrestrial life,[48] voice-over narration (a feature in all of Kubrick's previous films),[a] a stronger emphasis on the prevailing Cold War balance of terror, and a different and more explicitly explained breakdown for HAL.[50][51] Other changes include a different monolith for the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence, discarded when early prototypes reflected light poorly; the use of Saturn as the final destination of the Discovery mission rather than Jupiter, discarded when the special effects team could not develop a convincing rendition of Saturn's rings; and the finale of the Star Child exploding nuclear weapons carried by Earth-orbiting satellites,[51] which Kubrick discarded for its similarity to his previous film, Dr. Strangelove.[48][51] The finale and many of the other discarded screenplay ideas survived in Clarke's novel.[51]\n\nKubrick made further changes to make the film more nonverbal, to communicate on a visual and visceral level rather than through conventional narrative.[38] By the time shooting began, Kubrick had removed much of the dialogue and narration.[52] Long periods without dialogue permeate the film: the film has no dialogue for roughly the first and last twenty minutes,[53] as well as for the 10 minutes from Floyd's Moonbus landing near the monolith until Poole watches a BBC newscast on Discovery. What dialogue remains is notable for its banality (making the computer HAL seem to have more emotion than the humans) when juxtaposed with the epic space scenes.[52] Vincent LoBrutto wrote that Clarke's novel has its own \"strong narrative structure\" and precision, while the narrative of the film remains symbolic, in accord with Kubrick's final intentions.[54]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on 29 December 1965, in Stage H at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, England. The studio was chosen because it could house the 60-by-120-by-60-foot (18 m × 37 m × 18 m) pit for the Tycho crater excavation scene, the first to be shot. In January 1966, the production moved to the smaller MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, where the live-action and special-effects filming was done, starting with the scenes involving Floyd on the Orion spaceplane;[55] it was described as a \"huge throbbing nerve center ... with much the same frenetic atmosphere as a Cape Kennedy blockhouse during the final stages of Countdown.\"[56] The only scene not filmed in a studio—and the last live-action scene shot for the film—was the skull-smashing sequence, in which Moonwatcher (Richter) wields his newfound bone \"weapon-tool\" against a pile of nearby animal bones. A small elevated platform was built in a field near the studio so that the camera could shoot upward with the sky as background, avoiding cars and trucks passing by in the distance.[57][58] The Dawn of Man sequence that opens the film was shot at Borehamwood with John Alcott as cinematographer after Geoffrey Unsworth left to work on other projects.[59][60] The still photographs used as backgrounds for the Dawn of Man sequence were taken at the Spitzkoppe mountains in what was then South West Africa.[61][62]\n\nFilming of actors was completed in September 1967,[63] and from June 1966 until March 1968, Kubrick spent most of his time working on the 205 special-effects shots in the film.[40] He ordered the special-effects technicians to use the painstaking process of creating all visual effects seen in the film \"in camera\", avoiding degraded picture quality from the use of blue screen and travelling matte techniques. Although this technique, known as \"held takes\", resulted in a much better image, it meant exposed film would be stored for long periods of time between shots, sometimes as long as a year.[64] In March 1968, Kubrick finished the \"pre-premiere\" editing of the film, making his final cuts just days before the film's general release in April 1968.[40]\n\nThe film was announced in 1965 as a \"Cinerama\"[65] film and was photographed in Super Panavision 70 (which uses a 65 mm negative combined with spherical lenses to create an aspect ratio of 2.20:1). It would eventually be released in a \"roadshow\" 70 mm version and a later general release 35 mm version.[66][67] Colour processing and 35 mm release prints were done using Technicolor's dye transfer process. The 70 mm prints were made by MGM Laboratories, Inc. on Metrocolor. The production was $4.5 million over the initial $6 million budget and 16 months behind schedule.[68] For the opening sequence involving tribes of apes, professional mime Daniel Richter played the lead ape and choreographed the movements of the other man-apes, who were mostly portrayed by his mime troupe.[57] Kubrick and Clarke consulted IBM on plans for HAL, though plans to use the company's logo never materialised.[61]\n\n### Post-production\n\nFor cuts made after the film premiered, see the Theatrical run section below.\n\nThe film was edited before it was publicly screened, cutting out, among other things, a painting class on the lunar base that included Kubrick's daughters, additional scenes of life on the base, and Floyd buying a bush baby for his daughter from a department store via videophone.[69] A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life,[70] was removed after an early screening for MGM executives.[71]\n\n### Music\n\nFrom early in production, Kubrick decided that he wanted the film to be a primarily nonverbal experience[72] that did not rely on the traditional techniques of narrative cinema, and in which music would play a vital role in evoking particular moods. About half the music in the film appears either before the first line of dialogue or after the final line. Almost no music is heard during scenes with dialogue.[73] The film is notable for its innovative use of classical music taken from existing commercial recordings. Most feature films, then and now, are typically accompanied by elaborate film scores or songs written specially for them by professional composers. In the early stages of production, Kubrick commissioned a score for 2001 from Hollywood composer Alex North, who had written the score for Spartacus and also had worked on Dr. Strangelove.[74][75] During post-production, Kubrick chose to abandon North's music in favour of the classical pieces which he had earlier chosen to guide North's score. North did not know that his score had been abandoned in favour of the temporary music pieces until he saw the film at its premiere.[73]\n\n## Design and visual effects\n\n### Costumes and set design\n\nKubrick involved himself in every aspect of production, even choosing the fabric for his actors' costumes,[76] and selecting notable pieces of contemporary furniture for use in the film. When Floyd exits the Space Station 5 elevator, he is greeted by an attendant seated behind a slightly modified George Nelson Action Office desk from Herman Miller's 1964 \"Action Office\" series.[b][77][c] Danish designer Arne Jacobsen designed the cutlery used by the Discovery astronauts in the film.[78][79][80]\n\nOther examples of modern furniture in the film are the bright red Djinn chairs seen prominently throughout the space station[81][82] and Eero Saarinen's 1956 pedestal tables. Olivier Mourgue, designer of the Djinn chair, has used the connection to 2001 in his advertising; a frame from the film's space station sequence and three production stills appear on the homepage of Mourgue's website.[83] Shortly before Kubrick's death, film critic Alexander Walker informed Kubrick of Mourgue's use of the film, joking to him \"You're keeping the price up.\"[84] Commenting on their use in the film, Walker writes:\n\nEveryone recalls one early sequence in the film, the space hotel, primarily because the custom-made Olivier Mourgue furnishings, those foam-filled sofas, undulant and serpentine, are covered in scarlet fabric and are the first stabs of colour one sees. They resemble Rorschach \"blots\" against the pristine purity of the rest of the lobby.[85]\n\nDetailed instructions in relatively small print for various technological devices appear at several points in the film, the most visible of which are the lengthy instructions for the zero-gravity toilet on the Aries Moon shuttle. Similar detailed instructions for replacing the explosive bolts also appear on the hatches of the EVA pods, most visibly in close-up just before Bowman's pod leaves the ship to rescue Poole.[d]\n\nThe film features an extensive use of Eurostile Bold Extended, Futura and other sans serif typefaces as design elements of the 2001 world.[87] Computer displays show high-resolution fonts, colour, and graphics that were far in advance of what most computers were capable of in the 1960s, when the film was made.[86]\n\n### Design of the monolith\n\nKubrick was personally involved in the design of the monolith and its form for the film. The first design for the monolith for the 2001 film was a transparent tetrahedral pyramid. This was taken from the short story \"The Sentinel\" that the first story was based on.[88][89]\n\nA London firm was approached by Kubrick to provide a 12-foot (3.7 m) transparent plexiglass pyramid, and due to construction constraints they recommended a flat slab shape. Kubrick approved, but was disappointed with the glassy appearance of the transparent prop on set, leading art director Anthony Masters to suggest making the monolith's surface matte black.[33]\n\n### Models\n\nModern replica of the Discovery One spaceship model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo heighten the reality of the film, intricate models of the various spacecraft and locations were built. Their sizes ranged from about two-foot-long models of satellites and the Aries translunar shuttle up to the 55-foot (17 m)-long model of the Discovery One spacecraft. \"In-camera\" techniques were again used as much as possible to combine models and background shots together to prevent degradation of the image through duplication.[90][91]\n\nIn shots where there was no perspective change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out of the photographic print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.[90]\n\nShots where the spacecraft had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots the model was stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on the same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, in order to keep the entire model in focus (and preserve its sense of scale), the camera's aperture was stopped down for maximum depth-of-field, and each frame was exposed for several seconds.[92] Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand-tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.[90][93]\n\nSome shots required exposing the film again to record previously filmed live-action shots of the people appearing in the windows of the spacecraft or structures. This was achieved by projecting the window action onto the models in a separate camera pass or, when two-dimensional photographs were used, projecting from the backside through a hole cut in the photograph.[92]\n\nAll of the shots required multiple takes so that some film could be developed and printed to check exposure, density, alignment of elements, and to supply footage used for other photographic effects, such as for matting.[90][93]\n\n### Rotating sets\n\nThe \"centrifuge\" set used for filming scenes depicting interior of the spaceship Discovery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor spacecraft interior shots, ostensibly containing a giant centrifuge that produces artificial gravity, Kubrick had a 30-short-ton (27 t) rotating \"ferris wheel\" built by Vickers-Armstrong Engineering Group at a cost of $750,000 (equivalent to $6,800,000 in 2024[94]). The set was 38 feet (12 m) in diameter and 10 feet (3.0 m) wide.[95] Various scenes in the Discovery centrifuge were shot by securing set pieces within the wheel, then rotating it while the actor walked or ran in sync with its motion, keeping him at the bottom of the wheel as it turned. The camera could be fixed to the inside of the rotating wheel to show the actor walking completely \"around\" the set, or mounted in such a way that the wheel rotated independently of the stationary camera, as in the jogging scene where the camera appears to alternately precede and follow the running actor.[96]\n\nThe shots where the actors appear on opposite sides of the wheel required one of the actors to be strapped securely into place at the \"top\" of the wheel as it moved to allow the other actor to walk to the \"bottom\" of the wheel to join him. The most notable case is when Bowman enters the centrifuge from the central hub on a ladder and joins Poole, who is eating on the other side of the centrifuge. This required Gary Lockwood to be strapped into a seat while Keir Dullea walked toward him from the opposite side of the wheel as it turned with him.[96]\n\nAnother rotating set appeared in an earlier sequence on board the Aries trans-lunar shuttle. A stewardess is shown preparing in-flight meals, then carrying them into a circular walkway. Attached to the set as it rotates 180 degrees, the camera's point of view remains constant, and she appears to walk up the \"side\" of the circular walkway, and steps, now in an \"upside-down\" orientation, into a connecting hallway.[97]\n\n### Zero-gravity effects\n\nZero-gravity effect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe realistic-looking effects of the astronauts floating weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached to the top of the set and placing the camera beneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the wires and appeared to float. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's recovery of him, a stuntman on a wire portrayed the movements of an unconscious man and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space.[98] The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the EVA pod was done similarly: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically oriented airlock. At the proper moment, the stage-hand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back toward the hatch.[99]\n\nThe methods used were alleged to have placed stuntman Bill Weston's life in danger. Weston recalled that he filmed one sequence without air-holes in his suit, risking asphyxiation. \"Even when the tank was feeding air into the suit, there was no place for the carbon dioxide Weston exhaled to go. So it simply built up inside, incrementally causing a heightened heart rate, rapid breathing, fatigue, clumsiness, and eventually, unconsciousness.\"[100] Weston said Kubrick was warned \"we've got to get him back\" but reportedly replied, \"Damn it, we just started. Leave him up there! Leave him up there!\"[101] When Weston lost consciousness, filming ceased, and he was brought down. \"They brought the tower in, and I went looking for Stanley, ... I was going to shove MGM right up his ... And the thing is, Stanley had left the studio and sent Victor [Lyndon, the associate producer] to talk to me.\" Weston claimed Kubrick fled the studio for \"two or three days. ... I know he didn't come in the next day, and I'm sure it wasn't the day after. Because I was going to do him.\"[102]\n\n### \"Star Gate\" sequence\n\n()\n\nDuring the \"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite\" sequence, Bowman takes a trip through the \"Star Gate\" that involves the innovative use of slit-scan photography to create the visual effects.\n\nThe coloured lights in the Star Gate sequence were accomplished by slit-scan photography of thousands of high-contrast images on film, including Op art paintings, architectural drawings, Moiré patterns, printed circuits, and electron-microscope photographs of molecular and crystal structures. Known to staff as \"Manhattan Project\", the shots of various nebula-like phenomena, including the expanding star field, were coloured paints and chemicals swirling in a pool-like device known as a cloud tank, shot in slow motion in a dark room.[103] The live-action landscape shots were filmed in the Hebridean islands, the mountains of northern Scotland, and Monument Valley. The colouring and negative-image effects were achieved with different colour filters in the process of making duplicate negatives in an optical printer.[104]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nA bone-club and orbiting satellite are juxtaposed in the film's famous match cut\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNot one foot of this film was made with computer-generated special effects. Everything you see in this film or saw in this film was done physically or chemically, one way or the other.\n\n2001 contains a famous example of a match cut, a type of cut in which two shots are matched by action or subject matter.[106][107][108][109] After Moonwatcher uses a bone to kill another ape at the watering hole, he throws it triumphantly into the air; as the bone spins in the air, the film cuts to an orbiting satellite, marking the end of the prologue.[110] The match cut draws a connection between the two objects as exemplars of primitive and advanced tools respectively, and demonstrates humanity's technological progress since the time of early hominids.[111]\n\n2001 pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting. Kubrick used the technique to produce the backdrops in the Africa scenes and the scene when astronauts walk on the Moon.[112][60]\n\nThe technique consisted of a separate scenery projector set at a right angle to the camera and a half-silvered mirror placed at an angle in front that reflected the projected image forward in line with the camera lens onto a backdrop of retroreflective material. The reflective directional screen behind the actors could reflect light from the projected image 100 times more efficiently than the foreground subject did. The lighting of the foreground subject had to be balanced with the image from the screen, so that the part of the scenery image that fell on the foreground subject was too faint to show on the finished film. The exception was the eyes of the leopard in the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence, which glowed due to the projector illumination. Kubrick described this as \"a happy accident\".[113]\n\nFront projection had been used in smaller settings before 2001, mostly for still photography or television production, using small still images and projectors. The expansive backdrops for the African scenes required a screen 40 feet (12 m) tall and 110 feet (34 m) wide, far larger than had been used before. When the reflective material was applied to the backdrop in 100-foot (30 m) strips, variations at the seams of the strips led to visual artefacts; to solve this, the crew tore the material into smaller chunks and applied them in a random \"camouflage\" pattern on the backdrop. The existing projectors using 4-by-5-inch (10 cm × 13 cm) transparencies resulted in grainy images when projected that large, so the crew worked with MGM's special-effects supervisor Tom Howard to build a custom projector using 8-by-10-inch (20 cm × 25 cm) transparencies, which required the largest water-cooled arc lamp available.[113] The technique was used widely in the film industry thereafter until it was replaced by blue/green screen systems in the 1990s.[113]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe initial MGM soundtrack album release contained none of the material from the altered and uncredited rendition of Ligeti's Aventures used in the film, but used a different recording of Also sprach Zarathustra (performed by the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Karl Böhm) from that heard in the film, and a longer excerpt of Lux Aeterna than in the film.[114]\n\nIn 1996, Turner Entertainment/Rhino Records released a new soundtrack on CD that included the film's rendition of \"Aventures\", the version of \"Zarathustra\" used in the film, and the shorter version of Lux Aeterna from the film. As additional \"bonus tracks\" at the end, the CD includes the versions of \"Zarathustra\" and Lux Aeterna on the old MGM soundtrack album, an unaltered performance of \"Aventures\", and a nine-minute compilation of all of HAL's dialogue.[114]\n\nAlex North's unused music was first released in Telarc's issue of the main theme on Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, a compilation album by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. All of the music North originally wrote was recorded commercially by his friend and colleague Jerry Goldsmith with the National Philharmonic Orchestra and released on Varèse Sarabande CDs shortly after Telarc's first theme release and before North's death. Eventually, a mono mix-down of North's original recordings was released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.[115]\n\n## Theatrical run and post-premiere cuts\n\nOriginal trailer for 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for a Christmas 1966 release, but was later delayed to early 1967, then later to October 1967.[116] The film's world premiere was on 2 April 1968,[117][118] at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C.,[119] with a 160-minute cut.[120] It opened the next day at the Loew's Capitol in New York and the following day at the Warner Hollywood Theatre in Los Angeles.[120] The original version was also shown in Boston.\n\nKubrick and editor Ray Lovejoy edited the film between 5 and 9 April 1968. Kubrick's rationale for trimming the film was to tighten the narrative. Reviews suggested the film suffered from its departure from traditional cinematic storytelling.[121] Kubrick said, \"I didn't believe that the trims made a critical difference. ... The people who like it like it no matter what its length, and the same holds true for the people who hate it.\"[69] The cut footage is reported as being 19[122][123] or 17[124] minutes long. It includes scenes revealing details about life on Discovery: additional space walks, Bowman retrieving a spare part from an octagonal corridor, elements from the Poole murder sequence—including space-walk preparation and HAL turning off radio contact with Poole—and a close-up of Bowman picking up a slipper during his walk in the alien room.[69] Jerome Agel describes the cut scenes as comprising \"Dawn of Man, Orion, Poole exercising in the centrifuge, and Poole's pod exiting from Discovery.\"[125] The new cut was approximately 139 minutes long.[2]\n\nAccording to his brother-in-law, Jan Harlan, Kubrick was adamant that the trims were never to be seen and had the negatives, which he had kept in his garage, burned shortly before his death. This was confirmed by former Kubrick assistant Leon Vitali: \"I'll tell you right now, okay, on Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Barry Lyndon, some little parts of 2001, we had thousands of cans of negative outtakes and print, which we had stored in an area at his house where we worked out of, which he personally supervised the loading of it to a truck and then I went down to a big industrial waste lot and burned it. That's what he wanted.\"[126] However, in December 2010, Douglas Trumbull, the film's visual effects supervisor, announced that Warner Bros. had found 17 minutes of lost footage from the post-premiere cuts, \"perfectly preserved\", in a Kansas salt mine vault used by Warners for storage.[127][125][124] No plans have been announced for the rediscovered footage.[128]\n\nThe revised version was ready for the expansion of the roadshow release to four other US cities (Chicago, Denver, Detroit and Houston), on 10 April 1968, and internationally in five cities the following day,[125][129] where the shortened version was shown in 70mm format in the 2.21:1 aspect ratio and used a six-track stereo magnetic soundtrack.[125]\n\nBy the end of May, the film had opened in 22 cities in the United States and Canada and in another 36 in June.[130] The general release of the film in its 35 mm anamorphic format took place in autumn 1968 and used either a four-track magnetic stereo soundtrack or an optical monaural one.[131]\n\nThe original 70-millimetre release, like many Super Panavision 70 films of the era such as Grand Prix, was advertised as being in \"Cinerama\" in cinemas equipped with special projection optics and a deeply curved screen. In standard cinemas, the film was identified as a 70-millimetre production. The original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey in 70-millimetre Cinerama with six-track sound played continually for more than a year in several venues, and for 103 weeks in Los Angeles.[131]\n\nAs was typical of many high-budget films of the era, it was released both in a \"roadshow\" 70 mm version and a later 35 mm general release version. The entrance music, intermission music (and intermission altogether), and exit music were cut from most prints of the latter version, although these have been restored to most DVD releases.[132][133]\n\n## Reception and legacy\n\n### Box office\n\nIn its first nine weeks from 22 locations, it grossed $2 million—equivalent to $20.79 million in 2024—in the United States and Canada.[130] The film earned $8.5 million in theatrical gross rentals from roadshow engagements throughout 1968,[134][135] contributing to North American rentals of $16.4 million and worldwide rentals of $21.9 million during its original release.[136] The film's high costs, of approximately $10.5 million,[117][68] meant that the initial returns from the 1968 release left it $800,000 in the red; but the successful re-release in 1971 made it profitable.[137][138][139] By June 1974, the film had rentals from the United States and Canada of $20.3 million (gross of $58 million)[137] and international rentals of $7.5 million.[140] The film had a reissue on a test basis on 24 July 1974 at the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles and grossed $53,000 in its first week, which led to an expanded reissue.[140] Further re-releases followed, giving a cumulative gross of over $60 million in the United States and Canada.[141] Taking its re-releases into account, it is the highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States and Canada.[142] Worldwide, it has grossed $146 million across all releases,[e] although some estimates place the gross higher, at over $190 million.[144]\n\n### Critical response\n\nSeattle writer Walt Crowley drew this cartoon to illustrate his favorable review in the Seattle underground paper Helix, in which he accused mainstream critics of \"approach[ing] Kandinsky with a Norman Rockwell mentality.\"[145]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey polarised critical opinion, receiving both praise and derision, with many New York–based critics being especially harsh. Kubrick called them \"dogmatically atheistic and materialistic and earthbound\".[146] Some critics viewed the original 161-minute cut shown at premieres in Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles.[147] Keir Dullea says that during the New York premiere, 250 people walked out; in L.A., Rock Hudson not only left early but \"was heard to mutter, 'What is this bullshit?'\"[146] \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is about?\"[148] \"But a few months into the release, they realised a lot of people were watching it while smoking funny cigarettes. Someone in San Francisco even ran right through the screen screaming: 'It's God!' So they came up with a new poster that said: '2001 – the ultimate trip!'\"[149]\n\nIn The New Yorker, Penelope Gilliatt said it was \"some kind of great film, and an unforgettable endeavor ... The film is hypnotically entertaining, and it is funny without once being gaggy, but it is also rather harrowing.\"[150] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was \"the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed (sometimes forlornly) that the industry might some day give them. It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film, an awesome realization of the spatial future ... it is a milestone, a landmark for a spacemark, in the art of film.\"[151] Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor felt that 2001 was \"a brilliant intergalactic satire on modern technology. It's also a dazzling 160-minute tour on the Kubrick filmship through the universe out there beyond our earth.\"[152] Philip French wrote that the film was \"perhaps the first multi-million-dollar supercolossal movie since D. W. Griffith's Intolerance fifty years ago which can be regarded as the work of one man ... Space Odyssey is important as the high-water mark of science-fiction movie making, or at least of the genre's futuristic branch.\"[153] The Boston Globe's review called it \"the world's most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before or, for that matter, anywhere ... The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.\"[154] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his original review, saying the film \"succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale\".[53] He later put it on his Top 10 list for Sight &amp; Sound.[155] Time provided at least seven different mini-reviews in various issues in 1968, each slightly more positive than the preceding one; in the final review of 27 December 1968, the magazine called 2001 \"an epic film about the history and future of mankind, brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick. The special effects are mindblowing.\"[156]\n\nOthers were unimpressed. Pauline Kael called it \"a monumentally unimaginative movie\".[157] Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic described it as \"a film that is so dull, it even dulls our interest in the technical ingenuity for the sake of which Kubrick has allowed it to become dull\".[158] The Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky found the film to be an inadequate addition to the science fiction genre of filmmaking.[33] Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that it was \"somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring\".[159] Variety's Robert B. Frederick ('Robe') believed it was a \"[b]ig, beautiful, but plodding sci-fi epic ... A major achievement in cinematography and special effects, 2001 lacks dramatic appeal to a large degree and only conveys suspense after the halfway mark.\"[121] Andrew Sarris called it \"one of the grimmest films I have ever seen in my life ... 2001 is a disaster because it is much too abstract to make its abstract points.\"[160] (Sarris reversed his opinion upon a second viewing, and declared, \"2001 is indeed a major work by a major artist.\"[161]) John Simon felt it was \"a regrettable failure, although not a total one. This film is fascinating when it concentrates on apes or machines ... and dreadful when it deals with the in-betweens: humans ... 2001, for all its lively visual and mechanical spectacle, is a kind of space-Spartacus and, more pretentious still, a shaggy God story.\"[162] Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. deemed the film \"morally pretentious, intellectually obscure and inordinately long ... a film out of control\".[163] In a 2001 review, the BBC said that its slow pacing often alienates modern audiences more than it did upon its initial release.[164]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 92% based on 118 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"One of the most influential of all sci-fi films – and one of the most controversial – Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity – and folly – of mankind.\"[118] Review aggregator Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 84 out of 100, based on 25 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[165]\n2001 was the only science fiction film to make Sight &amp; Sound's 2012 list of the ten best films,[166] and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of greatest science fiction films of all time.[167] In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed it as the 19th best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.[168] Other lists that include the film are 50 Films to See Before You Die (#6), The Village Voice 100 Best Films of the 20th century (#11), and Roger Ebert's Top Ten (1968) (#2). In 1995, the Vatican included it in a list of 45 important films, under the category of \"Art\".[169] In 1998, Time Out conducted a reader's poll and 2001: A Space Odyssey was voted as ninth on the list of \"greatest films of all time\".[170] Entertainment Weekly voted it no. 26 on their list of 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.[171] In 2017, Empire magazine's readers' poll ranked it 21st on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\".[172] In the Sight &amp; Sound poll of 480 directors published in December 2022, 2001: A Space Odyssey was voted as the Greatest Film of All Time, ahead of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.[173][174]\n\n### Science fiction writers\n\nThe film won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, as voted by science fiction fans and published science-fiction writers.[175] Ray Bradbury praised the film's photography but disliked the banality of most of the dialogue and believed that the audience does not care when Poole dies.[176] Both he and Lester del Rey disliked the film's feeling of sterility and blandness in the human encounters amidst the technological wonders, while both praised the pictorial element of the film. Reporting that \"half the audience had left by intermission\", del Rey described the film as dull, confusing, and boring (\"the first of the New Wave-Thing movies, with the usual empty symbols\"), predicting \"[i]t will probably be a box-office disaster, too, and thus set major science-fiction movie making back another ten years\".[177]\n\nSamuel R. Delany was impressed by how the film undercuts the audience's normal sense of space and orientation in several ways. Like Bradbury, Delany noticed the banality of the dialogue (he stated that characters say nothing meaningful), but regarded this as a dramatic strength, a prelude to the rebirth at the conclusion of the film.[178]\n\nWithout analysing the film in detail, Isaac Asimov spoke well of it in his autobiography and other essays. James P. Hogan liked the film but complained that the ending did not make any sense to him, leading to a bet about whether he could write something better: \"I stole Arthur's plot idea shamelessly and produced Inherit the Stars.\"[179]\n\n### Awards and honours\n\n| Award                                  | Category                                                    | Nominee(s)                                     | Result     | Ref.    |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------|---------|\n| Academy Awards                         | Best Director                                               | Stanley Kubrick                                | Nominated  | [180]   |\n| Academy Awards                         | Best Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen | Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C.

In his monograph for BFI analysing the film, Peter Krämer summarised the diverse interpretations as ranging from those who saw it as darkly apocalyptic in tone to those who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of mankind and humanity.[197] Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its implications for humanity's origins and destiny in the universe[198] to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes, such as the meaning of the monolith, or the fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about the plot, in particular the causes of HAL's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).[199][47][200][201]\n\n### Audiences vs. critics\n\nA spectrum of diverse interpretative opinions would form after the film's release, appearing to divide theatre audiences from the opinions of critics. Krämer writes: \"Many people sent letters to Kubrick to tell him about their responses to 2001, most of them regarding the film—in particular the ending—as an optimistic statement about humanity, which is seen to be born and reborn. The film's reviewers and academic critics, by contrast, have tended to understand the film as a pessimistic account of human nature and humanity's future. The most extreme of these interpretations state that the foetus floating above the Earth will destroy it.\"[202]\n\nClosing scene of Dr. Strangelove and Kubrick's sardonic fulfilment of a nuclear nightmare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSome of the critics' cataclysmic interpretations were informed by Kubrick's prior direction of the Cold War film Dr. Strangelove, immediately before 2001, which resulted in dark speculation about the nuclear weapons orbiting the Earth in 2001. These interpretations were challenged by Clarke, who said: \"Many readers have interpreted the last paragraph of the book to mean that he (the foetus) destroyed Earth, perhaps for the purpose of creating a new Heaven. This idea never occurred to me; it seems clear that he triggered the orbiting nuclear bombs harmlessly ...\".[197] In response to Jeremy Bernstein's dark interpretation of the film's ending, Kubrick said: \"The book does not end with the destruction of the Earth.\"[197]\n\nRegarding the film as a whole, Kubrick encouraged people to make their own interpretations and refused to offer an explanation of \"what really happened\". In a 1968 interview with Playboy, he said:\n\nYou're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film—and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level—but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point.[46]\n\nIn a subsequent discussion of the film with Joseph Gelmis, Kubrick said his main aim was to avoid \"intellectual verbalization\" and reach \"the viewer's subconscious\". But he said he did not strive for ambiguity—it was simply an inevitable outcome of making the film nonverbal. Still, he acknowledged this ambiguity was an invaluable asset to the film. He was willing then to give a fairly straightforward explanation of the plot on what he called the \"simplest level\", but unwilling to discuss the film's metaphysical interpretation, which he felt should be left up to viewers.[203]\n\n### Meaning of the monolith\n\nFor some readers, Clarke's more straightforward novel based on the script is key to interpreting the film. The novel explicitly identifies the monolith as a tool created by an alien race who have been through many stages of evolution, moving from organic form to biomechanical, and finally achieving a state of pure energy. These aliens travel the cosmos assisting lesser species to take evolutionary steps. Conversely, film critic Penelope Houston wrote in 1971 that because the novel differs in many key aspects from the film, it perhaps should not be regarded as the skeleton key to unlock it.[204]\n\nMultiple interpretations of the meaning of the monolith have been examined in the critical reception of the film\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarolyn Geduld writes that what \"structurally unites all four episodes of the film\" is the monolith, the film's largest and most unresolvable enigma.[205] Vincent LoBrutto's biography of Kubrick says that for many, Clarke's novel supplements the understanding of the monolith which is more ambiguously depicted in the film.[206] Similarly, Geduld observes that \"the monolith ... has a very simple explanation in Clarke's novel\", though she later asserts that even the novel does not fully explain the ending.[205]\n\nBob McClay's Rolling Stone review describes a parallel between the monolith's first appearance in which tool usage is imparted to the apes (thus 'beginning' mankind) and the completion of \"another evolution\" in the fourth and final encounter[207] with the monolith. In a similar vein, Tim Dirks ends his synopsis saying \"[t]he cyclical evolution from ape to man to spaceman to angel-starchild-superman is complete.\"[208]\n\nHumanity's first and second encounters with the monolith have visual elements in common; both the apes, and later the astronauts, touch it gingerly with their hands, and both sequences conclude with near-identical images of the Sun appearing directly over it (the first with a crescent moon adjacent to it in the sky, the second with a near-identical crescent Earth in the same position), echoing the Sun–Earth–Moon alignment seen in the film's opening.[209] The second encounter also suggests the triggering of the monolith's radio signal to Jupiter by the presence of humans, echoing the premise of Clarke's source story \"The Sentinel\".[210]\n\nThe monolith is the subject of the film's final line of dialogue (spoken at the end of the \"Jupiter Mission\" segment): \"Its origin and purpose still a total mystery.\" Reviewers McClay and Roger Ebert wrote that the monolith is the main element of mystery in the film; Ebert described \"the shock of the monolith's straight edges and square corners among the weathered rocks\", and the apes warily circling it as prefiguring man reaching \"for the stars\".[53] Patrick Webster suggests the final line relates to how the film should be approached as a whole: \"The line appends not merely to the discovery of the monolith on the Moon, but to our understanding of the film in the light of the ultimate questions it raises about the mystery of the universe.\"[211]\n\nAccording to other scholars, \"the monolith is a representation of the actual wideframe cinema screen, rotated 90 degrees ... a symbolic cinema screen\".[212] \"It is at once a screen and the opposite of a screen, since its black surface only absorbs, and sends nothing out. ... and leads us ... to project ourselves, our emotions.\"[213]\n\n### \"A new heaven\"\n\nClarke indicated his preferred reading of the ending of 2001 as oriented toward the creation of \"a new heaven\" provided by the Star Child.[197] His view was corroborated in a posthumously released interview with Kubrick.[47] Kubrick says that Bowman is elevated to a higher level of being that represents the next stage of human evolution. The film also conveys what some viewers have described as a sense of the sublime and numinous.[53] Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies:\n\nThe Star Child looking upon the Earth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorth's [rejected] score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action—to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.[53]\n\nIn a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how the quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a \"desire for the sublime\" characterised by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—\"something numinous\"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes us feel no longer \"lost in space\", but at home.[214] Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled \"Sense of Wonder\", describes how 2001 creates a \"numinous sense of wonder\" by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe but that at the same time we feel we can understand.[215] Christopher Palmer wrote that \"the sublime and the banal\" coexist in the film, as it implies that to get into space, people had to suspend the \"sense of wonder\" that motivated them to explore it.[216]\n\n### HAL's breakdown\n\nOne of HAL 9000's interfaces\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe reasons for HAL's malfunction and subsequent malignant behaviour have elicited much discussion. He has been compared to Frankenstein's monster. In Clarke's novel, HAL malfunctions because it has been ordered to lie to the crew of Discovery and withhold confidential information from them, namely the confidentially programmed mission priority over expendable human life, despite being constructed for \"the accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment\". This would not be addressed on film until the 1984 follow-up, 2010: The Year We Make Contact. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that HAL, as the supposedly perfect computer, is actually the most human of the characters.[53] In an interview with Joseph Gelmis in 1969, Kubrick said that HAL \"had an acute emotional crisis because he could not accept evidence of his own fallibility\".[217]\n\n### \"Star Child\" symbolism\n\nMultiple allegorical interpretations of 2001 have been proposed. The symbolism of life and death can be seen through the final moments of the film, which are defined by the image of the \"Star Child\", an in utero foetus that draws on the work of Lennart Nilsson.[218] The Star Child signifies a \"great new beginning\",[218] and is depicted naked and ungirded but with its eyes wide open.[219] Leonard F. Wheat sees 2001 as a multi-layered allegory, commenting simultaneously on Nietzsche, Homer, and the relationship of man to machine.[220] Rolling Stone reviewer Bob McClay sees the film as like a four-movement symphony, its story told with \"deliberate realism\".[221]\n\n### Military satellites\n\nKubrick originally planned a voice-over to reveal that the satellites seen after the prologue are nuclear weapons,[222] and that the Star Child would detonate the weapons at the end of the film[223] but felt this would create associations with Dr. Strangelove and decided not to make it obvious that they were \"war machines\". A few weeks before the film's release, the US and Soviet governments had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into outer space.[224] In a book he wrote with Kubrick's assistance, Alexander Walker states that Kubrick eventually decided that nuclear weapons had \"no place at all in the film's thematic development\", being an \"orbiting red herring\" that would \"merely have raised irrelevant questions to suggest this as a reality of the twenty-first century\".[222]\n\nKubrick scholar Michel Ciment, discussing Kubrick's attitude toward human aggression and instinct, observes: \"The bone cast into the air by the ape (now become a man) is transformed at the other extreme of civilization, by one of those abrupt ellipses characteristic of the director, into a spacecraft on its way to the moon.\"[225] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene \"other extreme of civilization\", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, says he sees it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that \"what we see is not how far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons. It's a continuation, not a discontinuity in that jump.\"[226]\n\n## Influence\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey is widely regarded as among the greatest and most influential films.[227] It is considered one of the major artistic works of the 20th century, with many critics and filmmakers considering it Kubrick's masterpiece.[228] In the 1980s,[229] critic David Denby compared Kubrick to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, calling him \"a force of supernatural intelligence, appearing at great intervals amid high-pitched shrieks, who gives the world a violent kick up the next rung of the evolutionary ladder\".[230] By the start of the 21st century, 2001: A Space Odyssey had become recognised as among the best films ever made by such sources as the British Film Institute (BFI). The Village Voice ranked the film at number 11 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.[231] In January 2002, the film was included on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics.[232][233] Sight &amp; Sound magazine ranked the film twelfth in its greatest films of all-time list in 1982,[234] tenth in 1992 critics' poll of greatest films,[235] sixth in the top ten films of all time in its 2002,[236] 2012[237] and 2022 critics' polls editions;[174] it also tied for second and first place in the magazine's 2012[237] and 2022 directors' poll.[174] The film was voted no. 43 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine Cahiers du cinéma in 2008.[238] In 2010, The Guardian named it \"the best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time\".[239] The film ranked 4th in BBC's 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.[240] In 1991, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.[241] In 2010, it was named the greatest film of all time by The Moving Arts Film Journal.[242]\n\nStanley Kubrick made the ultimate science fiction movie, and it is going to be very hard for someone to come along and make a better movie, as far as I'm concerned. On a technical level, it [Star Wars] can be compared, but personally I think that 2001 is far superior.\n\nThe influence of 2001 on subsequent filmmakers is considerable. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and others—including many special effects technicians—discuss the impact the film has had on them in a featurette titled Standing on the Shoulders of Kubrick: The Legacy of 2001, included in the 2007 DVD release of the film. Spielberg calls it his film generation's \"big bang\", while Lucas says it was \"hugely inspirational\", calling Kubrick \"the filmmaker's filmmaker\". Director Martin Scorsese has listed it as one of his favourite films of all time.[243] Sydney Pollack calls it \"groundbreaking\", and William Friedkin says 2001 is \"the grandfather of all such films\". At the 2007 Venice film festival, director Ridley Scott said he believed 2001 was the unbeatable film that in a sense killed the science fiction genre.[244] Similarly, film critic Michel Ciment in his essay \"Odyssey of Stanley Kubrick\" wrote, \"Kubrick has conceived a film which in one stroke has made the whole science fiction cinema obsolete.\"[245]\n\nOthers credit 2001 with opening up a market for films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, Blade Runner, Contact, and Interstellar, proving that big-budget \"serious\" science-fiction films can be commercially successful, and establishing the \"sci-fi blockbuster\" as a Hollywood staple.[246] Science magazine Discover's blogger Stephen Cass, discussing the film's considerable impact on subsequent science fiction, writes that \"the balletic spacecraft scenes set to sweeping classical music, the tarantula-soft tones of HAL 9000 and the ultimate alien artefact, the monolith, have all become enduring cultural icons in their own right.\"[247] Trumbull said that when working on Star Trek: The Motion Picture he made a scene without dialogue because of \"something I really learned with Kubrick and 2001: Stop talking for a while, and let it all flow\".[248]\n\nKubrick did not envision a sequel. Fearing the later exploitation and recycling of his material in other productions (as was done with the props from MGM's Forbidden Planet), he ordered all sets, props, miniatures, production blueprints, and prints of unused scenes destroyed.[249] Most of these materials were lost, with some exceptions: a 2001 spacesuit backpack appeared in the \"Close Up\" episode of the Gerry Anderson series UFO and one of HAL's eyepieces is in the possession of the author of Hal's Legacy, David G. Stork.[224][250][251][252] In March 2015, a model of the Aries 1B Trans-Lunar Space Shuttle used in the film was sold at auction for $344,000 in the United States.[253] In 2012, Lockheed engineer Adam Johnson, working with Frederick I. Ordway III, science adviser to Kubrick, wrote the book 2001: The Lost Science, which for the first time featured many of the blueprints of the spacecraft and film sets that previously had been thought destroyed. Clarke wrote three sequel novels: 2010: Odyssey Two (1982), 2061: Odyssey Three (1987), and 3001: The Final Odyssey (1997). The only filmed sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, released in 1984, was based on Clarke's 1982 novel. Kubrick was not involved; it was directed as a spin-off by Peter Hyams in a more conventional style. The other two novels have not been adapted for the screen, although actor Tom Hanks in June 1999 expressed a passing interest in possible adaptations.[254]\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the film's release, an exhibit called \"The Barmecide Feast\" opened on 8 April 2018, in the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. The exhibit features a fully realised, full-scale reflection of the neo-classical hotel room from the film's penultimate scene.[255][256] Director Christopher Nolan presented a 70 mm print of 2001 for the film's 50th anniversary at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on 12 May.[257][258] The new 70 mm print is a photochemical recreation made from the original camera negative, for the first time since the film's original theatrical run.[259][260] Further, an exhibit entitled \"Envisioning 2001: Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey\" presented at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, New York City opened in January 2020.[261]\n\nIn July 2020, a silver space suit was sold at auction in Los Angeles for $370,000, exceeding its estimate of $200,000–300,000. Four layers of paint indicate it was used in multiple scenes, including the Clavius Moon base sequence. The helmet had been painted green at one stage, leading to a belief that it may have been worn during the scene where Bowman disconnects HAL 9000.[262]\n\nStanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C. Clarke to Joseph Campbell's 1949 book The Hero with a Thousand Faces during the writing of 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are allegorical archetypal patterns of the \"hero's journey\" in this film. Clarke called Campbell's book \"very stimulating\" in a diary entry.[263]\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film has been released in numerous forms:\n\n- In 1980, MGM/CBS Home Video released the film on VHS and Betamax.[264]\n- In 1989, The Criterion Collection released a two-disc special LaserDisc edition with the transfer monitored by Kubrick himself.[265]\n- In 2008, Warner Home Video released the film on Blu-ray.[266]\n- In 2018, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment re-released it on Blu-ray and 4K HDR on Ultra HD Blu-ray, based on a 8K scan of the original camera negative and audio remixed and remastered in DTS-HD MA 5.1.[267]\n\n## Re-releases\n\nThe film was re-released in 1974, 1977, 1980[134] and 1993.[268] In 2001, a restoration of the 70 mm version was screened at the Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival, and the production was also reissued to selected film houses in North America, Europe and Asia.[269][270]\n\nFor the film's 50th anniversary, Warner Bros. struck new 70 mm prints from printing elements made directly from the original film negative.[259] This was done under the supervision of film director Christopher Nolan, who has spoken of 2001's influence on his career. Following a showing at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival introduced by Nolan, the film had a limited worldwide release at select 70 mm-equipped theatres in the summer of 2018,[257][271] followed by a one-week run in North American IMAX theatres (including five locations equipped with 70 mm IMAX projectors).[272]\n\nOn 3 December 2018, an 8K Ultra-high definition television version of the film was reported to have been broadcast in selected cinemas and shopping-mall demonstration stations in Japan.[273]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of artificial intelligence films\n- List of cult films\n- List of films considered the best\n- List of films featuring eclipses\n- List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n- List of films featuring space stations\n- List of incomplete or partially lost films\n- Voyage to the End of the Universe\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Jason Sperb's study of Kubrick The Kubrick Facade analyses Kubrick's use of narration in detail. John Baxter's biography of Kubrick also describes how he frequently favoured voice-over narration. Only three of Kubrick's 13 films lack narration: Space Odyssey, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut.[49]\n- ^ Examples of the Action Office desk and \"Propst Perch\" chair appearing in the film can be seen in Pina 2002, pp. 66–71.

The screenplay was written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. Its plot was inspired by several short stories optioned from Clarke, primarily \"The Sentinel\" (1951) and \"Encounter in the Dawn\" (1953). The film stars Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain. It follows a voyage by astronauts, scientists, and the sentient supercomputer HAL 9000 to Jupiter to investigate an alien monolith.\n    </PlotSummary>\n    <Themes>\n        The film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of spaceflight, pioneering special effects, and ambiguous themes.

In 1991, it was selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2022, 2001: A Space Odyssey placed in the top ten of Sight & Sound's decennial critics' poll, and topped their directors' poll. A sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, was released in 1984, based on the novel 2010: Odyssey Two. Clarke published a novelisation of 2001 (in part written concurrently with the screenplay) soon after the film's 1968 release, for which Kubrick received co-writing credit.\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<PlotSummary>\n    In a prehistoric veld, a tribe of hominins is driven away from a water hole by a rival tribe, and the next day finds an alien monolith. The tribe learns how to use a bone as a weapon and, after a first hunt, use it to drive the rival tribe away.\n</PlotSummary>\n\n<PlotSummary>\n    Millions of years later, Dr. Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the United States National Council of Astronautics, travels to Clavius Base, an American lunar outpost. During a stopover at Space Station Five, he meets Russian scientists who are concerned that Clavius seems to be unresponsive. He refuses to discuss rumours of an epidemic at the base. At Clavius, Floyd addresses a meeting of personnel to whom he stresses the need for secrecy regarding their newest discovery. His mission is to investigate a recently found artefact, a monolith buried four million years earlier near the lunar crater Tycho. As he and others examine and photograph the object, it emits a high-powered radio signal.\n</PlotSummary>\n\n<PlotSummary>\n    Eighteen months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter, with mission pilots and scientists Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole on board, along with three other scientists in suspended animation. Most of Discovery's operations are controlled by HAL, a HAL 9000 computer with a human-like personality. When HAL reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device, Bowman retrieves it in an extravehicular activity (EVA) pod, but finds nothing wrong. HAL suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be verified. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their backup 9000 computer indicate that HAL has made an error, but HAL blames it on human error. Concerned about HAL's behaviour, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod so they can talk in private without HAL overhearing. They agree to disconnect HAL if he is proven wrong. HAL follows their conversation by lip reading.\n</PlotSummary>\n\n<PlotSummary>\n    While Poole is floating away from his pod to replace the antenna unit, HAL takes control of the pod and attacks him, sending Poole tumbling away from the ship with a severed air line. Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole. While he is outside, HAL turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation, killing them. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, HAL refuses to let him back in, stating that their plan to deactivate him jeopardises the mission. Bowman releases Poole's body and opens the ship's emergency airlock with his remote manipulators. Lacking a helmet for his spacesuit, he positions his pod carefully so that when he jettisons the pod's door, he is propelled by the escaping air across the vacuum into Discovery's airlock. He enters HAL's processor core and begins disconnecting most of HAL's circuits, ignoring HAL's pleas to stop. When he is finished, a prerecorded video by Heywood Floyd plays, revealing that the mission's actual objective is to investigate the radio signal sent from the monolith to Jupiter.\n</PlotSummary>\n\n<PlotSummary>\n    At Jupiter, Bowman finds a third, much larger monolith orbiting the planet. He leaves Discovery in an EVA pod to investigate. He is pulled into a vortex of coloured light and observes bizarre astronomical phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colours as he passes by. Finally he finds himself in a large neoclassical bedroom where he sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself: first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a foetus enclosed in a transparent orb of light, which afterwards floats in space above the Earth.\n</PlotSummary>\n\n<Cast>\n    <Actor>Keir Dullea as Dr David Bowman</Actor>\n    <Actor>Gary Lockwood as Dr Frank Poole</Actor>\n    <Actor>William Sylvester as Dr Heywood Floyd</Actor>\n    <Actor>Daniel Richter as Moonwatcher, the chief man-ape</Actor>\n    <Actor>Leonard Rossiter as Dr Andrei Smyslov</Actor>\n    <Actor>Margaret Tyzack as Elena</Actor>\n    <Actor>Robert Beatty as Dr Ralph Halvorsen</Actor>\n    <Actor>Sean Sullivan as Dr Roy Michaels</Actor>\n    <Actor>Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL 9000</Actor>\n    <Actor>Frank Miller as mission controller</Actor>\n    <Actor>Edwina Carroll as lunar shuttle stewardess</Actor>\n    <Actor>Penny Brahms as stewardess</Actor>\n    <Actor>Heather Downham as stewardess</Actor>\n    <Actor>Alan Gifford as Poole's father</Actor>\n    <Actor>Ann Gillis as Poole's mother</Actor>\n    <Actor>Maggie d'Abo as stewardess (Space Station 5 elevator) (uncredited)</Actor>\n    <Actor>Chela Matthison as Mrs Turner, Space Station 5 reception (uncredited)</Actor>\n    <Actor>Vivian Kubrick as Floyd's daughter, \"Squirt\" (uncredited)</Actor>\n    <Actor>Kenneth Kendall as BBC announcer (uncredited)</Actor>\n</Cast>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    The film was polarising critics after its release, 2001: A Space Odyssey has since been subject to a variety of interpretations, ranging from the darkly apocalyptic to an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity.

Goldstein and starring Leslie Nielsen,[2][3] Ophélie Winter, Peter Egan,[4] and Ezio Greggio. The film has a few sequences satirizing elements of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but is not focused on parodying that film alone. Filming took place in Canada.\n\n## Plot\n\nMarshal Richard \"Dick\" Dix, a special detective, saves a fast food chain restaurant from a terrorist hostage situation, much to the displeasure of the police chief. He drives away and back to the police station, where he meets his boss, who is with a police worker, Cassandra Menage. She retells her experience of the cloning of the President of the United States of America, Bill Clinton, who remains unnamed throughout the film.\n\nDix is sent to the cloning facility, a Moon base called Vegan. He causes mayhem on the way there, reaches Vegan and is met by Lt. Bradford Shitzu at the security check. On the way to meet the main suspect in the cloning, Dr. Griffin Pratt, Dix experiences strange happenings throughout the colony involving certain Aliens who live there.\n\nDuring a very strange incident involving an Alien about to explode, Dix meets Capt. Valentino DiPasquale, with whom he will share his quarters. Dix and Shitzu get to Dr. Pratt's quarters, and talk to him. Shitzu leaves, and Pratt takes Dix on a tour of his cloning facility. While on the tour, he meets Dr. Uschi Künstler, with whom he takes the elevator to meet Ms. Menage. Dr. Künstler deserts the two, and they make their way to a party where the suspects may be.\n\nPratt and Menage have dinner, while Dix has a bizarre escapade with Pratt's toupe. He leaves the party and goes to his quarters with Valentino. There he shows him his huge array of disguises. Dix gets a phone call from Ms. Menage that they are about to raid Pratt's quarters. Dix destroys his Vegan model and spreads paint all over the place. Then he stumbles on the radio, and it starts playing the cancan very loudly.\n\nPratt comes back to his room, only to discover that Dix escaped. He goes to his apartment and threatens him. Dix tells Menage, and soon enough, Menage gets abducted by Pratt's goons. Pratt pretends to help Dix find the President and rescue Ms. Menage, but Pratt's goons trap them. Ms. Menage uses her martial arts skills, and the President, Dix, and Menage escape back to Earth. The President they rescued is then replaced with the president in the White House, and suddenly Dix finds out that he put the clone in the White House.\n\nThey find out that Dix's boss is also with Pratt. Dix, the President, Menage, Valentino, Shitzu and Künstler go to a concert by the Three Tenors, who are singing Village People songs. The presidents are involved in an onstage fight, and the whole concert is ruined by Shitzu's fumbling with the control panel. Then Künstler double-crosses Dix, and reveals she is actually an alien. After Menage kills her, the president is replaced, and Menage goes with Dix to a restaurant for a date.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Leslie Nielsen as Marshal \"Dick\" Dix\n- Ophélie Winter as Cassandra Menage\n- Peter Egan as Dr. Griffin Pratt\n- Damian Mason as Mr. President\n- Ezio Greggio as Capt. Valentino Di Pasquale\n- Pierre Edwards as Lt. Bradford Shitzu\n- Alexandra Kamp as Dr. Uschi Künstler\n- David Fox as Secretary Osgood\n- Michel Perron as Famous Tenor #1\n- Teresa Barnwell as Mrs. President\n\n## Production\n\nIn July 1998, it was announced German production company Helkon Media would be co-financing a Leslie Nielsen vehicle then titled Space Travesty 2000.[5]\n\n## Reception\n\nThe website Need Coffee praised Nielsen's comedy style, despite the film's silliness. \"If you're just in the mood for silly, puerile humor (and we all are, sometimes), or if you're under thirteen and the word 'penis' sends you into gails [sic] of laughter, then check this one out. Otherwise, skip it and check out something with a bit more sophistication.\"[6] Jason James from The Nut Gallery gave the film only one star out of five, stating: \"Overall I am not that big of a fan of spoof movies to begin with so it would have to be pretty special for me to like it. Even with that this is still not even that good of a spoof movie making it even harder to watch.\"[7] Richard Scheib from Moria.co also gave the film a very poor review, nominating it the \"Worst Film of 2001\".[8][9]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Pic, book pacts set for Helkon\".

The model and interior of the spaceship Discovery had to be constructed by painstakingly scrutinizing blown-up frames from the original movie. The reconstructed ship was not a complete copy: the corridors are just a bit wider and lit with a more natural blue/white tone compared to its '2001' counterpart.\n\n- GoofsNo pods should be in the pod bay in 2010. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) showed 3 pods. All were lost. The first was lost with Poole's body. The second was lost when Bowman blew the exploding bolts to enter the airlock. The third transported Bowman into the worm hole/monolith. When the crew enters the pod bay in 2010, one pod is is still sitting in it's storage area. (Although ignored in the movie, this is explained in the book (section 4, chapter 24). Dave Bowman is supposed to have retrieved pod #3 on remote while preparing his departure.) It is entirely possible that Bowen could have remotely piloted the pod back to the Discovery.\n\n- QuotesDr. Vasili Orlov: What was that all about?Chandra: I've erased all of HAL's memory from the moment the trouble started.Dr. Vasili Orlov: The 9000 series uses holographic memories, so chronological erasures would not work.Chandra: I made a tapeworm.Walter Curnow: You made a what?Chandra: It's a program that's fed into a system that will hunt down and destroy any desired memories.Dr. Heywood Floyd: Wait... do you know why HAL did what he did?Chandra: Yes. It wasn't his fault.Dr. Heywood Floyd: Whose fault was it?Chandra: Yours.Dr. Heywood Floyd: Mine?Chandra: Yours. In going through HAL's memory banks, I discovered his original orders. You wrote those orders. Discovery's mission to Jupiter was already in the advanced planning stages when the first small Monolith was found on the Moon, and sent its signal towards Jupiter. By direct presidential order, the existence of that Monolith was kept secret.Dr. Heywood Floyd: So?Chandra: So, as the function of the command crew - Bowman and Poole - was to get Discovery to its destination, it was decided that they should not be informed. The investigative team was trained separately, and placed in hibernation before the voyage began. Since HAL was capable of operating Discovery without human assistance, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in the event the crew was incapacitated or killed. He was given full knowledge of the true objective... and instructed not to reveal anything to Bowman or Poole. He was instructed to lie.Dr. Heywood Floyd: What are you talking about? I didn't authorize anyone to tell HAL about the Monolith!Chandra: Directive is NSC 342/23, top secret, January 30, 2001.Dr. Heywood Floyd: NSC... National Security Council, the White House.Chandra: I don't care who it is. The situation was in conflict with the basic purpose of HAL's design: The accurate processing of information without distortion or concealment. He became trapped. The technical term is an H. Moebius loop, which can happen in advanced computers with autonomous goal-seeking programs.Walter Curnow: The goddamn White House.Dr. Heywood Floyd: I don't believe it.Chandra: HAL was told to lie... by people who find it easy to lie. HAL doesn't know how, so he couldn't function. He became paranoid.Dr. Heywood Floyd: Those sons of bitches. I didn't know. I didn't know!\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Late Night with Johnny Carson: Buddy Hackett/John Lithgow (1984)\n\n- SoundtracksAlso Sprach Zarathustra!\nBy Richard Strauss\n\n### User reviews318\n\nFeatured review\n\n### A much different movie than the first one.\n\nThe first movie in the series, 2001, was a very artistic piece that had only moments of dialogue in its more than two hours of film.  2010 appears nearly apologetic in comparison, explicating somewhat excruciatingly every nuance of the plot through the main character's supposed messages back to planet earth.  All of the blurry details of 2001 are made crystal clear in this fashion.  It is a very wordy movie.\n\nNevertheless, 2010 has images that can captivate audiences just as well as they did in 1984.  Today's movie goers will notice slight glitches in the special effects as well as a couple of discontinuities.  The movie also dates itself because the plot includes a lot of tension between the Americans and Russians.\n\nBecause 2001 was such a great movie, 2010 tends to pale in comparison. However, it is still a very good science fiction movie and it is worth viewing (but probably not buying).\n\n- tzzertao\n- Nov 15, 1999\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ28\n\n- How long is 2010: The Year We Make Contact?Powered by Alexa\n- What was the source of the chlorophyll on Europa?\n- Why didn't William Sylvester reprise his role as Dr. Floyd?\n- Why didn't Leonov just bring enough fuel on board so they wouldn't have to slingshot?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - April 4, 1985 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Official Facebook\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Russian\n- Also known as\n    - 2010: El año que hacemos contacto\n- Filming locations\n    - Very Large Array, Socorro, New Mexico, USA\n- Production company\n    - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $28,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $40,400,657\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $7,393,361\n    - Dec 9, 1984\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $40,400,657\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 56 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nBy what name was 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984) officially released in India in Hindi?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Defining moments in movies, defining teenage angst, growing pains and young love and loves lost. Films that stand up today, not just for nostalgia's sake but because of solid acting, amazing characters and good stories.\n\nI despair for the drivel that our millennial's have to endure today in the name of cinema. If you've grown up on good films through the years then you want to avoid The Fifth Wave. Encourage your young-lings to watch something else.\n\nChloe maybe a good actress, but she couldn't drag the film from the mire of this cliché driven plot line with shallow characters and an awfully banal story of an alien plot to take over the Earth in as seemingly clueless manner as possible.\n\n- quothage\n- Aug 10, 2016\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is The 5th Wave?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - January 14, 2016 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United Kingdom\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official Instagram\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - La Quinta Ola\n- Filming locations\n    - Macon, Georgia, USA(Cotton Ave: bus explosion)\n- Production companies\n    - Columbia Pictures\n    - LStar Capital\n    - Material Pictures\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $38,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $34,916,787\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $10,326,356\n    - Jan 24, 2016\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $109,906,372\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 52 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - Datasat\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It would have been better had a bit more money were spent, upgrading the production.  Still, the comedy is classic Abbott &amp; Costello, and the beauty queens are lovely to look at, a preposition!  I used to be a professional photographer, so beauty is good to behold.  I gave this a good 6, wish it could be higher.\n\n- Grok-Huy\n- Oct 3, 1999\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ15\n\n- How long is Abbott and Costello Go to Mars?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - December 11, 1953 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Abbott und Costello - Mit der Rakete zur Venus\n- Filming locations\n    - Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA(Studio)\n- Production company\n    - Universal International Pictures (UI)\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $754,000 (estimated)\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 17 minutes\n- Color\n    - Black and White\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.37 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nBy what name was Abbott and Costello Go to Mars (1953) officially released in India in English?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There he is placed under the supervision of lab worker Lester to help load supplies onto an experimental rocket ship. While on board with Lester, Orville flips the ignition switch and the rocket ship blasts off, flying across the country and eventually landing outside of New Orleans, where Mardi Gras is in progress. Lester and Orville, believing that they have successfully landed on Mars, don spacesuits and go into the city, where they assume the grotesquely costumed celebrants are Martians, while the others assume they are fellow costumed celebrants. Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse and Mugsy, stumble upon the rocket ship, put on spacesuits and head to New Orleans to rob a bank and steal clothes. Lester and Orville are wrongly accused of the crimes and flee back to the rocket ship, where Mugsy and Harry force them to launch and demand to actually go to Mars. However, once in outer space, Lester and Orville get control of the crooks' gun and attempt to land back on Earth. The ship instead lands on Venus, where the four men are quickly captured by female guards and brought to the ruler of the planet, Queen Allura. She informs them that Venus is inhabited only by women because men were banished long ago. She takes more than a liking to Orville and makes him her king consort on the condition that he remains true to her. Orville agrees, and has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned. However, Mugsy convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove to Queen Allura that he cannot be trusted. Disillusioned with Orville, the Queen orders all the men to leave Venus. Upon returning to the Earth, the men are lauded as heroes in a parade, but Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a spaceship to Earth to drop a cake on Orville's head.",

For starters, it’s called Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe.\n\nNathan Rabin's Bad Ideas is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nI chuckle just looking at that fun series of words and the word “Abraxas” in particular. It’s just fun! To paraphrase The Sound of Music, it’s all the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word. Say it soft and it’s almost like praying.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbraxas!\n\nAbraxas!\n\nAbraxas!\n\nI’ve derived joy from the word Abraxas long before I watched Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe because I am a big fan of the We Love Movies podcast and its hosts never tire of yelling those words in Jesse Ventura’s deeply imitable upper Midwestern accent.\n\nYou know what other word is fun to say? Secundus.\n\nGo ahead, say it. Fun, huh?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstead of making a surreally terrible, low-budget knock-off of The Terminator with a title just begging for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment Arnold made an actual Terminator movie that ranks as one of the greatest sequels and science fiction movies of all time.\n\nI think he made the right choice.\n\nThe only possible thing that could have attracted Schwarzenegger to material this dodgy would be an opportunity to work with his good friend and colleague Sven Olse-Thorsen, whom he had previously collaborated with on Conan the Barbarian, Conan the Destroyer, Red Sonja, Raw Deal, Predator, Running Man, Red Heat, Twins and Total Recall.\n\nOlse-Thorsen might have hoped that he and his somewhat more successful contemporary were a package deal, and that where one went the other followed. That did not prove to be the case with Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe, however.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstead of landing one of the biggest movie stars in the world for a low-budget Terminator knockoff Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe scored a substantially cheaper Predator star in wrestler turned actor turned politician Jesse “The Body” Ventura.\n\nVentura plays the title character, ABRAXAS! ABRAXAS! Sorry, I can’t help it. I’m just in love with the name Abraxas.\n\nAbraxas is a “Minder”, a space cop from the planet Sargacia who has been on the job for about ten thousand years. He was once space-partners with fellow Minder Secundus (Sven-Ole Thorsen) until SECUNDUS went rogue and started pursuing an Anti-Life Equation he believes will render him all-powerful as well as immortal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWriter-director Damian Lee essentially stole the concept of the Anti-Life Equation from Jack Kirby and his Fourth World universe. EVERYBODY stole from Jack Kirby. No one pilfered quite as ineptly as Abraxas, however.\n\nThat isn’t the only idea Lee stole from Kirby, however. The Minders have small, super powerful, seemingly sentient computer helpers that are essentially the Mother Boxes by another name.\n\nAbraxas borrows equally from Jack Kirby and James Cameron, with a little Rambo thrown in for good measure. Yet all of these respectable influences resulted in something hilariously incompetent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn his eternal search for the solution to the Anti-Life Equation Secundus travels to an obscure planet called Earth, where he impregnates an Earth human named Sonia Murray (Marjorie Bransfield) just by placing his hand on her belly.\n\nA few minutes later she gives birth to a boy she names Tommy (Francis Mitchell) who is mute and possesses telekinetic powers. Tommy is the Culmator, a super-powerful being able to solve the all-important Anti-Matter Equation.\n\nWhen Sonia tries to explain to her parents that she does not know who the father of her son is because she’d never seen him before and they didn’t even have sex, or even kiss, they understandably do not believe her. I will be the first to concede that her explanation seems a little far-fetched and hard to believe, particularly the part about experiencing the evil space version of a virgin birth. So they kick her and her offspring out of the house.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJames Belushi, who was married to Bransfield when Abraxas was made, contributes a cameo as Principal Rick Latimer, his character from The Principal that is either brilliant or incredibly stupid.\n\nIn it, the Principal warns Sonya that her son is being bullied at school. He says that kids are making fun of him, and calling him names, and pushing him, and beating him up and that it is a problem.\n\nSonya asks the Principal why he doesn’t just ask the other kindergartners to stop terrorizing her son and he replies, with hilariously clueless earnestness, that he hadn’t thought about it but he definitely would ASK HIS STUDENTS TO STOP ABUSING the mute five year old with telekinetic powers in their midst.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbraxas’ space bosses order him to kill Sonia before she can give birth but he cannot murder an innocent woman, even if doing so might save the universe. He’s a big softie, or at least he’s extremely large.\n\nAbraxas: Guardian of the Universe is one of those adorable science-fiction movies that try to tell an epic story that spans galaxies and worlds with less than no money and nothing in the way of resources.\n\nAbraxas’ conception of an alien command center, consequently, is a dimly lit room with a bunch of random lights blinking on and off in the background. Its idea of alien warfare, meanwhile, entails having two exceedingly large men chase one another through the white, dispiriting, Arctic Canadian winter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe hero and villain both have strong accents that make them all wrong for science fiction unless you assume that Thorsen is from the Swedish part of Sargacia while Ventura is from its answer to Minnesota.\n\nThis low-budget, low-energy, low-ambition vision of intergalactic warfare takes place not in the farthest reaches of space but rather in a sleepy small town not unlike the one Rambo visits/destroys in First Blood.\n\nAbraxas could have ended the threat Secundus represents by killing the mother of his child but he has a moral code that will not allow him to do something like that. Instead of killing the terrified single mother, and eliminating the threat within her womb, he instead acts as her protector against his partner-turned-enemy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTommy is a weird kid who is able to make a bully piss himself using only his mind, a nifty party trick for the first grade and under crowd. Tommy has just about the worst deadbeat dad in the universe but he has an unusual father figure in Abraxas.\n\nThis mirrors Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator acting as a protector to Sarah Conner and her juvenile delinquent offspring in T2: Judgment Day, which actually came out a few months after Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe.\n\nThe big difference is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a goddamn movie star. Arnold possesses qualities such as handsomeness, charm, charisma, humor, magnetism, presence, a light touch and likability that Ventura does not have.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOh sweet lord is Jesse Ventura not a movie star. It took actually starring in a movie that barely qualifies as a movie to make that screamingly apparent. He doesn’t have the looks. He doesn’t have the charisma. He doesn’t have the voice. He just plain doesn’t have it.\n\nVentura is a remarkable human being who can be very entertaining and colorful in other contexts and is perfectly suited to playing supporting roles in movies like The Running Man and Predator.\n\nBut Ventura is not a leading man. Neither is Thorsen.

He was once space-partners with fellow Minder Secundus (Sven-Ole Thorsen) until Secundus went rogue and started pursuing an Anti-Life Equation he believes will render him all-powerful as well as immortal. Secundus travels to Earth, where he impregnates an Earth human named Sonia Murray (Marjorie Bransfield) just by placing his hand on her belly. A few minutes later she gives birth to a boy she names Tommy (Francis Mitchell) who is mute and possesses telekinetic powers. Tommy is the Culmator, a super-powerful being able to solve the all-important Anti-Matter Equation.\n    </Plot Summary>\n    <Themes>\n        The film explores themes of morality, protection, and the struggle between good and evil, as Abraxas must protect Sonia and her child from Secundus.\n    </Themes>\n    <Intensity Level>Low</Intensity Level>\n    <Space Setting>Yes</Space Setting>\n</Additional Information>\n\nAccording to the trivia section of The Internet Movie Database, Arnold Schwarzenegger was offered the lead role in 1990’s <Name>Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe</Name>, but turned it down to make <Name>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</Name> instead. \n\nI can’t imagine Schwarzenegger even contemplating making <Name>Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe</Name> for as long as a millisecond. For starters, it’s called <Name>Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe</Name>.\n\nI chuckle just looking at that fun series of words and the word “Abraxas” in particular. It’s just fun! To paraphrase The Sound of Music, it’s all the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word. Say it soft and it’s almost like praying.\n\nInstead of making a surreally terrible, low-budget knock-off of <Name>The Terminator</Name> with a title just begging for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment, Arnold made an actual <Name>Terminator</Name> movie that ranks as one of the greatest sequels and science fiction movies of all time. I think he made the right choice.\n\nInstead of landing one of the biggest movie stars in the world for a low-budget Terminator knockoff, <Name>Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe</Name> scored a substantially cheaper Predator star in wrestler turned actor turned politician Jesse “The Body” Ventura. Ventura plays the title character, ABRAXAS! ABRAXAS! Sorry, I can’t help it. I’m just in love with the name Abraxas.\n\nWriter-director <Director>Damian Lee</Director> essentially stole the concept of the Anti-Life Equation from Jack Kirby and his Fourth World universe. Abraxas borrows equally from Jack Kirby and James Cameron, with a little Rambo thrown in for good measure. Yet all of these respectable influences resulted in something hilariously incompetent.\n\nJames Belushi, who was married to Bransfield when <Name>Abraxas</Name> was made, contributes a cameo as Principal Rick Latimer, his character from <Name>The Principal</Name> that is either brilliant or incredibly stupid. \n\nAbraxas’ space bosses order him to kill Sonia before she can give birth, but he cannot murder an innocent woman, even if doing so might save the universe. He’s a big softie, or at least he’s extremely large.\n\n<Name>Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe</Name> is one of those adorable science-fiction movies that try to tell an epic story that spans galaxies and worlds with less than no money and nothing in the way of resources. \n\nThe hero and villain both have strong accents that make them all wrong for science fiction unless you assume that Thorsen is from the Swedish part of Sargacia while Ventura is from its answer to Minnesota. \n\nLate in the film, Secundus has an opportunity to kill his rival but instead graciously lets him live so that he can witness him taking over the world. That is very gracious of him but in a shocking turn of events, it backfires when Abraxas kills him.\n\nAbraxas decides that he likes Earth and would like to stay around for a while so he ignores orders to return to his home planet. To fit in better, I’d like to think that Abraxas changed his name to something less alien, like Bob or Billy or Butch.\n\nVentura’s ill-fated vehicle is legendary in bad movie circles for a very good reason: it delivers the goods. It’s a kooky campy cult classic for the ages with a lead performance that is unforgettable in all the wrong ways. It is truly a movie that lives up to the title <Name>Abraxas: Guardian of the Universe</Name>. Or down to its title, depending on your perspective.\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the relevant attributes of the movie while maintaining the original meaning and flow of the article.

Obviously, in reality this dish was pointing towards Earth at all times, which would not be in the direction of travel by the time of the Saturn encounter.\n\n- QuotesNeil Clarke: I can do ANYTHING! Okay... bu... but... what do I *really* want?[Looks down and laughs] Neil Clarke: GIVE ME A REALLY BIG DICK![Falls over] Neil Clarke: Augh! ouch! NOT *THAT* BIG! Obviously! Dick, return to your old size![Gets up] Neil Clarke: Agh! Ah... Ok. Um... Let me have a penis that women find exciting![Looks down] Neil Clarke: Yeah, it's good, yeah. Could I have it white?\n\n- Crazy creditsDuring the credits, pictures of the film's story board are shown, as well as clips of Robin Williams recording a few of his lines.\n\n- Alternate versionsThe UK release was cut, this film was originally seen for advice. The distributor was advised the likely classification was 15 but that their preferred 12A could be obtained by reducing the quantity of strong language. When the film was submitted for formal classification, the number of uses of strong language had been reduced and the film was therefore classified 12A.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Kylie Minogue: Absolutely Anything and Anything at All (2015)\n\n- SoundtracksAbsolutely Anything\nWritten and performed by Roger Taylor\nRecorded and mixed by Joshua Macrae (as Joshua J Macrae)\nLicensed courtesy of Nightjar Productions Limited\nPublished by EMI MUSIC PUBLISHING\n\n### User reviews154\n\nFeatured review\n\n### A simple, silly, but funny and enjoyable family movie.\n\nWhat should I start with ? Oh, yes, I don't really get the mediocre score and reviews for this movie. Yeah, it's not another Holymollywood show (thank heavens!), it's not amazing in any way, but it does great at being a simple, enjoyable and funny movie to watch with your family. Both Simon Pegg and Kate are lovely to watch here. \n\nYou can just sit, relax and have a fun time. It clearly doesn't try to be smart or serious, people should understand this. There's also a tiny but nice message in it, that once understood, makes a better image of it all. If you enjoyed \"Hector and the search for happiness\", you should give this one a try.

When Bud drags Lindsey back to the rig, that's really Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio holding her breath. When the rig is being flooded and characters are running from water, drowning behind closed doors, and dodging exploding parts of the rig, those are all actors, not stunt people.\n\n- GoofsWhen the divers are swimming, you can see bubbles with every breath, meaning that they are on an open-system (i.e. scuba). However at that depth (2000ft), a standard scuba tank would be exhausted in under two minutes, or much less with any kind of exertion.\n\n- QuotesLindsey Brigman: We all see what we want to see. Coffey looks and he sees Russians. He sees hate and fear. You have to look with better eyes than that.\n\n- Crazy creditsIn the cast list, Super Seal Rover is credited as Big Geek and Mini Rover\nMk II is credited as Little Geek. These are the actual models used for the\nunmanned submarines.\n\n- Alternate versionsThe end credits were famously shortened to run under 5 minutes in 1989 in order to hit a target runtime and maximize daily showings; doing so also made the crawl almost illegibly tiny and fast. The credits on the extended edition were almost 10 minutes, with a bigger and slower crawl, and extended/alternate music. Several home video releases of the theatrical edition on laserdisc and DVD actually use the newer credits, so they are not entirely faithful! One VHS tape (Fox Video Selections 1561), at least, uses the original short credits; though the tape is formatted for 4:3, the credits merely gain picture information above and below the intended window (which, for some reason, is very high up in the frame after the first few names). However the new HD master, which has popped up on a few HDTV broadcasts (like Cinemax) go back to the original shortened credits, plus is in the original theatrical aspect ratio, making it the most faithful version available.\n\n- ConnectionsEdited into No Feat But What We Make: 'Terminator 2' and the Rise of Digital Effects (2003)\n\n- SoundtracksWilling\nWritten by Lowell George\nPerformed by Linda Ronstadt\nCourtesy of CEMA Special Markets and Capitol Records, Inc.\n\n### User reviews547\n\nFeatured review\n\n### An excellent movie\n\nThis movie is extremely well made.  Make sure you get the original director's cut, or Special Edition as they are calling it on the DVD.  It includes the real ending, along with more than 20 minutes of additional footage.  The morons from the studio in Hollywood decided that the public wouldn't want to see a nearly 3-hour underwater adventure, and forced James Cameron to cut it down and change the ending.  The ending the studios insisted on is your typical boring old done-a-million-times happy ending, and does not work.  It betrays the message of the film, and makes it nothing more than a good underwater shoot-em-up.  This movie is much more than that. See the REAL ending to understand why it is so important to this film.  As opposed to the canned studio ending, the REAL one makes you think.  Well, what did you expect?  Hollywood executives make movies for the common herd, they dumb them down to make sure every patron goes away feeling happy.  God forbid that anyone actually may have to think a little.  At the time, despite a few solid hits (such as the original Terminator), James Cameron wasn't enough of a power in La-La land to force the studios to release the movie as he wanted it to be.  After Titanic, they will do whatever he says, so we can now expect some great Cameron films to look forward to, rather than having to wait for the REAL movie to come out years later on a Special Edition DVD.\n\n- Rooster99\n- Dec 28, 2001\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ29\n\n- How long is The Abyss?Powered by Alexa\n- Is this available on blu-ray?\n- Where does the story take place?\n- What is \"The Abyss\" about?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - December 14, 1989 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - El secreto del abismo\n- Filming locations\n    - Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant, Gaffney, South Carolina, USA(two tanks - underwater scenes)\n- Production companies\n    - Twentieth Century Fox\n    - Pacific Western\n    - Lightstorm Entertainment\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $70,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $54,981,151\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $9,319,797\n    - Aug 13, 1989\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $90,520,202\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 20 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of The Abyss (1989) in Canada?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

During this period, the United States was seeking to establish a coherent national identity and the works of Washington Irving—\"Sleepy Hollow\" included—helped put the young nation on the literary map.\n\nThe story takes place in a Dutch settlement called Tarry Town, a small market town on the shore of the Hudson River. Irving based this community on Tarrytown, New York, a village located in present-day Westchester County. A few miles from Tarry Town is Sleepy Hollow, a “sequestered glen” that seems to exist partially outside of time. The hustle and bustle of nearby cities is conspicuously absent from Sleepy Hollow, where the fashions hardly ever change and the residents exist in a state of perpetual repose. Sleepy Hollow’s atmosphere has a “drowsy, dreamy influence” on the area’s inhabitants, who are uniquely prone to superstitions, ghost stories, and supernatural visions. The most popular of these superstitions is the Headless Horseman, who Sleepy Hollow residents believe is the ghost of a Hessian trooper from the Revolutionary War.\n\nWithin Sleepy Hollow, the schoolhouse is a key setting that reveals unflattering elements of Ichabod Crane’s personality. Crane uses corporal punishment on his students while simultaneously ingratiating himself with their parents in hopes of getting hot meals and temporary lodging. He is authoritarian to people younger and weaker than he is, but around adults, he is slimy and ingratiating.\n\nAnother significant setting is the Van Tassel mansion, home to the wealthy Dutch farmer Baltus Van Tassel and his daughter, Katrina. When Ichabod visits the mansion, he is enraptured by Van Tassel’s abundant fields, well-fed animals, and beautiful grounds. At the sight of so much prosperity, Ichabod’s “devouring mind’s eye” begins to fantasize about claiming these riches for himself by marrying Katrina. This setting reveals Ichabod’s limitless appetite for fine food, beautiful women, and the prestige that accompanies great wealth.\n\nThe postscript to \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" takes place in a new, unexpected setting. Diedrich Knickerbocker, the story’s narrator, relates how he heard the story of Ichabod Crane at “a Corporation meeting of the ancient city of Manhattoes” – Manhattoes refers to the southern tip of Manhattan island during the period of Dutch colonization. In the postscript, Knickerbocker explains that the original storyteller didn’t believe the story himself and only told it to entertain a group of Dutch businessmen. The setting of the Corporation meeting puts \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" in a social context that casts doubt on Knickerbocker’s claim that his story is “precise and authentic.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrevious\n\nPersonification\n\nPrevious\n\nPersonification\n\nNext\n\nStyle\n\nNext\n\nStyle\n\n####\n\nCompany\n\nSupport\n\nConnect\n\nLegal\n\nCopyright © 2025 All Rights Reserved\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSave time.

Based on the Stephen King's 1980 novella of the same name, the film stars an ensemble cast including Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, Andre Braugher and Toby Jones.\n\nThe plot follows a group of people in the small town of Bridgton, Maine, who become trapped inside a supermarket after a mysterious mist envelops the town, concealing deadly, Lovecraftian creatures. As fear and paranoia spread, tensions rise among the survivors. While the film is primarily a monster movie, it explores how ordinary people react under extreme circumstances. Darabont notably altered the novella's ending, a change that King supported.\n\nThe Mist was filmed in Shreveport, Louisiana, beginning in February 2007, and was released in the United States on November 21, 2007, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Dimension Films. The film received polarizing reviews from critics, and grossed over $57 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nA severe thunderstorm strikes Bridgton, Maine, causing a tree to crash through the lakeside home of artist David Drayton, his wife Stephanie, and their eight-year-old son, Billy. The next morning, David, Billy, and their neighbor Brent Norton head to town for supplies, unaware that a mysterious mist is descending on the area. Along the way, they pass several military convoys.\n\nOnce inside the supermarket, the mist envelops the town, trapping everyone inside. Dan Miller, a local resident, bursts into the store, warning of unseen dangers in the mist. Soon after, bagger Norm attempts to fix the store's generator but is attacked by a tentacled creature. The survivors begin barricading the store while religious fanatic Mrs. Carmody preaches that the mist is divine punishment. Brent, skeptical of the danger, leaves the store with a group of people, never to return.\n\nDavid and a few others, including teachers Amanda Dunfrey and Irene Reppler, try to maintain order. However, chaos ensues when giant flying insects and pterodactyl-like creatures break through the windows, killing several people. Mrs. Carmody narrowly survives the insect attack while praying. As a result, she gains more followers, capitalizing on the fear and despair among the survivors.\n\nA group led by David ventures to a nearby pharmacy in search of medical supplies but is attacked by deadly spider-like creatures. Upon their return, tensions rise as Mrs. Carmody calls for sacrifices to appease the monsters, singling out a soldier named Jessup, who reveals that the mist was the result of a military experiment to find other worlds gone wrong. He is thrown outside and immediately killed by a monstrous creature.\n\nThe next morning, as Mrs. Carmody demands Billy be sacrificed, assistant manager Ollie shoots and kills her, allowing David and his group to escape the store. After Ollie is killed by a creature, the others grab his gun and drive off. The group stops by David's house, where they see Stephanie's dead body. As the group continue their drive through the mist, they pass scenes of widespread destruction and come across a colossal creature before eventually running out of gas.\n\nWith no hope left, David mercy-kills the group with the last four bullets, including Billy. David steps out of the vehicle and screams for the monsters to come and kill him. The mist begins to clear, as the U.S. Army arrives soon after to exterminate the creatures and rescue survivors. Realizing his actions were in vain, a distraught David collapses, screaming in anguish.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Thomas Jane as David Drayton, a painter who ends up trapped in the supermarket with his son Billy\n- Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody, a religious fanatic who believes the mist to be the wrath of God\n- Laurie Holden as Amanda Dunfrey, a new teacher at the local school.

Darabont devised a new, darker ending for the film, which King praised for its boldness, and acknowledged that the new ending was a stark departure from more conventional, feel-good conclusions often expected by studios, remarking, \"The ending is such a jolt—wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending.\"[12]\n\nDarabont viewed The Mist as a throwback to classic storytelling, referencing writers like Paddy Chayefsky and comparing the film's themes to Lord of the Flies, where fear drives people to behave primitively. He emphasized the film’s exploration of human behavior under duress, explaining that it was about \"people at each other\" more than the monsters themselves. Darabont also cited influences such as The Twilight Zone episode \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\" and the film Lifeboat (1944).[4]\n\nIn adapting the novella, Darabont altered some character dynamics. For instance, the novella includes a brief extramarital affair between the characters David Drayton and Amanda Dumfries, but Darabont chose to instead create a more emotional, surrogate family dynamic between them in the film. Jane, who played David, noted that his character and Amanda (Laurie Holden) become a \"little unit\" in the face of the horrors they endure together, a relationship Holden compared to the bonds formed by survivors at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.[13]\n\nThe film also elaborates on the origins of the mist, which is left vague in the novella. Darabont introduced an explanation involving the Arrowhead Project, a military experiment that opened portals to other dimensions.[14] Though Darabont wrote an unfilmed opening scene depicting a malfunction at the project’s lab, the film still provides more context about the mist's origins than King's original story.\n\n### Production\n\nIn December 2006, Jane finalized his role in The Mist, joining the cast as Drayton.[15] By January 2007, additional actors such as Holden and Andre Braugher were also confirmed for key roles.[16] Filming began in February 2007 at StageWorks of Louisiana in Shreveport, Louisiana, marking the start of the production.[17][18] Later that month, Marcia Gay Harden and Toby Jones joined the ensemble cast.[19]\n\nVeteran actors William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Brian Libby, all of whom had previously worked with director Darabont on The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, were cast in supporting roles. Interestingly, Sadler had voiced the character of David Drayton in a 1986 audiobook version of The Mist. Darabont initially wanted King to appear in a supporting role, but he declined the offer.[19]\n\nDarabont sought a \"fluid, ragged documentary\" style for the film, drawing inspiration from his experience directing The Shield. To achieve this, he enlisted the same camera crew to bring a gritty, realistic feel to the movie.[13][20] Although Darabont considered shooting The Mist digitally, he ultimately chose to film on 400 ASA Fujifilm to give it a grainy texture, adding to the atmospheric tension.[4]\n\nNotably, the film includes a nod to King’s The Dark Tower series, with David Drayton seen painting an image based on the books in the opening scene. This artwork was created by renowned poster designer Drew Struzan, whose work also appears in the form of posters for films like The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.[21]\n\nDarabont worked closely with the production design team to blend multiple eras within the film’s aesthetic, avoiding an overtly modern or period-specific feel. This mix is evident in details like characters using cell phones, while military personnel are shown driving older Jeeps instead of modern Humvees. The setting of the small-town supermarket was filmed in Vivian, Louisiana, while the fire trucks in the early scenes were from the local Caddo Parish fire department, adding a distinct local flavor to the film.[4]\n\nAround 100 extras from the Shreveport area were used, with 60 of them intricately interwoven into scenes with the main cast to create a more immersive, populated environment.[22] Local Louisiana brands, such as Zapp's potato chips, were featured as part of the film's effort to ground its setting in a recognizable location.[12]\n\n### Music\n\nDarabont chose to use music to minimal effect in The Mist to capture the \"heavier feel\" of the darker ending he had written to replace the one from the novella. The director explained, \"Sometimes movie music feels false. I've always felt that silent can be scarier than loud, a whisper more frightening than a bang, and we wanted to create a balance. We kept music to a minimum to keep that vérité, documentary feel.\" Darabont chose to overlay the song \"Host of Seraphim\" by the band Dead Can Dance, a spiritual piece characterized by wailing and chanting. As a fan of Dead Can Dance, Darabont thought that the song played \"as a requiem mass for the human race.\"[23] The original score was composed by Academy Award-nominated composer Mark Isham.\n\n### Effects\n\nDarabont hired artists Jordu Schell[24] and Bernie Wrightson to assist in designing the creatures for the film.[20] Greg Nicotero worked on the film's creature design and make-up effects, while Everett Burrell served as the visual effects supervisor. Nicotero initially sketched out ideas for creature design when Darabont originally expressed interest in filming The Mist in the 1980s. When the project was greenlit, Nicotero, Burrell, and Darabont collaborated on the creature design at round-table meetings at CaféFX.[13] The studio for visual effects had been recommended to Darabont by Guillermo del Toro after Darabont asked the director who created the visual effects for Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nBecause the creatures were described in only a few sentences in the novella, Darabont sought to create new designs, but specifically designs which felt unique. Nicotero, who was versed in film and genre history, reviewed past creature designs to avoid duplicating earlier screen monsters.[4] When the designs were completed, Nicotero and Burrell educated the cast on the appearance of the creatures by showing them puppets and the function of their eyes and mouths. The puppet demonstrations served as reference points for the cast, who had to respond to motion-capture dots during filming.[13]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Mist was screened at the film festival ShowEast on October 18, 2007, at which Darabont received the Kodak Award for Excellence in Filmmaking for his previous works The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.[25]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Mist was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 25, 2008. Lionsgate Home Entertainment later released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 3, 2023. The DVD and Blu-ray Special Editions also included Darabont's black and white version of the film, which fans believe to be a superior version.[26]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Mist was commercially released in the United States and Canada on November 21, 2007.[3] Over its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,931,973 across both regions. By August 9, 2009, the film had grossed $25,593,755 in the United States and Canada, with an additional $27,560,960 from international markets, bringing its worldwide total to $57,289,103.[3]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Mist holds a 71% approval rating based on 147 reviews, with an average score of 6.60/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Frank Darabont's impressive camerawork and politically incisive script make The Mist a truly frightening experience.\"[27] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58/100 based on 29 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[28] CinemaScore audiences, however, gave it a less favorable \"C\" rating, on a scale of A to F.[29]\n\nCritics were divided in their assessments. James Berardinelli praised the film, calling it \"dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore,\" adding that it finally did justice to a Stephen King horror adaptation. He described it as a \"must-see\" for fans of the genre.[30] Michael Phillips from the Chicago Tribune echoed this sentiment, labeling it \"good and creepy,\" while Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly commended Harden's performance as Mrs. Carmody, calling it \"brilliant.\"[31][32]\n\nIn contrast, Roger Ebert gave the film a more lukewarm review, rating it 2 stars out of 4. He noted that while it was a \"competently made Horrible Things Pouncing on People movie,\" it didn't live up to Darabont's past works like The Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile.[33] Justin Chang of Variety also had mixed feelings, stating that while The Mist worked as a \"gross-out B-movie,\" it fell short in its psychological depth due to \"one-note characterizations\" and an inconsistent tone.[34]\n\nDespite these criticisms, the film has been retrospectively appreciated by some, with Tom Ambrose of Empire calling it \"criminally overlooked\" and one of the best horror films of recent years.[35]\n\n### Accolades\n\nBloody Disgusting ranked the film #4 on their list of the \"Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade\", with the article saying: \"The scary stuff works extremely well, but what really drives this one home is Darabont's focus on the divide that forms between two factions of the townspeople—the paranoid, Bible-thumping types and the more rational-minded, decidedly left-wing members of the populace. This allegorical microcosm of G. W. Bush-era America is spot on, and elevates an already-excellent film to even greater heights.\"[36]\n\nAt the 34th Saturn Awards, The Mist received nominations for Best Horror Film and Best Director (Darabont), with Harden winning Best Supporting Actress.[37]\n\n## TV series\n\nIn November 2013, Bob Weinstein revealed that Darabont and he were developing a 10-part television series based on the film.[38][39] In February 2016, Spike picked up the pilot.[40] In April 2016, Spike ordered the series,[41] and Adam Bernstein directed the pilot, which premiered on June 22, 2017.[42]\n\n## See also\n\n- The Fog (novel), a 1975 novel by James Herbert\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c Hazelton, John (November 13, 2007). \"The Mist | Reviews\".

Mr Ridley refers to Ronald Ridley, an old family friend of the Rowlings. This man's name was the inspiration for Ron Weasley's name. It is not certain who exactly Susan Sladden is, but she could be the Susan Jo once referred to in an interview as the woman who used to look after Jessica (Jo's daughter) while Jo worked on the Harry Potter books.\n\n## Book description[]\n\n\"Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to find out about the mysterious event to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for hundreds of years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - not even by Wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be deadly.\"\n\n## Plot[]\n\n### Chapter 1: The Riddle House[]\n\nNagini in The Riddle House\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn August of 1943, an absurd tragedy occurred inside the Riddle House, and nobody was able to find out how it happened. When the Riddles' maid went to work that day, she discovered all three Riddles dead in the drawing room, \"still in their dinner things\". The police found no evidence of murder or suicide, claiming to be in perfect health except for the fact that they were dead. They arrested the Riddles' gardener Frank Bryce for questioning, since the door and windows were not forced open or shattered on the night of their murder, and the Riddles' cook testified that he was the only one with a key to the house. Frank, however, said the only person he saw that night was a mysterious dark-haired boy, and was released due to lack of evidence, but many still believed he committed the murders.\n\nHalf a century later on the night of 16 August, 1994, an elderly Frank is still working as the groundskeeper at the Riddle house. He sees a fire flickering in one of the rooms and goes over to investigate, thinking it is a couple boys who regularly disturb him. Inside, he overhears the same boy he saw on the night of the Riddles' murder, now grown up as Lord Voldemort (who, still unknown to him, was Tom Riddle Senior's unwanted son), and his servant Peter Pettigrew planning to capture Harry Potter with the aid of a reliable servant. Voldemort, Frank learns, also plans to reward Pettigrew for his help in capturing Bertha Jorkins, a Ministry of Magic employee who Voldemort extracted information from before killing. Frank is then discovered by Voldemort's snake Nagini, who reports his presence to her master via Parseltongue. When Pettigrew beckons him in as a guest, Frank stands up to Voldemort, who is unhappy that Muggles like the elderly gardener would be spying on him. Frank doesn't know what a Muggle is, and despite being offended that Voldemort called him one when it is explained that term means he's not a wizard, he is still determined to inform the police about the intruders' plot but becomes horrified upon seeing Voldemort's weak form. Voldemort then casts the Avada Kedavra curse, ending Frank's life before the book can describe what Voldemort looks like. Simultaneously, about 200 miles away in the Surrey town of Little Whinging, Harry Potter wakes up from a nightmare at the Dursleys' house in Privet Drive.\n\n### Chapter 2: The Scar[]\n\nHarry feeling his scar hurting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe experience is shown to be a dream that Harry had and he wakes up with his scar hurting. Harry considers writing to his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, as well as the Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, but eventually decides to write a letter to his godfather Sirius Black, an escaped convict. Sirius was actually framed for his crimes by Peter Pettigrew, but, as the entire wizarding world except for Harry, Ron, Hermione, Remus Lupin, and Dumbledore believes him to be guilty, Sirius is in hiding. Harry does not mention the dream, only his scar hurting, and plans to send the letter once his owl, Hedwig, gets back.\n\n### Chapter 3: The Invitation[]\n\nThe invitation with too many stamps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe next day, it is revealed that Aunt Petunia has put the entire family on a diet, which Harry's not following. Suddenly a letter from Molly Weasley addressed to the Dursleys arrives. She asks if Harry can join Hermione and the Weasley family to go to the Quidditch World Cup final between Ireland and Bulgaria. Unfortunately, the letter upsets Vernon Dursley because there are so many stamps on the envelope that the postman actually rang the doorbell to laugh about it. However, one mention of Sirius Black is enough to convince Vernon Dursley to let Harry go. Harry writes back to Ron (after a letter from Ron was delivered by Ron's owl Pigwidgeon) confirming that they can come pick him up. Harry writes an extra sentence or two to Sirius's letter explaining that he will be heading to The Burrow before sending the letter via Hedwig.\n\n### Chapter 4: Back to The Burrow[]\n\nMr Weasley destroying the Dursley's sitting room\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the Weasleys attempt to use Floo Powder to access the Dursley household, unaware that they have an electric fireplace. The Dursleys are shocked after Mr Weasley destroys half the sitting room. Mr Weasley sends the boys back, but not before Fred purposely drops a Ton-Tongue Toffee on the floor. Dudley Dursley, unable to resist due to the diet the family has been following and his fondness for sweets of all sorts, attempts to eat it and experiences the magical effects of a bigger tongue. Harry exits for The Burrow as Uncle Vernon starts throwing china figurines at Mr Weasley.\n\n### Chapter 5: Weasley's Wizard Wheezes[]\n\nBill and Charlie enchanting tables outside The Burrow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpon arriving at The Burrow, Harry meets Ron's older brothers Bill and Charlie. Before they have a chance to talk, Mr Weasley arrives back home and angrily explains that Dudley's tongue grew to be four feet long and turned purple before he was allowed to fix it. He points out that this incident could undermine the Muggle-wizard relations he has been working so hard to improve even after the twins tell him they did it because Dudley bullies Harry. Mrs Weasley learns what happened and joins in the scolding of the twins.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry leaves the room and learns that Molly is upset about Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, a business enterprise Ron's brothers Fred and George set up to sell their self-invented sweets and prank objects. Mrs Weasley forced them to stop, since she wanted them to have a more reputable career in the Ministry after graduation.\n\nAfter the spat, the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione enjoy a lovely dinner in the garden. At the table a lot of topics are discussed: the upcoming Quidditch World Cup, Bill's personal appearance, Sirius Black's whereabouts (a private conversation by Harry, Ron, and Hermione), a missing Ministry Witch named Bertha Jorkins. Percy (who has joined the Ministry following his recent graduation) mentions a top-secret event that he is up to in the Ministry, which will take place after the Quidditch World Cup.\n\n### Chapter 6: The Portkey[]\n\nThe boot Portkey used for the Cup\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHarry, Hermione, and the Weasleys (excluding Bill, Charlie, and Percy, who would apparate later, and Mrs Weasley, who would not be attending) travel early the next morning to the site of the Quidditch World Cup Final via a Portkey, an enchanted object that can transport large groups of people across large distances in a short time. Mr Weasley explains that two hundred Portkeys have been placed around Britain to transport thousands of wizards and that they will be using the one at Stoatshead Hill. There they meet Cedric Diggory, captain of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, and his father, Amos. Fred and George are not too keen to see Cedric due to his team beating Gryffindor last year, and Mr Diggory makes a big deal of it despite Cedric himself stating it was a fluke. They then gather around and use Portkey on Mr Weasley's signal, transporting to the Quidditch World Cup Final.\n\n### Chapter 7: Bagman and Crouch[]\n\nThe Hat of the Leprechauns\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter arriving and setting up their tents at a wizard campsite, Harry, Ron, and Hermione witness international members of the wizarding community while getting water. As the older Weasley children arrive and the group makes lunch, they meet Ludo Bagman, the match commentator and head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports and the man who got them their tickets. During their talk, against their father's wishes, Fred and George make a bet with Ludo: their entire life savings and a fake wand that Ireland will win, but the Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum will catch the Golden Snitch. Arthur also asks Bagman if they found Bertha Jorkins yet.\n\nPercy's boss, Barty Crouch, head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation then arrives looking for Bagman, though he has to shush Bagman when he starts to talk about a big event coming up at Hogwarts. Later that night, after getting some souvenirs, the group heads to the match.\n\n### Chapter 8: The Quidditch World Cup[]\n\nViktor Krum chasing the gold snitch at the World Cup\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile at the Top Box in the World Cup stadium, Harry meets Winky the house-elf, a friend of Dobby's, who is saving a seat for Mr Crouch (who never shows up). The Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, as well as Lucius Malfoy with his wife and Draco (though both the Weasleys and Malfoys have to restrain themselves out of respect for Fudge), are also in the box. After Bagman introduces both teams' mascots, the match is intense and exciting, with amazing skill displayed on both sides, particularly from Krum. A fight breaks out between the two team's mascots after Ireland is awarded many penalty shots, which angers the Veela.\n\nIreland quickly gains a massive lead and wins the match, despite Krum catching the Golden Snitch. After the match, both teams head to the Top Box and Fudge awards Ireland the Quidditch World Cup, while Fred and George rejoice about winning their bet with Bagman.\n\n### Chapter 9: The Dark Mark[]\n\nRiot at the Quidditch World Cup\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter the wizards around the campsite celebrate before going to sleep, that night, a group of masked wizards attack the camp and torment some local Muggles. While Mr Weasley heads out with his older children to face them, the rest of the group hides in the woods. When Ron trips on a tree branch, he, Harry, and Hermione, lose Fred, George, and Ginny. They run into Draco Malfoy, who goads them about the riot and tells them to keep Hermione, the \"mudblood\", safe. Shortly afterwards, Harry realises his wand is missing, and they find Winky behaving strangely, as if she were to trying to restrain something. After finding a place to hide, they hear someone nearby incant \"Morsmordre\", and they watch the Dark Mark float into the sky.\n\nThe Ministry is quickly at the scene, stunning anything that moves. After determining that Harry, Ron, and Hermione had nothing to do with the Dark Mark, they search nearby to find Winky holding Harry's wand. A quick spell proves that Harry's wand conjured the Dark Mark. Even though no one thinks Winky did it, Barty Crouch publicly fires her, leaving Hermione incensed. Mr Weasley is forced to take the group back to their tents where the others are.\n\nAfter the attack, Mr Weasley mentions that the Dark Mark is the sign that Voldemort's supporters leave whenever they murder someone. The group also learns that the hooded wizards were Death Eaters, followers of Voldemort. Bill mentions that the ones from tonight strangely fled the scene when the Dark Mark was cast in the sky, likely because they were afraid Voldemort would punish them for failing to stay loyal to him after his downfall. Mr Weasley then insists they go back to bed, since they would be leaving by Portkey in a few hours. Harry can't sleep due to taking this as a sign that Voldemort's making another plan to get his powers back.\n\n### Chapter 10: Mayhem at the Ministry[]\n\nRon's dress robes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe next morning, the group quickly departs the campsite and arrives at The Burrow, where a worried Mrs Weasley greets them. Mrs Weasley shows them the Daily Prophet article covering last night's attack, which is filled with some inaccurate details penned by Rita Skeeter, a journalist well known for her heavily negative stories. This forces Mr Weasley to head to the Ministry with Percy to straighten things out, as he is indirectly mentioned in the article.\n\nHeading into Ron's room, Harry tells Ron and Hermione about his scar hurting and his letter to Sirius, as well as the dream. The three remark on how strange it is that Harry's scar hurt so soon before the Dark Mark appeared for the first time in thirteen years.\n\nOn the final day before they are to return to Hogwarts, Harry hears that the Ministry of Magic has come under heavy fire for failing to stop the riot at the Quidditch World Cup or arrest any of the culprits because of Rita Skeeter's article. Mr Weasley mentions that Rita is also attacking the Ministry because of the disappearance of Bertha Jorkins. Meanwhile, Ron is dismayed by his hideous hand-me-down dress robes, which he will need to wear at Hogwarts for a formal occasion later in the year.\n\n### Chapter 11: Aboard the Hogwarts Express[]\n\nThe rain-washed Hogwarts trunks and owl cages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe next morning, Harry overhears a conversation between Mr Weasley and Amos Diggory (who is communicating through the Floo Network) about an ex-Auror named Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, who was attacked in his home the previous night. Amos needs Mr Weasley's help in clearing things up before the situation gets worse. Charlie informs Harry that an Auror is basically an evil wizard catcher.\n\nAfter Mr Weasley leaves, Percy, who needs to get back to work, departs. This leaves the rest of the adults to take the children to King's Cross Station by Muggle taxi. At the station, the kids say good-bye to Mrs Weasley, Bill, and Charlie, and the adults suggest that the year ahead would be an exciting one for all of the Hogwarts students, as well as other wizards and witches.\n\nIn the Hogwarts Express, after chatting about other wizarding schools across Europe and the Quidditch World Cup, Draco Malfoy also speaks about the mysterious upcoming event, that Mrs Weasley, Charlie and Bill were talking about earlier and says that there's glory and money involved.\n\n### Chapter 12: The Triwizard Tournament[]\n\nThe announcement of the Triwizard Tournament\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter arriving at the castle and dealing with one of Peeves' pranks, the trio heads to the Gryffindor Table for the Sorting Ceremony, the first in three years for Harry. Here they meet Colin Creevey, who reveals his younger brother Dennis is one of the new students. During the ceremony, Dennis is placed in Gryffindor. The Start-of-Term Feast then begins. After Nearly Headless Nick brings up the subject of Peeves causing problems in the kitchen, Hermione learns that house-elves work there. This makes her even more angry about the way house-elves are treated, especially since house-elves do not get any benefits (which the house-elves themselves do not want). She then refuses to eat any more food in protest.\n\nAfter making a few start-of-term notices, Professor Dumbledore announces that instead of having Quidditch this year (which created lots of mayhem, especially from the Weasley twins), a very special event is going to take place at Hogwarts. Before he goes on, a mysterious man with a bizarre appearance appears in the Great Hall. Dumbledore identifies him as Mad-Eye Moody, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Afterwards, Dumbledore states this event is the Triwizard Tournament, which will start at the end of October on Hallowe'en. The Tournament calls for a single champion from each of the three largest wizarding schools in Europe to compete in a series of three trials for the prize of one thousand Galleons. Though it wasn't in play in the past due to the vast number of student deaths, Dumbledore reveals that both Crouch (Department of International Co-operation) and Bagman's (Department of Games and Sports) departments at the British Ministry of Magic have decided to reinstate the tournament under the condition that new safety rules are used, including that no student under the age of seventeen will submit their name for consideration. The students are then sent to bed, though Fred and George plot to find a way to bypass Dumbledore's safety measures so they can enter the tournament, to get fame and glory, as well as money.\n\n### Chapter 13: Mad-Eye Moody[]\n\nMad-Eye Moody\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the morning of their first day back, Harry, Ron, and Hermione prepare to begin the classes in their school schedule, though Harry is concerned about why Hedwig had not returned with a reply from Sirius. Hermione has also ended her hunger strike, deciding to stand up for house-elf rights in a different manner. First the Gryffindor fourth-years have lessons for Herbology, then Care of Magical Creatures, where Hagrid teaches about monstrous creatures known as Blast-Ended Skrewts. Lastly, Harry and Ron have Divination, where Sybill Trelawney assigns the class extra homework after Ron makes a rude comment to Lavender Brown.\n\nAt dinner, Draco Malfoy insults Ron by showing Ron a Daily Prophet article that casts Ron's father Arthur Weasley (identified in the article as Arnold Weasley) in a bad light by Rita Skeeter, who somehow found out about the attack on Alastor Moody's home, even after the Ministry of Magic tried to keep it secret. While Harry and Hermione restrain an angry Ron, Draco makes some rude comments about Mrs Weasley. After Harry counters this by making a rude comment about Draco's mother and starts walking away, an angry Draco attempts to curse Harry from behind. Moody quickly intervenes, transfiguring Draco into a white ferret and bouncing him around until Professor McGonagall appears. After seeing what he's doing and putting two and two together, McGonagall undoes the spell. She then proceeds to tell Moody off by stating they never punish the students by hexing them. Moody defends his actions by explaining he thought a good sharp shock would be sufficient. Professor McGonagall tells him they punish the students by giving them detentions or speaking with the offender's Head of House. With that, Moody takes Draco Malfoy to see Professor Snape.\n\nAfter Hermione leaves to do some extracurricular work (even with no homework given out to her), Fred, George, and their friend Lee Jordan show up and tell Harry and Ron how cool Moody's (Defence Against the Dark Arts) class is. Ron finds out it will be a few days before Ron and Harry will have their first lesson with Moody.\n\n### Chapter 14: The Unforgivable Curses[]\n\nA spider receiving an Unforgivable curse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn their first lesson with Moody on Thursday, Moody, after revealing he will only be staying for the year, decides to show the fourth-year Gryffindors the Unforgivable Curses. Despite some fear amongst the students (especially Neville, who needs comfort from both the trio and Moody after the lesson; Moody later lends Neville a Herbology book to cheer him up), Moody shows the entire class the three curses using spiders as his test subjects: the Imperius Curse, a mind-control spell, the Cruciatus Curse, a pain-inflicting spell, and the Killing Curse, a spell that causes instant death to any living thing it hits. He also reveals the the use of these spells gain the user a one-way ticket to Azkaban.\n\nLater that night after dinner in their Common Room, Harry and Ron fake their Divination homework after finding it too difficult. Harry notices Fred and George plotting something, though he is unable to figure out what. Later on, Hermione shows up and reveals that she has started SPEW, a club for fighting for house-elf rights and has just spent time in the library researching house-elf history. She wants Harry and Ron to join, but before the conversation is carried out further, Hedwig returns with a letter from Sirius.\n\nSirius says there are rumours about Harry's scar hurting and he is returning to Britain. Harry feels worried about Sirius coming back and possibly getting caught by the Ministry, all because he hastily sent the letter. He goes to bed unsettled.\n\n### Chapter 15: Beauxbatons and Durmstrang[]\n\nDurmstrang's Submarine Ship\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEarly the next day, a concerned Harry sends a letter to Sirius claiming he is fine and that Sirius won't have to return to Britain. Over the next couple of weeks, Harry fights off his concerns for Sirius while waiting for Hedwig to get back. In Defence Against the Dark Arts, Moody has his students practise resisting the Imperius Curse. Only Harry is able to resist it, despite slightly bruising his knees in the process; it takes him a couple more tries before he can completely resist it. During Transfiguration, Professor McGonagall explains to her fourth-year students, as she assigns them extra homework, that this is the time for them to start preparing for the O.W.L. examinations, which will occur at the end of their next year.\n\nFollowing Care of Magical Creatures, the group returns to the castle and sees a crowd of students looking at a sign posted to the wall. The sign reveals that in about a week, on 30 October, lessons will end early due to the delegations from the two other schools, the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and the Durmstrang Institute, arriving that evening. The lesson cut off, for Gryffindors was Potions, and the Trio felt lucky, especially when Snape hinted of a poisoning, to find out if their antidotes work or not. Over the next week, Hogwarts Castle undergoes a major refit: the castle is redecorated and the nervous staff members prepare for the delegates to arrive.\n\nOn 30 October, Harry again hears Fred and George Weasley talking: this time, he hears that they are talking about sending a letter to a certain person. The trio talk with the twins about the Triwizard Tournament, and Hermione brings up house-elves. Fred and George suggest she should visit the Hogwarts Kitchen just to see for herself how happy they are, despite Hermione's insistence that they are being brainwashed.\n\nThe owls then arrive, including Hedwig. Sirius mentions that he has seen through Harry's ruse and asks Harry not to worry about him, but rather to watch out for himself and keep him posted on the recent events at Hogwarts. Sirius also asks that Harry use a different owl next time when sending him a message, as Hedwig, a snowy owl, would attract too much attention.\n\nThat night, each of the Houses are assembled in a line in the Great Hall while waiting for the delegates to arrive. The first comes by flying carriage, the second shortly afterwards via submerged ship, with their respective heads: Madame Maxime (Headmistress of Beauxbatons), a woman as big as Hagrid, and Igor Karkaroff (Headmaster of Durmstrang). Viktor Krum is revealed to be among the Durmstrang students, which makes Ron, a little excited.\n\n### Chapter 16: The Goblet of Fire[]\n\nThe Goblet of Fire\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe students sit down at their tables (with the Beauxbatons students at the Ravenclaw table and Durmstrang at Slytherin), and the Welcoming Feast begins. Hagrid, Ludo Bagman, and Barty Crouch all arrive late. After the feast, Dumbledore announces that Bagman and Crouch, who helped organise the tournament, will also serve as judges alongside the three headmasters to evaluate the Champions' performances. Dumbledore then announces that the three champions will be chosen by the Goblet of Fire, an enchanted artefact. Students must drop their names into the Goblet, and the Goblet chooses the most worthy entrants to compete in three dangerous tasks. Dumbledore finishes by stating the champions will be selected the following night during Hallowe'en. On the way out, the Durmstrang headmaster Karkaroff gives Harry a look of displeasure before Moody forces him to move along. The Goblet is placed in the Great Hall and an Age Line is drawn around the Goblet to prevent underage students from submitting their names.\n\nThe next day, predictably, Fred and George attempt to cross the line through the use of an Ageing Potion, but they are repelled by the line. The pair has to be sent to the Hospital Wing to have their long grey beards removed, much to everyone's amusement, while Dumbledore states that their beards are finer than those of the other students who tried to enter. That afternoon, Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid at his cabin and find that he has gotten dressed up for Madame Maxime. He refuses Hermione's offer to join S.P.E.W., pointing out that the house-elves enjoy their work.\n\nThat night, during the Hallowe'en feast, the champions are announced: Viktor Krum, the Seeker for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team, representing Durmstrang; Fleur Delacour, a beautiful girl Harry and Ron met the night before, representing Beauxbatons; and Cedric Diggory of Hufflepuff representing Hogwarts. Unexpectedly, a fourth name is thrown from the Goblet of Fire: Harry Potter, much to the suprise of everyone and dismay of some.\n\n### Chapter 17: The Four Champions[]\n\nHarry – the Fourth Champion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince Harry neither submitted his name nor asked an older student to do so, the assembly is dumbfounded. Harry himself is feeling very confused as he heads into the room where the champions are waiting. Although protests issue from the heads of the other schools, it is decided that the Goblet of Fire has spoken and that changes must be made accordingly. While many think Harry has somehow circumvented Dumbledore's age-restricting barrier, Moody suggests that perhaps someone entered Harry's name under a fourth school to ensure he would be included in the competition, hoping he might not survive the perilous tasks.\n\nCrouch reveals that the First Task is on 24 November and the champions have until then to figure out what it is and to prepare for it. The champions are forbidden to receive any help from anyone else. They are told that they will learn the details of the Second Task after completing the First Task. They will also be exempt from the end-of-year exams due to the tournament.\n\nThe group disbands and Cedric talks with Harry briefly as they are heading back to their respective dormitories. Harry tries to tell him that he did not put his name nor ask for it, but his efforts are wasted. At the Gryffindor Common Room, most of the other Gryffindor students throw a party to celebrate, despite Harry's displeasure. Afterwards he returns to his dormitory, where Ron refuses to believe Harry's story about not entering the tournament.\n\n### Chapter 18: The Weighing of the Wands[]\n\nRita Skeeter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHermione explains to Harry the next morning that his entry into the competition strained his relationship with Ron, who feels once again left in the shadow of his friend. Harry reluctantly accepts Hermione's advice to send a letter to Sirius to update him on what happened. He sends a letter with a school barn owl, much to Hedwig's chagrin.\n\nRon is not alone in shunning Harry; a great many of the students from all three schools assume he somehow cheated his way into the tournament. This makes Harry's life miserable, even though his fellow Gryffindors (excluding Ron) are proud that Harry will be in the tournament. The stress makes it difficult for Harry to concentrate on his lessons over the next week.\n\nIn Potions, the Slytherin students wear insulting badges that cause an angry Harry to attempt to curse Malfoy. Goyle and Hermione end up cursed instead, and both head to the Hospital Wing. Though Harry and Ron reconnect when Snape takes 50 points away from Gryffindor and gives them detention for yelling at him, Ron refuses to reconcile with Harry.\n\nDuring a Potions lesson with Snape, Colin Creevey arrives to pick up Harry, as Mr Bagman requires him for a photo session. Rita Skeeter interviews Harry in a closet for a piece she is writing on the Triwizard Tournament, before the much important Wand weighing ceremony begins. Harry tells her he doesn't know how he entered the tournament, but she manages to twist his words before Dumbledore interrupts, stating the ceremony is about to begin.\n\nHere Harry sees the Wand Creator Mr Ollivander again. After examining the other champion's wands, he examines Harry's and deems it in perfect condition. After the champions and judges go through a long photoshoot, Harry goes to dinner and then returns to Gryffindor Tower. Ron tells Harry that he has an owl and that their detention starts later. Going to where the school barn owl is with Sirius's letter, Harry reads that Sirius thinks it is too risky to communicate by letter and that he will contact Harry on 22 November at 1:00 a.m. Harry must be alone at the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room at that time.\n\n### Chapter 19: The Hungarian Horntail[]\n\nThe Dragons of the First Task\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHarry's impending talk with Sirius helps him through his embarrassment about Rita Skeeter's news article, which told a highly inaccurate version of his life story. This further deepens the rift with Ron, who thinks Harry is trying to get attention. Ravenclaw Cho Chang is the only person outside of Gryffindor who wishes Harry good luck with the first task that is coming up on that Tuesday. Harry finds himself infatuated with her.\n\nOn the Saturday prior to the first task, the students visit Hogsmeade village. Harry goes with Hermione under his Invisibility Cloak so he can relax and avoid dealing with anymore criticism. While they are at the Three Broomsticks Inn drinking Butterbeer, Moody spots Harry through the guise of his cloak and tells Hagrid. Hagrid asks Harry to meet him at midnight, one hour before his meeting with Sirius.\n\nThe Gamekeeper sneaks Harry into a meeting with Maxime; she does not know Harry, who is again hidden under his cloak, is there. Hagrid leads Maxime and Harry to a spot in the woods where dragons are being kept for the first task. Charlie Weasley and other dragon keepers are working to get the dragons ready for the First Task and keep them under control. Charlie talks with Hagrid and identifies the species of each of the four dragon breeds. He reveals that one is for each champion and that each must get past their assigned beast, though he and the other keepers are also there to keep things under control. Harry leaves for the castle, bumping into Karkaroff but managing to keep hidden. He realises that if Karkaroff followed Hagrid and Maxime, it was likely that Cedric will be the only champion not aware of what he would be facing.\n\nJust as Harry returns to his common room, Sirius contacts Harry via the Floo Network. Harry starts by filling him in on what has happened. Sirius then speaks and warns him that Karkaroff was once a Death Eater; he was released only after identifying other Death Eaters, and could have put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire. Sirius then mentions Rita Skeeter's article from last month regarding the attack on Moody; he suspects it was no accident and that someone may have tried to keep Moody from going to Hogwarts. Sirius also brings up the Death Eater disturbance at the Quidditch World Cup, as well as Bertha Jorkins. Jorkins, he says, disappeared in Albania, where Voldemort was last reported to be. Sirius reveals he knew Jorkins personally while they were in school and mentions that she wasn't very bright and could have easily fallen into a trap. She also would have known about the Triwizard Tournament beforehand.\n\nSirius finishes by stating that Karkaroff betrayed the Death Eaters long ago and might not be the guilty party, especially since whoever put Harry's name in the Goblet had a reason for doing so. Before he can give Harry any advice on getting past his dragon, he is interrupted by Ron and disappears from the fire. Ron demands to know whom he was talking to but Harry tells him it's none of his business and goes to bed.\n\n### Chapter 20: The First Task[]\n\nHarry mastering the Summoning Charm\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter Harry tells Hermione everything he learned recently, they try to research ways to get past a dragon in the library without success. On Monday, realising the other schools' champions know about the dragons, Harry tips off Cedric to make sure the contest is fair. Moody then appears and gives Harry some general advice on how to beat his Dragon: play to his strengths and use a simple spell to get what he needs. With Hermione's help, Harry manages to master the Summoning Charm after working on it until 2 a.m. On Tuesday, the day of the task, Mr Bagman reveals that their task is to get the Golden egg each dragon is guarding. The model dragons each champion would draw out of a small bag would determine the order they'll be going in and which dragon they'll face.\n\nHarry finds himself slated to go last. He gets the most violent of the four dragons, the Hungarian Horntail, though he declines Mr Bagman's offer for advice. Once his turn comes up, Harry manages to summon his Firebolt and fly. He uses the flying strategies he learned as a Quidditch player to lure the dragon off the eggs long enough for him to zoom in and snatch the golden egg, despite taking a minor shoulder injury during the task. Ron, realising the true danger of the Tournament, and realising that Harry was telling the truth about not putting his name in the Goblet of Fire, tries to apologise to Harry feeling terrible about how he treated him. Harry forgives him and they become best friends again, with most of Hogwarts (excluding Slytherin) backing him as well.\n\nAfter seeing his score, Harry learns from Charlie Weasley that he is currently tied with Viktor Krum for first place and that Mr Bagman needs to see him. Mr Bagman reveals to the champions that the Second Task will take place on 24 February at 9:30am and that their Golden Eggs contain a clue as to what it will be. On his way back to the castle with Ron, Rita Skeeter shows up for an interview, but Harry brushes her off.\n\n### Chapter 21: The House-Elf Liberation Front[]\n\nHermione, Harry, and Ron visiting the kitchen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter Ron is brought up to speed on what Harry has learned, he allows Harry to borrow Pigwidgeon to send Sirius a new letter updating him on the completion of the first task. Gryffindor celebrates Harry's success that night, but when Harry opens up his golden egg during the party, a horrible screech comes out. Meanwhile, Hermione learns from Fred Weasley how to get into the kitchen where the house-elves are.\n\nIn December, Rita Skeeter arrives at Hagrid's during a Care of Magical Creatures lesson with the fourth years to try to get an interview with Hagrid. Hagrid is surprised to see her there, as Dumbledore had banned her from Hogwarts Castle.\n\nThat night, Hermione does not show up to dinner. She surprises Harry and Ron as they are about to enter Gryffindor Tower and takes them to the kitchens. There they see a lot of domestic elves, and Harry is reunited with Dobby and learns that Winky is there too. Dobby reveals that it is difficult for a free house-elf to find actual work. After he spent two years failing to find work and found Winky, Dobby came to Hogwarts and had been there for a week so far; Dumbledore even agreed to pay Dobby a small wage. Winky is very sad and ashamed about being fired by her old master. Hermione tries to cheer her up, with no luck, though Winky does become slightly happier when she learns that Mr Crouch has been at Hogwarts.\n\n### Chapter 22: The Unexpected Task[]\n\nRon \"enchanted\" by Fleur Delacour\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter a Transfiguration class, McGonagall tells her students about the Yule Ball, a formal event that is scheduled for 25 December and is open to fourth years and above (though a younger student can still attend if invited by an older student as their date). She tells Harry privately that he and his dance partner will start off the event alongside the other champions and their dates as a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nOver the next few weeks, both Ron and Harry unsuccessfully attempt to find dates as they get through the final classes of the term. Fred and George are also acting suspiciously again; they want to borrow Pigwidgeon to deliver a letter to someone, but Pigwidgeon is not back yet (from delivering Sirius' letter). Harry later works up his courage and asks Cho to go to the dance with him, but learns that she had already agreed to go with Cedric. This information sours Harry's relationship with Cedric.\n\nAfter Harry returns to the Gryffindor common room, he sees Ginny comforting Ron and learns that Ron foolishly tried to ask Fleur out. Ron then tactlessly asks Hermione out, but she is going with someone else. Harry can't ask Ginny out either, since she is going with Neville. Finally, Harry manages to secure dates for both himself and Ron.\n\n### Chapter 23: The Yule Ball[]\n\nThe silvery fountain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the holidays begin, Hermione refuses to tell Ron who her date for the Yule Ball is, stating he'll make fun of her. She also reveals that after Malfoy put the curse on her that made her already large front teeth grow to a huge size, she let Madam Pomfrey shrink them to a more normal size when she healed her. Draco Malfoy tries to taunt Hermione, saying no one in their right mind would take her to the ball, but the mere mention of Mad-Eye Moody is enough to drive him back. Pigwidgeon returns with Sirius' reply. Sirius congratulates Harry for completing the first task and reminds him to stay on guard.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Dobby wakes Harry up and gives Harry his present: a pair of mismatched socks he made himself from wool he purchased with his wages. Harry then opens the presents he got from his other friends for Christmas, which include a hand-knit jumper with the image of a dragon from Mrs Weasley and a magical penknife from Sirius. After spending the day relaxing, Harry and his dorm mates get ready for the ball, then head to the Great Hall, where the event is to take place. At the start of the ball, it is revealed that Hermione is going with none other than Viktor Krum.\n\nWhen the champions reach the judges' table, Crouch is nowhere to be seen. Percy Weasley, who was promoted to Crouch's assistant, says Crouch is ill. After the entire room has their meal, the Weird Sisters start their performance for the dance. Neither Harry nor Ron have any interest in dancing (though Harry does participate in the opening dance) and their dates, the Patil sisters, soon abandon them. Ron also gets into an embarrassing argument with Hermione; he claims that Viktor Krum is the enemy and that going to the ball with him is treason.\n\nPercy sees Fred and George bothering Ludo Bagman and tries to intervene, and Mr Bagman comes over to have a chat with Harry. Harry and Ron then decide to go for a walk on the grounds to get away from the ruckus. They encounter Karkaroff having a worried discussion with Snape, and Hagrid and Maxime enjoying a tender moment. The moment is ruined when Hagrid insinuates Maxime is a Half-giant, like him. Ron naturally has to inform Harry about how serious this information is, given the nasty reputation giants have in the wizarding world. Shortly after the ball, Cedric gives Harry a hint about the egg: have a bath with it. He gives Harry the password to enter the Prefects' bathroom, and thanks him for warning him about the dragons.\n\n### Chapter 24: Rita Skeeter's Scoop[]\n\nYoung Hagrid with his little father\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRon and Hermione decide to put last night's argument behind them. Hermione isn't too surprised when she learns that Hagrid is a half-giant, as she suspected this all along. Meanwhile, Harry is reluctant to take Cedric's advice due to his jealousy about Cho.\n\nA substitute teacher, Professor Grubbly-Plank, teaches the first Care of Magical Creatures of the year. Draco Malfoy shows Harry that Rita Skeeter had published a nasty story about Hagrid and his giant heritage (which also used a quote from Draco); this has apparently driven Hagrid into hiding. This raises some questions between the trio, as nobody else heard Hagrid talking privately with Madam Maxime that night and Rita is supposed to be banned from Hogwarts.\n\nSeveral weeks pass and during another Hogsmeade visit, while hoping to find Hagrid at the Three Broomsticks Inn, the trio instead finds Ludo Bagman meeting with some goblins. During a private conversation with Mr Bagman, Harry learns that Barty Crouch has stopped coming to work and is sending Percy instructions by owl. Also, after a search, they still haven't found Bertha Jorkins. Bagman then again offers his help for the tournament, which Harry immediately declines. Fred and George's sudden appearance forces Mr Bagman to leave. Hermione then questions why Mr Bagman is trying to help Harry cheat, along with why he was meeting with goblins. Rita Skeeter, who also encountered Bagman and the goblins, then shows up to investigate. Harry and Hermione start an argument with her about her article on Hagrid.\n\nThe trio go to Hagrid's cabin and, along with Dumbledore, try to persuade him to return. They point out that not everyone has abandoned Hagrid, and that everyone has secrets in their pasts. After Dumbledore leaves, Hagrid remembers his late father telling him never to be ashamed of what he is and gets over his depression. He gives his support to Harry in the Tournament, believing that if Harry wins, he could show everyone they do not have to be ashamed of what they are. This is enough to convince Harry to put aside his pride and take Cedric's advice.\n\n### Chapter 25: The Egg and the Eye[]\n\nThe opened Dragon's Egg\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHarry sneaks into the Prefect's bathroom at night so he could have all the time he will need to figure out the clue, taking only the golden egg, his Invisibility Cloak, and the Marauder's Map with him. Harry initially has trouble figuring out how to open the egg properly, but with a little help from Moaning Myrtle, who had been spying on him, Harry opens the egg under water. This time, Harry hears voices singing and can understand them when he puts his head underwater. Harry realises that he must save something he cares about from merpeople who live in the depths of the Black Lake.\n\nOn the way back to Gryffindor tower, Harry sees Barty Crouch in Snape's office on the Marauder's Map and goes to investigate. When he falls through a trick stair and traps his leg, he accidentally drops the egg and map, attracting the attention of Filch. Filch finds the egg, and Snape soon arrives and demands Filch's help in catching someone who broke into his office. Moody then shows up, angering Snape by suggesting Snape had something to hide in his office. Snape points out that Moody searched his office after his arrival at Hogwarts. Moody then saves Harry from detection by claiming that the Marauder's Map is his own (after an invisible Harry warns him not to give it to Snape). However, Snape suspects Harry's involvement because he recognises the Marauder's Map before Moody confiscates the egg from Filch and forces the pair away.\n\nAs Moody frees Harry's leg, Harry tells Moody about how the map works and that he saw Mr Crouch on it. After Moody spends time looking over the Marauder's Map, Harry asks what Crouch was doing in Snape's office, and Moody suggests that Crouch was trying to find evidence of Snape being a Dark wizard. Moody then asks to borrow the map, and after learning what Harry was up to that night, says that Harry might consider becoming an Auror for a career.\n\n### Chapter 26: The Second Task[]\n\nGillyweed used by Harry for the Second Task\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHarry explains what happened the previous night to Ron and Hermione. Even though Harry and Ron suspect Snape might have put Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire, Hermione doubts this. Harry also sends a school owl to Sirius to update him on what happened.\n\nOver the coming weeks, even with help from Hermione and Ron as well as the library's resources (including getting McGonagall's permission for the Restricted Section), Harry struggles to think of a way to breathe underwater for an hour. Two days before the second task is to start, Sirius's response comes in. Sirius wants to know when their next trip to Hogsmeade is.\n\nOn the last night before the task, the trio are continuing their research in the school library when Fred and George appear to inform them that Professor McGonagall has summoned Ron and Hermione. Harry later sneaks back into the library after hours with his Invisibility Cloak, but can't find anything else.\n\nThe next morning, with a little help from Dobby, Harry discovers gillyweed, a plant that, when eaten, gives him fish-like qualities such as gills and fins. He quickly makes his way to the lake just as the task is about to start and finds that, once again, Percy is taking Mr Crouch's place. While swimming through the lake and fighting off a swarm of Grindylows, Moaning Myrtle points Harry in the right direction and Harry discovers a town of Merpeople, where Ron (the thing Harry would miss the most) is being held, along with Hermione (for Krum), Cho (for Cedric), and Fleur's sister.\n\nHarry frees Ron, but refuses to leave the others, despite the insistence of the Merpeople. Cedric and Krum appear and rescue their loved ones, but Fleur never arrives. With little other choice, Harry drags her sister to the surface as well, narrowly avoiding drowning as the gillyweed wears off. Although he was wrong to think the other hostages would be left to die (they would have simply returned to the surface unharmed), his bravery and valour earn him extra points from the judges, who state that he showed great \"moral fibre.\" This puts both Harry and Cedric in first place in the overall points. Ludo Bagman then reveals the third and final task is on 24 June and the champions will learn more about it a month beforehand.\n\n### Chapter 27: Padfoot Returns[]\n\nSnuffles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn March, Sirius' reply states that the trio are to meet up with him during their next Hogsmeade trip and asks them to bring food. Before Potions, Slytherin Pansy Parkinson gleefully gives Hermione a copy of Witch Weekly; Rita had published an article on Hermione Granger, saying that she is toying with both Harry and Krum's feelings. Pansy, who is quoted in the article, suggested Hermione was making illegal Love Potions. Hermione realises that Skeeter must have eavesdropped on her and Krum's conversation on the shores of the lake, and begins wondering how Rita is getting her information. After Snape gets a hold of the article, he reads it aloud, creating further laughter from the Slytherins. He then breaks the trio up and sends them to different tables. Snape also confronts Harry over the recent theft of boomslang skin and gillyweed from his office, who has no idea what he's talking about. He threatens Harry with Veritaserum, a potion that will cause Harry to tell the truth when consumed. Karkaroff then shows up to talk to Snape and sticks around until after class. Snape blows him off, but not before Harry, who purposely stayed behind, noticed that Karkaroff had tried to show Snape something on his arm.\n\nSirius meets Harry, Ron, and Hermione secretly in Hogsmeade and directs them to a mountain cave where Buckbeak and some old Daily Prophet articles are waiting (Sirius had been stealing discarded newspapers to keep up on current events). They first discuss Winky and what happened at the World Cup. Sirius suggests that whoever stole Harry's wand must have done so while they were watching the game in the Top Box, and is suspicious that Barty Crouch was looking around for something before he sacked Winky. He then finds it odd that not only did Crouch not show up during the game, but also that he is suddenly indisposed.\n\nSirius explains that Crouch was the one who sent him to Azkaban without a trial, as Crouch used to be the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and was once poised to become the next Minister for Magic. During Voldemort's previous reign, Crouch took extreme measures against the Death Eaters, including allowing the Aurors to use the Unforgivable Curses against them. While this greatly boosted Crouch's popularity and ensured that Crouch would become the next Minister, Crouch's son had been caught with a group of Death Eaters just after Voldemort's downfall. The Death Eaters in question were trying to find Voldemort and help him get his strength back. The youth was given a show trial by his father before being locked up in Azkaban; he died a year later. Shortly after Barty Crouch Jnr died, Crouch's wife died as well. Crouch's popularity dropped heavily after that, as people suspected that Crouch was a bad father. As a result, with Crouch's reputation outside the Ministry destroyed, the Minister for Magic's post went instead to Cornelius Fudge, who immediately reassigned Barty Crouch Snr to the Department of International Magical Co-operation.\n\nRon brings up Crouch's appearance in Snape's office. Sirius states that doesn't make sense, since Crouch would have kept an eye on Snape as a tournament judge. When Ron and Hermione bicker about whether Snape can be trusted, Sirius says they both have a point, as it is questionable why Dumbledore would trust Snape. Snape was interested in the Dark Arts as a child and hung out with some Slytherin students that became Death Eaters, though he also knows Snape is smart enough to not get caught by the Ministry. Harry then remembers Karkaroff's sudden appearance in their class, though Sirius can't figure out what that was about.\n\nSirius then brings all the questions of these mysterious circumstances together, including why Moody was also searching Snape's office. He asks Ron to send a letter to Percy to find out if there is any news about Crouch. Before they leave, Sirius reminds them not to wander outside Hogwarts at all for safety reasons. On the way back, the trio conclude that the scandal involving his son is the reason Crouch overreacted to seeing Winky being accused of conjuring the Dark Mark. Ron voices how he and Percy are similar. Hermione states Percy would never do what his boss did, but Ron is unconvinced.\n\n### Chapter 28: The Madness of Mr Crouch[]\n\nA crying Winky\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter sending Hedwig with the letter to Percy, the trio heads to the kitchen to give Dobby the socks Harry bought for him. They find that Winky has become intoxicated from consuming a large amount of butterbeer (which works like alcohol on house-elves). It doesn't help when Harry mentions that Mr Crouch has disappeared.\n\nHate mail soon starts popping up for Hermione in regards to Rita Skeeter's article. She has to go to the Hospital Wing due to a curse and doesn't turn up until a Care of Magical Creatures lesson, where Hagrid is having them use Nifflers to find gold coins (which is actually Leprechaun gold) he buried. Hagrid encourages Hermione to ignore the hate mail, citing the hate mail he received after Skeeter released the article about him. Hermione decides to discover how Skeeter has been getting her information when she is already banned from school grounds.\n\nIt is around Easter that Percy's response comes, along with Easter eggs from Mrs Weasley (Hermione's is smaller than Harry and Ron's because Mrs Weasley read Skeeter's article). His irradiated response doesn't help. On the night of 24 May, Harry and the other champions are called to the Quidditch pitch by Ludo Bagman and informed that a magical maze will be grown there and filled with magical obstacles. Their job is to head to the centre of the maze and touch the Triwizard Cup. Before Mr Bagman can offer Harry advice again, Krum takes Harry aside to the Forbidden Forest and questions him about his relationship with Hermione. Harry assures Krum that he and Hermione are just friends.\n\nMoments later, a rather crazy-looking Barty Crouch emerges from the forest asking for Dumbledore. He mentions that Voldemort is getting stronger and that he himself was responsible for something bad. He also mentions his son, as well as Bertha Jorkins, who is now dead. Harry goes to retrieve Dumbledore, but when he returns, they find that Krum has been stunned and Crouch has disappeared. Karkaroff accuses Mr Crouch's apparent attack on his student as a secret conspiracy by Dumbledore. Hagrid angrily demands that he apologise but Dumbledore restrains him. Dumbledore has Hagrid take Harry back to Gryffindor Tower to rest. He hints in his message not to contact Sirius until the next morning. On the way back, Hagrid scolds Harry for being out alone with Viktor Krum.\n\n### Chapter 29: The Dream[]\n\nHarry riding an owl in his \"dream\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe trio debate last night's events the following morning. Harry thinks the strange things Mr Crouch said were important, especially if Voldemort is getting stronger. The group go to the Owlery to send a letter to Sirius Black, and overhear Fred and George, who are talking about blackmailing someone that they've tried to reason with. Ron asks whom they are blackmailing, but they make it look like they are joking. After they leave, Ron points out that it is obvious Fred and George are serious about starting a Joke Shop. They are close to graduating, with only one full year left, and they have to make enough money on their own to start one. Hermione suggests telling Percy, but Ron refuses, both because of what Sirius said about Barty Crouch Snr and Percy's similarities to him. Later, they meet up with Moody. Moody reveals that he couldn't find him. He also tells them that there's nothing they can do about Crouch and that the Ministry is investigating the matter, and urges Harry to instead prepare for the final task.\n\nSirius's response arrives the following day: he scolds Harry for being out with Krum alone and late at night and says he is lucky he wasn't attacked, since it is clear to him that someone did not want Barty Crouch to reach Dumbledore, and he was probably feet away from them in the dark. He instructs Harry to stay safe and practise defensive spells for the Third Task, and demands that Harry give him his word that he won't go out of bounds again, especially not after hours. At Hermione's urging, he sends an owl back doing so.\n\nNot long later, during Divination, Harry passes out and has a vision. He sees Voldemort being informed of someone's death and torturing Wormtail for failing to prevent that person from escaping. Harry awakens with his scar hurting badly and pretends he has to go to the Hospital Wing. Harry actually goes to see Dumbledore. After spending time trying to get the password to Dumbledore's office right, Harry overhears an argument between Dumbledore, Moody, and Cornelius Fudge regarding the Barty Crouch situation. Fudge refuses to believe the words that Crouch said about Bertha Jorkins being dead, and while debating what happened to Crouch, Fudge suggests that Madame Maxime is the likely culprit given her half-giant physiology. Dumbledore accuses Fudge of acting on personal prejudice, which Fudge ignores due to Dumbledore's friendship with Hagrid. Moody interrupts the debate to explain that Harry Potter has arrived.\n\n### Chapter 30: The Pensieve[]\n\nHarry looking at Dumbledore's Pensieve\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDumbledore, Fudge, and Moody leave to examine the school grounds, and Harry is alone in Dumbledore's office. While looking around, notices Dumbledore's Pensieve, a device that stores memories. Through curiosity, Harry peers in and ends up looking into three of Dumbledore's memories. The first is the trial of Igor Karkaroff, in which he renounces his support of the Death Eaters and gives the names of existing Death Eaters, including Snape. Dumbledore (in the memory) states that Snape is a spy against Voldemort and is no longer a threat. The second memory shows the trial of Ludo Bagman, who was accused of passing information to Voldemort, even though he wasn't aware the person he gave the information to was a Death Eater; his popularity quickly clears him. The third is a trial for the Lestrange family, a group of three, and Crouch's son, Barty Crouch Jnr, for the use of the Cruciatus Curse on Alice and Frank Longbottom. Crouch sentences them all to a lifetime in Azkaban. By then Dumbledore (from the present) arrives and brings Harry back.\n\nAfter Dumbledore explains what happened and shows Harry another of his memories regarding a teenage Bertha Jorkins during her Hogwarts years, Harry explains what happened in Divination. Dumbledore finds Harry's scar pains to be an odd concept and brings up that this is the second time it has hurt, the first being during the summer. This shows Harry that Dumbledore has been talking to Sirius Black, and Dumbledore reveals that it was his idea for Black to hide in the cave outside Hogsmeade.\n\nDumbledore suspects that the reason why Harry's scar hurts is due to the connection that Voldemort's failed curse had created with him. He believes the scar would only hurt when Voldemort were close or was feeling a strong emotion. Dumbledore also explains to Harry that, unlike the Ministry, he believes that the disappearances of Bertha Jorkins, Barty Crouch, and a Muggle by the name of Frank Bryce may be connected to Voldemort.\n\nDumbledore also explains that Frank and Alice Longbottom are Neville's parents and they went insane due to the Lestranges' attack and that this is the reason why Neville was brought up by his grandmother and why he has such an aversion to the Cruciatus Curse. Dumbledore doesn't know if Crouch Jnr was involved, but he personally requests that Harry does not disclose this information to anyone, saying that Neville himself will share it when he is ready.\n\n### Chapter 31: The Third Task[]\n\nThe sphinx at the maze\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHarry passes on the information he learned from the Pensieve to Ron and Hermione, excluding the details about Neville's parents. Hermione realises this is what Rita Skeeter and Winky meant about Ludo Bagman being a Dark wizard. That same night, Harry's hatred of Voldemort reaches a new height because of what he learned from the Pensieve. As the task approaches, Ron and Hermione find time when they are not studying for their final exams to help Harry. Even McGonagall helps by allowing him to practise in her empty classroom during lunchtime. During one practice session, Ron notices Malfoy outside the castle sitting by a tree and doing something odd. Harry and Hermione also see him before they return to practice. Sirius sends Harry messages by owl each day, reminding Harry to focus on what is ahead.\n\nOn the day of the third task, Rita Skeeter releases an article claiming Harry is demented and dangerous. She uses a quote from Draco Malfoy in the article. This raises some questions between the trio, since the article mentions Harry's scar hurting during Divination. The class takes place in the North Tower and Skeeter is not allowed inside Hogwarts, so she shouldn't have had that information. Hermione finally figures out how Skeeter may be getting her information and leaves to put her theory to the test.\n\nMcGonagall tells the champions that their families have come to watch them complete. Harry doesn't want to meet them, expecting the Dursleys, but instead finds Molly and Bill Weasley. While they give Harry a tour of their knowledge of Hogwarts, Mrs Weasley gets into an argument with Amos Diggory regarding Harry's popularity in the tournament, before Mrs Diggory asks him to stop. They then mention to Harry that Percy will not be coming this time. After the Barty Crouch incident, which is being kept secret, Percy was hauled in for questioning regarding that the instructions he was receiving, which may not have actually been sent by Barty Crouch. Instead, Cornelius Fudge will be serving as the fifth Triwizard judge in his place.\n\nAfter the rest of the Weasley children and Hermione show up, Harry tells Mrs Weasley that everything Skeeter wrote on Hermione was a lie. After dinner, Mr Bagman takes the champions to the maze and Harry and Cedric, who are tied for first place, are sent in first.\n\nHarry successfully navigates the maze with the aid of the Four-Point Spell. He gets past both a Blast-Ended-Skrewt and a Boggart disguised as a Dementor. Along the way, he hears Fleur scream. Harry rescues Cedric, who has been attacked by a mind-controlled Krum; Harry manages to stun Krum and sends out a signal for Krum to be rescued before he and Cedric move on. Harry manages to pass a sphinx and, as he approaches the Cup, is attacked by an Acromantula. Aided by Cedric, he defeats it, though one of Harry's legs is injured in the process. After taking the monster out, they decide to grab the Cup simultaneously. Unbeknownst to them, the Cup is actually a Portkey that transports them to an old cemetery in the Muggle village of Little Hangleton.\n\n### Chapter 32: Flesh, Blood and Bone[]\n\nPeter Pettigrew making the regeneration potion for Lord Voldemort\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJust as Harry and Cedric are trying to figure out what happened, a hooded stranger appears and Harry's scar begins hurting again. A second voice orders the stranger to kill Cedric, which he does, leaving Harry frozen with shock and horror. Harry is then dragged to a large marble tombstone with the name Tom Riddle engraved upon it. The stranger then tightly binds Harry to it with thick black cords from arm, wrists, legs, neck to ankle, and gags him by stuffing black cloth in his mouth to muffle his cries for help.\n\nUnable to escape, Harry recognises the stranger as Peter Pettigrew due to the missing finger on his right hand. He also notes that Pettigrew is carrying what appears to be a deformed infant. Pettigrew takes some of Harry's blood, bone dust from Tom Riddle Snr's grave, and puts them in a cauldron. He then cuts off his own right hand, at the orders of the strange creature, and places it in a cauldron. The creature is revealed to be none other than Lord Voldemort himself, and the potion made by Pettigrew returns a physical form and restores his powers stronger than before; therefore fulfilling Sybill Trelawney's second prophecy from the previous year in its entirety.\n\n### Chapter 33: The Death Eaters[]\n\nLittle Hangleton's old cemetery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVoldemort forces Wormtail to take out his bleeding arm to activate the Dark Mark and summon the Death Eaters. While in wait, Voldemort tells Harry that after his father abandoned him and his mother upon finding out that his mother was a witch, Voldemort's mother died giving birth to him and he was raised in a Muggle orphanage. He later sought revenge by murdering his father.\n\nAfter his Death Eaters arrive, Voldemort spends time criticising them for failing to seek him out during these last thirteen years, even though they knew that he had found a way to escape mortal death. He believes they feared a power greater than his, like that of Albus Dumbledore, which is why they slipped back into normal wizarding society and claimed they were never loyal to Voldemort. Voldemort then rewards Wormtail for aiding with his rebirth by creating a new silver hand for him.\n\nVoldemort identifies more Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy, and announces his plans for rebuilding his army and punish the Death Eaters that have deserted him. Voldemort answers Lucius's question about how he had returned by explaining the protection spell that Lily Potter provided Harry when she died. That is what originally caused his downfall and provided Harry with protection from him, but now that they share the same blood, Voldemort is free to touch Harry. Voldemort then reveals that he fled deep into an Albanian forest, barely alive and without a proper body, surviving by possessing animals until Quirinus Quirrell showed up and let Voldemort share his body. Following his failure to obtain the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort returned to Albania with little hope of getting a corporeal body again.\n\nAfter fleeing the country following the events of Harry's third year, Wormtail learned of Voldemort's continued existence from other rats. Wormtail went to seek Voldemort, and during his journey, he ran into Bertha Jorkins. He delivered her to Voldemort and, through torturing her, Voldemort found out about the Triwizard Tournament. He also discovered that a faithful Death Eater servant was still alive after breaking a memory charm that had been placed on Jorkins.\n\nWith Wormtail's help, Voldemort was able to regain a body of his own and some of his powers and return to Britain. There, he plotted Harry's abduction and kidnapping, knowing that Harry's blood would remove his own mother's protection. Voldemort reveals that this servant who is at Hogwarts has ensured that Harry would win the tournament and be brought to the graveyard. Voldemort then frees the injured and weakened Harry and orders him to face him in a duel, wishing to prove who among the two is stronger in front of his minions now that there is no one around to protect Harry.\n\n### Chapter 34: Priori Incantatem[]\n\nLord Voldemort's snake-like eyes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVoldemort challenges Harry to a duel. After Harry refuses to bow to the Dark Lord, Voldemort uses the Imperius Curse on Harry to force him to. Though Harry gives in the first time, the second time he manages to shake the curse off, much to the astonishment of the Death Eaters present.\n\nWhen the duel begins, something miraculous happens. Voldemort and Harry's wands are \"brothers\", due to the fact that their wands' cores are both feathers from the same phoenix. As the wands spells meet in the air and interlock, a Priori Incantatem effect occurs. This causes the spirit echoes of Voldemort's victims, including Harry's parents, to spill out from his wand. The echoes momentarily protect Harry, allowing him to grab the Portkey and escape to Hogwarts with Cedric's body.\n\n### Chapter 35: Veritaserum[]\n\nThe trunk where Moody was locked up\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen he arrives back at the school, many of the students begin to scream when they see Cedric's body. During the confusion, where an exhausted Harry tries to tell Dumbledore what happened, Harry is ushered away by Moody while Dumbledore and Fudge are busy with Cedric's parents. Moody takes Harry to his office, where Harry sits in shock and Moody gives him a potion to bring him around. As Moody probes Harry for information, Harry says he believes that Karkaroff is the faithful servant that Voldemort mentioned. Moody reveals that when the Dark Mark was activated, Karkaroff fled Hogwarts, since he had betrayed the Death Eaters and could never go back to them.\n\nAfter Moody reveals he knows that Harry was taken to the graveyard and that he is angry that Voldemort did not try to torture the Death Eaters that had abandoned him, he tells Harry that he was responsible for putting Harry's name in the Goblet of Fire under a different school. He purposely tipped off Hagrid about the dragons so Hagrid could show Harry and gave Harry a hint for beating the first task. He gave Cedric the clue to the egg for the second task, knowing that Cedric would tell Harry. Moody's original plan was to have Harry use Neville's Herbology book to learn about the gillyweed, but since Harry would not ask for help, Moody purposely set up the conversation with McGonagall about gillyweed so Dobby would get it from Snape's office. Moody also reveals that he was responsible for helping Harry in the third task by dealing with the obstacles, stunning Fleur, and bewitching Krum to take out Cedric.\n\nMoody attempts to kill Harry to please his master, but before he has the chance, Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall burst in and Dumbledore stuns him. Dumbledore tells Harry this man is not Alastor Moody, which Dumbledore realised when Moody took Harry from Dumbledore, something the real Moody would never do. Dumbledore sends Snape to get a potion and fetch Winky; he also sends McGonagall to tell a large black dog she would find at the pumpkin patch to go to his office. He then opens Moody's trunk and finds the real Alastor Moody inside the seventh compartment.\n\nDumbledore discovers that the impostor has been using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Alastor Moody all year, keeping the real Moody alive so he could use his hair as an ingredient, though he suspects in the excitement of tonight the impostor forgot to take his most recent dosage. They wait until the effects wear off, revealing that the impostor is Barty Crouch Jnr, just as Snape, McGonagall, and Winky arrive.\n\nUnder the effects of Snape's Veritaserum, Crouch Jnr is asked by Dumbledore how he escaped Azkaban. Crouch Jnr confesses that his father, Barty Crouch Snr and his mother helped him escape Azkaban. His mother was dying, and it was his mother's wish that he could escape, so Barty Crouch Jnr and his mother switched places using the Polyjuice Potion. Mrs Crouch died and was buried disguised as him, while Crouch Snr had a private funeral for her to conceal the truth.\n\nBarty Crouch Snr put the Imperius Curse on his son to make sure he was controlled and out of sight. Bertha Jorkins found out when she came to their house on business while Crouch Snr was not home, forcing Crouch Snr to place a Memory Charm on her; this permanently damaged her memory. After Winky persuaded her master to let his son go to the Quidditch World Cup, they arranged to use an Invisibility Cloak to hide Crouch Jnr as he sat in the Top Box. During this event, Crouch Jnr secretly fought the curse and stole Harry's wand when Winky wasn't looking. When the Death Eaters showed up and disrupted the tournament, Barty Crouch Jnr was angry that they weren't loyal to Voldemort. After regaining control he used Harry's wand to summon the Dark Mark, which scared the Death Eaters away. His father fired Winky for failing to watch him and almost letting him escape. He then found him and took him home.\n\nEventually, thanks to Bertha's information, Voldemort and Wormtail were able to find Crouch Jnr and release him from his father's imprisonment. Learning from Bertha about Alastor Moody becoming a teacher at Hogwarts, he and Wormtail captured Moody, allowing Crouch Jnr to be planted at Hogwarts as Moody, with Wormtail keeping an eye on Crouch. He kept Moody alive not only to maintain his disguise, but also learned about his habits so he could fool Dumbledore.\n\nIt is revealed that Crouch Jnr was the Barty Crouch Harry saw on the Marauder's Map, stealing potions ingredients from Snape's office to continue making the Polyjuice Potion. Eventually, Crouch started to fight off the Imperius curse placed upon him and was then kept under home imprisonment by Wormtail under the pretence of being unwell. He managed to escape and travel to Hogwarts to warn Dumbledore of his son's existence. However, using the Marauder's Map, Crouch Jnr was able to intercept and kill him. He then transfigured his father's body into a bone and buried it in Hagrid's yard. Crouch Jnr, as Moody, then offered to take the Triwizard Cup into the maze so he could turn it into a Portkey and complete his master's plan.\n\n### Chapter 36: The Parting of the Ways[]\n\nThe Dark Mark, the Death Eaters' symbol\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDumbledore takes Harry to his office to meet Sirius, but not before placing McGonagall in charge of Crouch Jnr. He also sends Snape to take Moody to the Hospital Wing and bring Cornelius Fudge up to Moody's office.\n\nOnce in Dumbledore's office, Harry tells Dumbledore and Sirius everything. Dumbledore explains the Priori Incantatem effect and says that the spirits that appeared were echoes of Voldemort's most recent victims. After Sirius transforms back into a dog they head to the Hospital Wing, where Harry is given a Sleeping Potion to help him relax.\n\nUpon waking up, he, along with Molly and Bill Weasley, hear a large argument. Fudge summoned a Dementor as protection when he went to confront Crouch Jnr, which sucked out Crouch Jnr's soul before he, McGonagall, Snape, and Dumbledore entered the Hospital Wing. Dumbledore is upset that they lost a key piece of evidence on Voldemort's return, while Fudge believes the man was a lunatic and that his testimony would not have been useful.\n\nDue to reading Rita Skeeter's last article about Harry being dangerous, Fudge cannot accept Harry's testimony, nor does he believe Dumbledore's information about Harry's scar. Harry gets up and tries to identify the Death Eaters whose names he heard earlier, but Fudge points out they were cleared long ago and he might have read this out of an old Daily Prophet article. Fudge is offended by Dumbledore's suggestions of removing the Dementors from Azkaban and sending an envoy to make an agreement with the giants. Even after Snape reveals his Dark Mark and explains that Voldemort had summoned him, Fudge thinks it is some kind of a ploy and makes it clear that he is going to have a serious talk with Dumbledore about his position before he leaves. He then exits the room, but not before he gives Harry his winnings from the Tournament.\n\nBill Weasley leaves at Dumbledore's request to inform his father of the situation and have him discreetly contact those within the Ministry that can be convinced of the truth. McGonagall is sent to retrieve Hagrid and Madame Maxime for a mission. After Madam Pomfrey is sent to look after Winky, Dumbledore has Sirius revert to his true form. Both Mrs Weasley and Snape are surprised by his presence, but are quickly convinced of his innocence. Dumbledore dispatches Sirius to reinstate the Order of the Phoenix by gathering known wizards and witches who would support their side. Harry then regrets asking Cedric to grab the Triwizard cup with him, and then uses the last of the potion to return to sleep.\n\n### Chapter 37: The Beginning[]\n\nThe beetle Rita Skeeter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter a few days of rest, Harry meets with Cedric's parents. They do not blame him for what happened and are thankful to have his body, but decline Harry's offer of the winnings. Harry is able to have a relaxing time, due to Dumbledore having made a formal request for the students to not talk about what happened that night, though some students are still unsettled due to Rita Skeeter's article.\n\nHagrid gives the trio a good lecture on how Voldemort's return was inevitable and all they can do now is fight. Hagrid mentions that what Dumbledore has assigned for him is top secret and that Madam Maxime might be accompanying him.\n\nDuring the Leaving Feast, a memorial feast for Cedric is held, where Dumbledore tells the school what has happened in the graveyard despite the Ministry's wishes that he keep it secret. Afterwards, everyone is packed and ready to leave. Fleur and Krum both say good-bye to the trio before they head back to their schools, while the trio take their carriage to the Hogwarts Express.\n\nAs Harry, Ron, and Hermione ride to King's Cross Station, they learn that the Daily Prophet is not reporting Cedric Diggory's death, likely due to the Ministry's interference. Hermione reveals that she has discovered that Rita Skeeter is an unregistered animagus who can turn into a beetle. Hermione caught Skeeter in a jar in the Hospital Wing after the third task. As the three think back, they realise that there was a bug on the statue the night of the Yule Ball where Hagrid told Madame Maxime his secret, that Krum found a bug in Hermione's hair after the Second Task, and that there was a bug on the window that day in Divination when Harry's scar hurt. They also realise that the reason why Rita got those interviews from Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson undetected was that they knew she was an animagus; Harry recalled Draco sitting by a tree that day talking while holding a bug. Hermione assures Harry and Ron that her stories will trouble them no longer, since she told Rita that if the stories continued, she would tell the Ministry about her secret.\n\nJust as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle arrive and taunt Harry over Voldemort's return, they are rendered unconscious from hexes used by both the trio and Fred and George Weasley. Harry, Ron, and George then began kicking, rolling, and pushing the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle into a spot where they will be out of the way. Soon another mystery is solved: The person that Fred and George were hinted to have been blackmailing was Ludo Bagman. When the twins won their bet, he paid them their winnings at the Quidditch World Cup in Leprechaun gold and wouldn't even return their original wager. This is also why he tried to avoid them in public when they confronted him.\n\nThe twins reveal that Bagman has a long-time problem with gambling and he was also in debt to the goblins, who took his money after the World Cup and followed him to Hogwarts. Bagman made a bet that Harry would win the tournament to get his money back, which is why he was trying to help Harry cheat. However, since Harry and Cedric actually \"tied\" for first place, Bagman has gone on the run. As they get off the train and step and leave the Malfoy and his gang, Harry gives the twins his Triwizard Winnings to help them with their dream of running a joke shop. Everyone then say their good-byes as Harry prepares to leave with Vernon Dursley.\n\n## List of deaths[]\n\n| Character        | Killed by                                                       | Cause of death                                                                         | Circumstances                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tom Riddle Snr   | Lord Voldemort                                                  | Killing Curse                                                                          | (Mentioned only) Revenge for abandonment of his son; baffled Muggle Police.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Thomas Riddle    | Lord Voldemort                                                  | Killing Curse                                                                          | (Mentioned only) Murdered along with Tom Riddle Snr; baffled Muggle Police.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Mary Riddle      | Lord Voldemort                                                  | Killing Curse                                                                          | (Mentioned only) Murdered along with Tom Riddle Snr; baffled Muggle Police.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Mrs Crouch       | None                                                            | Broken heart (possibly)                                                                | (Mentioned only) Took Polyjuice Potion and posed as her son, Barty Crouch Jnr and took his place in Azkaban.

The second instance is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 1 (The Riddle House), from the perspective of the Muggle caretaker, Frank Bryce. The third instance is in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 1 (The Other Minister) told from the perspective of the British Minister. The fourth instance is in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 2 (Spinner's End) told from the perspective of Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. The final instance is in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 1 (The Dark Lord Ascending) told from the perspective of nearly all of the Death Eaters.\n- The book presents a greater international aspect to the wizarding community: the Quidditch World Cup; the Triwizard Tournament and two other European wizarding schools, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; an unnamed wizarding school in Brazil; and an American wizarding institute, are either shown or mentioned.\n- Due to the uncertainty over what the book's title would be, the American audiobook by Jim Dale simply calls it \"the fourth volume in the Harry Potter series\".\n- The book mentions the name of a real person - Natalie McDonald, a nine-year-old girl from Toronto, Canada, who was dying of leukaemia. She wrote to Rowling asking what was going to happen in the next Harry Potter book as she would not live long enough to read it. The former emailed back, but Natalie had died a day earlier. In tribute, she became a first-year student at Hogwarts named by the Sorting Hat in Gryffindor - the house for the brave at heart - in the fourth book. When Rowling was later in Canada for a promotional tour she visited the McDonald family. With the exception of historical people such as Nicolas Flamel, this is the only Harry Potter book to so honour an individual.\n- Dumbledore was said to have a \"gleam of triumph\" in his eyes when told that Voldemort had restored his body using Harry's blood, at the end of Goblet of Fire (Ch. 36). Rowling has confirmed that this is \"still enormously significant\". It turned out that this was very significant because when Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself he made it so that as long as he lived Harry could not die, as revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\n- In Hogsmeade, Sirius implied that at a certain point, Snape's attendance at Hogwarts overlapped with Lestrange's. It could have meant Rodolphus or Rabastan Lestrange, Bellatrix's husband and brother-in-law respectively, as Bellatrix would have left school about two years before Snape started.\n- In the film version, it was heavily implied by the sheer number of students that everyone from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang made the trip to Hogwarts. However, in the book, it was mentioned that after the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students entered the school and the Hallowe'en feast began, there were only about twenty extra students in the Great Hall. Igor Karkaroff also said in the book (during the argument about letting Harry Potter participate in the Triwizard Tournament) that he would have brought more students to Hogwarts if he had known younger students could enter the Tournament.\n- At the end of Prisoner of Azkaban, Cornelius Fudge mentioned possibly bringing a dragon to Hogwarts to guard the school. Ironically, the Ministry does bring dragons to Hogwarts, although for a different purpose.\n- In the chapter entitled \"The Unforgivable Curses\" when Harry and Ron are doing their Divination homework, some of their fake prophecies could be considered as coming true throughout the book. For example, \"stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend,\" may refer to Ron feeling betrayed by Harry becoming a Triwizard Champion since he thought Harry really did put his name in the Goblet without telling him. And possibly feeling slightly jealous at Harry's many achievements (whether deserved or not) and when Hermione points out Ron's apparent double drowning it could be interpreted as foreshadowing to she and Ron being placed at the bottom of the lake during the second task.\n- Cedric's death marked the first occasion in the series where a protagonist is killed off (excluding minor characters such as Frank Bryce, and deaths that occurred outside of the action, such as Lily and James.)

This resulted in all assistants being listed as \"ass designer\" or \"ass painter\" etc.\n\n- GoofsRuth's accent changes randomly between very English posh and slightly Estuary (lower-class). This could be a clue that she has had to 'improve' her accent as she has ascended Lang's ladder and finds it difficult, as English people do, to keep up the pretence, especially at times of emotional stress.\n\n- QuotesAdam Lang: Spare me the bleeding-heart bullshit! Do you know what I'd do if I was in power again? I'd have two queues at airports: one for flights where we'd done no background checks, infringed on no one's civil bloody liberties, used no intelligence gained by torture. And on the other flight we'd do everything we possibly could to make it perfectly safe. And then we'd see which plane the Rycarts of this world would put their bloody kids on! And you can put that in the book!\n\n- Crazy creditsThere are no opening credits. The title and cast list do not appear until after the last scene of the movie.\n\n- Alternate versionsUS version was cut for language to secure a PG-13 rating (the usage of the words \"fuck\" and \"shit\" was severely toned down).\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Siskel &amp;amp; Ebert &amp;amp; the Movies: Valentine's Day/Percy Jackson &amp;amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief/The Wolfman/Ajami (2010)\n\n- SoundtracksHatherton\nPerformed by David Majzlin\nCourtesy of Toy Hanner Music (ASCAP)\n\n### User reviews464\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Captivating thriller with a solid script n top notch performance by Gregor.\n\nI saw this few days back on a dvd which I own.\n\nInspite of the dvd being in my drawer for a decade, I never felt the urge to go ahead.\n\nWhat a fool I was cos this is an amazing thriller with a top notch performance by Gregor.\n\nThe cinematography is excellent n the best part is the script.\n\nThe movie inspite of being a simple thriller has lots of tension n it is very captivating from the go.\n\n- Fella\\_shibby\n- Dec 19, 2021\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ23\n\n- How long is The Ghost Writer?Powered by Alexa\n- What is \"The Ghost Writer\" about?\n- Is \"The Ghost Writer\" based on a book?\n- What happened to \"The Ghost\"?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 12, 2010 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - France\n    - Germany\n    - United Kingdom\n    - Belgium\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Stream Ghost Writer officially on Disney+ Hotstar Indonesia\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Người Chấp Bút\n- Filming locations\n    - Peenemünde, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany(as Martha's Vineyard)\n- Production companies\n    - R.P.

The film was directed by James Ivory, produced by Ismail Merchant, Mike Nichols, and John Calley and adapted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. It stars Anthony Hopkins as James Stevens and Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton, with James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Hugh Grant, Ben Chaplin, and Lena Headey in supporting roles.\n\nThe film was a critical and box office success and it was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Thompson) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Jhabvala). In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked The Remains of the Day the 64th-greatest British film of the 20th century.[3]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1958 postwar Britain, Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from the former housekeeper, Miss Kenton, now Mrs. Benn. Their past employer, the Earl of Darlington, has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed by his pre–Second World War support of Nazi Germany, and his stately country house has been sold to retired US Congressman Jack Lewis. Allowed to borrow the Daimler, Stevens sets off for the West Country to see Miss Kenton for the first time in decades.\n\nIn the 1930s, Kenton arrives at Darlington Hall, where the ever-efficient but deeply repressed Stevens derives his entire identity from his profession. He butts heads with the warmer, strong-willed Kenton, particularly when he refuses to acknowledge that his father, now an under-butler, is no longer able to perform his duties.\n\nDisplaying total professionalism, Stevens carries on as his father lies dying during Darlington's conference of like-minded fascist-sympathising British and European aristocrats. Also in attendance is U.S. Congressman Lewis, who admonishes the \"gentleman politicians\" as meddling amateurs, advising that \"Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik\" and warning of impending disaster.\n\nExposed to Nazi racial laws, Darlington gets Stevens to dismiss two newly hired refugee German-Jewish maids. Kenton threatens to resign but has nowhere to go, and a regretful Darlington is later unable to rehire the maids. At another conference, Stevens is unable to answer an aristocratic guest's questions on global trade and politics, which the aristocrat claims demonstrates the lower classes' ignorance and inability to govern themselves.\n\nRelations thaw between Stevens and Kenton, and she clearly shows her feelings for him. But the outwardly detached Stevens remains dedicated solely to his role as butler. She catches him reading a romance novel, which he explains is to improve his vocabulary, asking her not to invade his privacy again.\n\nLord Darlington's godson, journalist Reginald Cardinal, arrives on the day of a secret meeting at Darlington Hall between the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the German ambassador, Joachim von Ribbentrop. Appalled by his godfather's role in seeking appeasement for Nazi Germany, Cardinal tells Stevens that Darlington is being used by the Nazis, but Stevens feels it is not his place to judge his employer.\n\nKenton forms a relationship with former co-worker Tom Benn and accepts his proposal of marriage. She informs Stevens as an ultimatum, but he will not admit his feelings and only offers his congratulations. Finding her crying, his only response is to call her attention to a neglected domestic task, and she leaves Darlington Hall before the start of the Second World War.\n\nEn route to meeting Kenton in 1958, Stevens is mistaken for a gentleman at a pub. Doctor Carlisle, a local GP, helps him refuel the Daimler, deduces that he is actually a manservant, and asks his thoughts about Lord Darlington's actions. Initially denying having even met him, Stevens later admits to having served and respected him, noting that Darlington later confessed that his Nazi sympathies had been misguided and naive.\n\nStevens tells Carlisle that, although Lord Darlington was unable to correct his error, he is attempting to correct his own. He meets Kenton, who has separated from her husband and is staying at a boarding house on the coast. She and Stevens discuss how Lord Darlington died from a broken heart after suing a newspaper for libel, losing the suit and his reputation. Stevens mentions that Cardinal was killed in the war.\n\nKenton declines to resume her position at Darlington Hall, wishing to remain near her pregnant daughter and, despite years of unhappiness, thinking about going back to her husband. Stevens supposes they may never meet again, and they part fondly but are both quietly upset, with Miss Kenton visibly tearful as her bus pulls away.\n\nStevens returns to Darlington Hall, where Lewis asks if he remembers what he had said at the conference in the 30s. Stevens replies that he was too busy serving to listen to the speeches. A pigeon flies into the fireplace from the chimney, and Lewis catches and sets it free. Stevens watches the bird as it flies away, leaving Darlington Hall far behind.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Anthony Hopkins as Mr James Stevens\n- Emma Thompson as Miss Sarah \"Sally\" Kenton (later Mrs Benn)\n- James Fox as the Earl of Darlington (Lord Darlington)\n- Christopher Reeve as Congressman Jack Lewis\n- Peter Vaughan as Mr William Stevens (\"Mr Stevens, Sr\")\n- Hugh Grant as Reginald Cardinal (Lord Darlington's godson)\n- Tim Pigott-Smith as Mr Tom Benn\n- John Haycraft as Auctioneer\n- Michael Lonsdale as Dupont d'Ivry\n- Brigitte Kahn as Baroness\n- Jeffry Wickham as Viscount Bigge\n- Paula Jacobs as Mrs Mortimer\n- Ben Chaplin as Charlie\n- Rupert Vansittart as Sir Geoffrey Wren\n- Patrick Godfrey as Spencer\n- Peter Halliday as Canon Tufnell\n- Peter Cellier as Sir Leonard Bax\n- Pip Torrens as Doctor Carlisle\n- Frank Shelley as Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain\n- Peter Eyre as the 3rd Viscount Halifax (Lord Halifax)\n- Wolf Kahler as Joachim von Ribbentrop\n- Lena Headey as Lizzie\n- John Savident as Doctor Meredith\n\n## Production\n\nA film adaptation of the novel was originally planned to be directed by Mike Nichols from a script by Harold Pinter. Meryl Streep’s then-agent, Sam Cohn, and the director sold her on the plum role of Miss Kenton. Both Streep and Jeremy Irons read for Nichols, but the filmmaker opted not to cast them in roles later filled by Emma Thompson (ten years Meryl’s junior) and Anthony Hopkins (twenty years Emma’s senior). Cohn, who was also Nichols’s agent, didn’t make it clear to Meryl that she was no longer a candidate for Miss Kenton, she only learned later, after reading about Thompson’s casting. Shortly thereafter Streep made headlines after she fired her long time, east coast agent, signing with rival agent Bryan Lourd at the powerful Creative Artists Agency.[4] Some of Pinter's script was used in the film, but, while Pinter was paid for his work, he asked to have his name removed from the credits, in keeping with his contract.[a] Christopher C. Hudgins observes: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for The Handmaid's Tale, which he has decided not to publish. When his script for The Remains of the Day was radically revised by the James Ivory–Ismail Merchant partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\" (125).[b][c][d] Though no longer the director, Nichols remained associated with the project as one of its producers.\n\nThe music was recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin.\n\n### Settings\n\nMusic room of Powderham Castle in 1983\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA number of English country estates were used as locations for the film, partly owing to the persuasive power of Ismail Merchant, who was able to cajole permission for the production to borrow houses not normally open to the public. Among them were Dyrham Park for the exterior of the house and the driveway, Powderham Castle (staircase, hall, music room, bedroom; used for the aqua-turquoise stairway scenes), Corsham Court (library and dining room) and Badminton House (servants' quarters, conservatory, entrance hall). Luciana Arrighi, the production designer, scouted most of these locations. Scenes were also shot in Weston-super-Mare, which stood in for Clevedon. The pub where Mr Stevens stays is the Hop Pole in Limpley Stoke; the shop featured is also in Limpley Stoke. The pub where Miss Kenton and Mr Benn meet is The George Inn in Norton St Philip.\n\n### Characters\n\nThe character of Sir Geoffrey Wren is based loosely on that of Sir Oswald Mosley, a British fascist active in the 1930s.[5] Wren is depicted as a strict vegetarian, like Hitler.[6] The 3rd Viscount Halifax (later created the 1st Earl of Halifax) also appears in the film. Lord Darlington tells Stevens that Halifax approved of the polish on the silver, and Lord Halifax himself later appears when Darlington meets secretly with the German Ambassador and his aides at night. Halifax was the chief architect of the British policy of appeasement from 1937 to 1939.[7] Coincidentally, Halifax was born at Powderham Castle (above). The character of Congressman Jack Lewis in the film is a composite of two separate American characters in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel: Senator Lewis (who attends the pre-WW2 conference in Darlington Hall), and Mr Farraday, who succeeds Lord Darlington as master of Darlington Hall.\n\n## Release\n\nThe film had its premiere on 25 October 1993 at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles.[8]\n\nIt was the opening night film at the London Film Festival on 4 November 1993 and opened in 94 theatres in the United States on 5 November.[9][10]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nThe film has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The consensus states: \"Smart, elegant, and blessed with impeccable performances from Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, The Remains of the Day is a Merchant–Ivory classic.\"[11] At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, it received a score of 86 based on 12 reviews.[12] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[13]\n\nRoger Ebert particularly praised the film, calling it \"a subtle, thoughtful movie.\"[14] In his favorable review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, \"Put Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and James Fox together and you can expect sterling performances.\"[15] Vincent Canby of The New York Times said, in another favorable review, \"Here's a film for adults. It's also about time to recognize that Mr. Ivory is one of our finest directors, something that critics tend to overlook because most of his films have been literary adaptations.\"[16]\n\nThe film was named one of the best films of 1993 by over 50 critics, making it the fifth-most-acclaimed film of 1993.[17]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film grossed $23 million in the United States and Canada.[2] In the United Kingdom, it grossed £4.5 million.[18] Worldwide, it grossed $63.9 million.[2]\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n| Award                                             | Category

It doesn't surprise me.' ... Pinter's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer, but that in such a case he could withdraw his name (which is exactly the case with [the film] The Remains of the Day—he had insisted on this clause since the bad experience with revisions made to his Handmaid's Tale script); he has never been given any reason as to why another writer was brought in\" (Gale 352).\n- ^ \nHudgins adds:  \"We did not see Pinter's name up in lights when Lyne's Lolita finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13 [1995] letter [to Hudgins] to state that 'I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer,' again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the Remains of the Day situation\" (125).\n- ^ Cf. the essay on the film The Remains of the Day published in Gale's collection by Edward T. Jones: \"Pinter gave me a copy of his typescript for his screenplay, which he revised 24 January 1991, during an interview that I conducted with him in London about his screenplay in May 1992, part of which appeared in 'Harold Pinter: A Conversation' in Literature/Film Quarterly, XXI (1993): 2–9. In that interview, Pinter mentioned that Ishiguro liked the screenplay that he had scripted for a proposed film version of the novel. All references to Pinter's screenplay in the text [of Jones's essay] are to this unpublished manuscript\" (107n1).\n- ^ \nIn his 2008 essay published in The Pinter Review, Hudgins discusses further details about why \"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed film scripts, The Handmaid's Tale, The Remains of the Day and Lolita,\" all of which Hudgins considers \"masterful film scripts\" of \"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\"; fortunately (\"We can thank our various lucky stars\"), he says, \"these Pinter film scripts are now available not only in private collections but also in the Pinter Archive at the British Library\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \"examin[es] all three unpublished film scripts in conjunction with one another\" and \"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\" (132).\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"The Remains of the Day\".

Their past employer, the Earl of Darlington, has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed by his pre–Second World War support of Nazi Germany, and his stately country house has been sold to retired US Congressman Jack Lewis. Allowed to borrow the Daimler, Stevens sets off for the West Country to see Miss Kenton for the first time in decades.\n        In the 1930s, Kenton arrives at Darlington Hall, where the ever-efficient but deeply repressed Stevens derives his entire identity from his profession. He butts heads with the warmer, strong-willed Kenton, particularly when he refuses to acknowledge that his father, now an under-butler, is no longer able to perform his duties.\n        Displaying total professionalism, Stevens carries on as his father lies dying during Darlington's conference of like-minded fascist-sympathising British and European aristocrats. Also in attendance is U.S. Congressman Lewis, who admonishes the \"gentleman politicians\" as meddling amateurs, advising that \"Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik\" and warning of impending disaster.\n        Exposed to Nazi racial laws, Darlington gets Stevens to dismiss two newly hired refugee German-Jewish maids. Kenton threatens to resign but has nowhere to go, and a regretful Darlington is later unable to rehire the maids. At another conference, Stevens is unable to answer an aristocratic guest's questions on global trade and politics, which the aristocrat claims demonstrates the lower classes' ignorance and inability to govern themselves.\n        Relations thaw between Stevens and Kenton, and she clearly shows her feelings for him. But the outwardly detached Stevens remains dedicated solely to his role as butler. She catches him reading a romance novel, which he explains is to improve his vocabulary, asking her not to invade his privacy again.\n        Lord Darlington's godson, journalist Reginald Cardinal, arrives on the day of a secret meeting at Darlington Hall between the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the German ambassador, Joachim von Ribbentrop. Appalled by his godfather's role in seeking appeasement for Nazi Germany, Cardinal tells Stevens that Darlington is being used by the Nazis, but Stevens feels it is not his place to judge his employer.\n        Kenton forms a relationship with former co-worker Tom Benn and accepts his proposal of marriage. She informs Stevens as an ultimatum, but he will not admit his feelings and only offers his congratulations. Finding her crying, his only response is to call her attention to a neglected domestic task, and she leaves Darlington Hall before the start of the Second World War.\n        En route to meeting Kenton in 1958, Stevens is mistaken for a gentleman at a pub. Doctor Carlisle, a local GP, helps him refuel the Daimler, deduces that he is actually a manservant, and asks his thoughts about Lord Darlington's actions. Initially denying having even met him, Stevens later admits to having served and respected him, noting that Darlington later confessed that his Nazi sympathies had been misguided and naive.\n        Stevens tells Carlisle that, although Lord Darlington was unable to correct his error, he is attempting to correct his own. He meets Kenton, who has separated from her husband and is staying at a boarding house on the coast. She and Stevens discuss how Lord Darlington died from a broken heart after suing a newspaper for libel, losing the suit and his reputation. Stevens mentions that Cardinal was killed in the war.\n        Kenton declines to resume her position at Darlington Hall, wishing to remain near her pregnant daughter and, despite years of unhappiness, thinking about going back to her husband. Stevens supposes they may never meet again, and they part fondly but are both quietly upset, with Miss Kenton visibly tearful as her bus pulls away.\n        Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, where Lewis asks if he remembers what he had said at the conference in the 30s. Stevens replies that he was too busy serving to listen to the speeches. A pigeon flies into the fireplace from the chimney, and Lewis catches and sets it free. Stevens watches the bird as it flies away, leaving Darlington Hall far behind.\n    </PlotSummary>\n    <Themes>Social class, Duty, Regret, Historical reflection</Themes>\n    <IntensityLevel>Moderate</IntensityLevel>\n    <SpaceSetting>No</SpaceSetting>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n\n\n### Summary\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes of the `MovieRecommendation` class.

This is saying a lot, as this time in cinema brought a huge amount of growth, innovation and storytelling that hadn’t been seen in films from a previous era (as shown in such films as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Amores Perros and Memento). What interested me about this film and what has more than definitely sparked the attention of a myriad of viewers is the overall simplicity of it. While it was marketed as a comedy, most people would argue that the film veers fairly far away from that genre, instead bringing a classification wholly of its own. The picture’s languid take on storytelling makes it markedly different from most other narrative films. The story is carried squarely on the shoulders of its characters, and it becomes clear that without them, there would truly be no film whatsoever.\n\nBob (the wonderfully charming Bill Murray) and Charlotte (a young and stunning Scarlett Johansson) are both literally lost in translation within the greater confines of Tokyo, Japan. The two of them are guests at the Park Hyatt Tokyo in Shinjuku, one of the city’s most bustling wards. Even though the hotel is located in the middle of it all, the sights and sounds of the great city become muted within the building’s walls.\n\nOur protagonists are both Americans abroad in Japan for the first time and the language barrier is quite distinct and hard to overcome. While some fragmented splices of conversation are translated for them, they are mostly left on their own in terms of dealing with the difference in language. The film’s title frames this perfectly by showing how these two people are disconnected not only from their foreign surroundings, but also from the people in their lives and are in search of a more meaningful form of communication with someone new.\n\nCharlotte is staying at the hotel with her husband, a fairly eminent entertainment photographer who knows a bit of Japanese and is never around. So when Charlotte finds Bob, she finally discovers the connection that she needed all along in this unfamiliar city. Bob feels the same way, albeit in a different light, as he comes from another situation entirely.\n\nJust recently having graduated with a philosophy degree from Yale, Charlotte is new to being married and out of college. On the other hand, Bob is a seasoned veteran of the married life. His wife and family are back home in California, and it’s apparent that Bob has become estranged from them. He and his wife have a series of strained telephone conversations throughout the film, and his young daughter doesn’t feel like speaking to him over the phone. Bob feels lost, as he is detached from these people he calls his family. Charlotte is also lost. She’s lost sight of who she is and who her husband is, as she feels like he has become a different person in the short amount of time they have been abroad. She wants to feel something, and she does feel something once she gets to know Bob well.The narrative of this film is not a love story, nor should it be thought of as a love story. It is about two people in need of a different sort of human connection than they’d ever had before and about how profound a relationship like this can be. As a backdrop, the city of Tokyo adds a dimension to this relationship. The city is framed in such a way that doesn’t just put it into the background of the characters’ situations, but rather in the foreground. The whole city is used: from a variety of gaming arcades and a vast metro network, to sushi restaurants, nightclubs and karaoke bars.\n\nLost In Translation has been my favorite film since I was 13 years old. It deals with so many concepts, and it’s not possible to realize just how profound it is until it’s been watched multiple times. I’ve sat through roughly 20 viewings of the film at this point, and it never gets old. I always find little details and tidbits that, without which, the story’s arc and meaning would have fallen apart. It’s these small, but hugely necessary elements that make a great work of cinematic art. And it doesn’t hurt that Coppola’s Academy Award-winning screenplay for the film is absolutely stellar. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered another script that is rife with so much subtext. What is said in three words carries the weight of 30 words. When Bob tells his wife that he’s “lost,” all the underlying themes of the film come to light and a sense of true existentialism in Coppola’s writing is revealed. Everything has meaning in this film, and it really enforces how much depth the little things in life have.\n\nSofia Coppola, in her writing and directing of this film, presents a portrait of a young artist highly skilled beyond her years. She works with the medium in lovely ways, enhancing the texture of the cinematography and scoring the film with an innovative soundtrack, utilizing such famed indie artists as Air and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Even though Coppola hails from a storied legacy of filmmaking greats that give her significant monetary contributions most other independent filmmakers lack, I would still regard Coppola as a trendsetter in the indie movement. Lost in Translation’s handheld cinematography, for instance, is reminiscent of earlier independent films of the 90’s in that Coppola entered public spaces with easy-to-maneuver equipment that allowed for efficiency while also promoting a singular artistic vision. Sofia Coppola proves through her techniques that female filmmakers can be just as powerful, if not more so, than their male counterparts.\n\nI’m hoping to enter the film industry at some point in my life, and this film has more than certainly cemented my passion for the art of filmmaking and my understanding of how it can change lives. Sofia Coppola is one of my greatest inspirations as a female artist. She should be a prominent figure for any woman either in or interested in the entertainment industry, as she is a strong-willed person who has stories that need to be told. Coppola is more than driven to get her narratives out to the world, and she accomplishes this as a woman in a very male-centric field.\n\nLost in Translation is an inspirational film, if anything. It has proven to me that connecting with others is worthwhile, regardless of the situation presented. Even though Bob and Charlotte likely won’t be able to communicate after they leave Tokyo, what they shared there is real and that is what matters. The film has shown me a new way of seeing the world, and with this fresh outlook, I know that it is a beautiful place.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n- More\n\n- Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n# Post navigation\n\n## One thought on “Lost in Translation”\n\n- feedingbrett says: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDecember 9, 2015 at 8:21 pm\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nHaley this is an outstanding review!\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nΔ\n\n# Archives\n\n- January 2020\n- July 2019\n- June 2019\n- May 2019\n- April 2019\n- March 2019\n- February 2019\n- January 2019\n- December 2018\n- November 2018\n- October 2018\n- September 2018\n- August 2018\n- June 2018\n- May 2018\n- April 2018\n- March 2018\n- February 2018\n- January 2018\n- December 2017\n- November 2017\n- October 2017\n- September 2017\n- August 2017\n- July 2017\n- June 2017\n- May 2017\n- April 2017\n- March 2017\n- February 2017\n- January 2017\n- December 2016\n- November 2016\n- October 2016\n- September 2016\n- August 2016\n- July 2016\n- June 2016\n- May 2016\n- April 2016\n- March 2016\n- February 2016\n- January 2016\n- December 2015\n- November 2015\n- October 2015\n- September 2015\n- August 2015\n- July 2015\n- April 2015\n\n# Meta\n\n- Register\n- Log in\n\n- Comment\n- Reblog\n- Subscribe Subscribed\n    - Filmic\n    - Join 47 other subscribers\n    - Already have a WordPress.com account?

When a film like this comes along, it reassures me that film is indeed the greatest art form of our time. Movies that had that awe-inspiring effect on me include: “Last Year At Marienbad”, “The Exterminating Angel”, “Persona”, “2001: A Space Odyssey”, “Dark City”, “Enter the Void”, “The Thin Red Line”, “Eyes Wide Shut” and “Synecdoche, New York”. I like to call them life-changers.\n\nThe first time I watched Michael Gondry’s “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” it felt like a life changer. I remember the night I saw it, too. I couldn’t sleep all night due to perpetual thoughts rushing through my head. I used to experience that during the last minutes of an exam I couldn’t finish on time. That night, I needed more time to grasp the film’s brilliant originality and fascinating implications. The second time I saw it, I had a few friends over and it wasn’t as impressive. Now, six years later I’ve given it another shot. Surprisingly, it had that same initial effect on me. This almost never happens to me, and I think I understand why it enchanted me the first and last times. It is one of those rare films, I’d rather watch alone than with an audience.\n\nIt reaches for something personal like troubling memories buried deep in our psyche. It is a film that demands the presence of thoughts we put aside when surrounded by people, things we only think about when we’re alone, buried in everlasting thoughts. “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” is the rarest of all films, a therapeutically liberating work of art.\n\nCharlie Kauffman’s marvelous screenplay revolves around Joel (Jim Carrey), a soloist stuck in the repetitive formula of everyday life till he meets the spontaneously carefree Clementine (Kate Winslet). Their relationship escalates into a supposedly dead-end when he learns that she had him erased from her memory. Furious and confused, he contacts the inventor of this advanced process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson). Out of sheer desperation he resorts to the only logical solution at the time, removing her from his memory as well. But as he re-experiences the passionate days of their earlier relationship, he falls in love with her all over again.\n\nThe film then takes a Hitchcockian turn and becomes a man-on-the run film, only this time the protagonists are running from an untouchable entity. They race from one memory to the next desperately escaping the inevitable erasing process. It’s one of the most original and fresh ideas ever shot on film. If you haven’t seen this modern masterpiece, I strongly suggest you stop reading at this point, as I will explore some of the film’s more thought provoking themes.\n\nOne of the philosophical questions this film asks is whether we are merely the sum of our memories or if there’s more to us than a summation of past experiences. Would erasing an incident from our micro-history do us any good? Would a woman erasing the memory of a rape make her happier or would removing the incident do more damage to her life than the actual incident itself? Hence, she wouldn’t have learned anything from it or become the stronger person she is today. Is ignorance indeed bliss?\n\nThe film ultimately arrives to the conclusion that no, having a spotless mind does not bring eternal sunshine. You may forget a past memory but you can’t forget the impulses, instincts and emotions that arose from that past incident. They are in some sense untouchable because they shape who we are. Take for example, the simultaneous subplot involving Mary (Kirsten Dunst) discovering that she had her love affair with Dr. Mierzwaik erased. She arrives to that discovery through her love to him. The weak link in Lacuna’s process is that it successfully erases memories but can’t erase feelings.\n\nAnother heartbreaking scene that explores the system’s imperfection is when Joel and Clementine finally bid farewell inside his head. She leans in and whispers, “Meet me in Montauk.” You see, the Clementine guiding his escape is merely a projection in Joel’s mind. She represents his will to hold on and he does so through what he knows of her spontaneous personality.\n\nWhen they challenge the erasing process by hiding in childhood remembrances and other “off the map” memories, the escape route is always suggested by Clementine. Joel would never arrive to such conclusions himself, but he subconsciously asks himself what would Clementine do and acts upon it. So when she whispers that final line inside his head, what he’s really doing is implanting an impulse; something Lacuna can’t touch.\n\nThe film opens with a post-erasing scene. On Valentine Day, Joel feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working and there he meets Clementine. She too implanted that impulse during her erasing process and it’s such a beautiful encounter. That cold day on the beach, they fall for each other all over again. Both Joel and Clementine do in fact win at the end, implanting that impulse defeats the system in a final attempt of desperation.\n\nIn that “second” first encounter, it’s almost like a hidden magnetic force pulls them together. This is portrayed cinematically through brilliant use of music. Music plays when they talk and pauses when they pause. Joel and Clementine click in a disguised coincidence, a natural encounter.\n\nIn another simultaneous subplot, Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians, uses the dialogue he knows from Joel and Clementine’s real initial encounter to sweep her off her feet. The plan backfires on him and only fuels her confusion and anger. I believe that we as human beings have an uncanny ability to detect bullshit and truth in words. We think spoken words is the only way of communicating but there’s an invisible energy that comes from body language, the way we say things, and the way we look at a person that tells us if there’s any truth in what is being communicated. This energy is something beyond what we hear or see; it’s something we feel, a feeling of truth.\n\nMy favorite scene in the film is when they’re stuck in their first memory, which is also the last memory they helplessly witness getting erased. Both characters recite some of the dialogue of his memory, but occasionally, Joel becomes self aware, looks at Clementine and pours out his commentary thoughts. As they sit in front of the ocean, she looks at him and says, “This is it Joel, it’s gonna be gone soon.” A sad smile eclipses his face when he replies, “I know.” But it’s the last exchange that really hit the mark with me. “What do we do?” she asks. To which he replies, “Enjoy it.” Joel gives up fighting instantly and chooses to enjoy the little time they have left together and it’s utterly heartbreaking.\n\nIronically, this reminded me of one of my childhood memories with my dad who’s a doctor of nuclear medicine; it’s when they use nuclear energy in a positive way to cure cancer. I remember when he told me that not all cancer patients choose to fight the disease and there’s nothing he can do about that, it’s their call. As a young kid, I couldn’t get that through my head. It just seemed inconceivable at the time. Whatever reasons they may have, I think it’s their right to do so. Whether it’s never-ending surgeries that constantly fail or hectic chemotherapy that leaves them miserable in their potential last days, it’s their right to let go and enjoy the little time they have left in this world.\n\nLetting go is one of the hardest things a person can do. It doesn’t mean they’re giving up, it means they’re moving on. We hold on to things we value as if they will cease to exist when we let go. The truth is they won’t. Letting go or giving up isn’t an act of cowardice; quite often it’s an act of supreme bravery. “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” tells us to accept things as they are and make the most of what we have when all hope is lost.\n\nI remember seeing my dad sitting on the living room couch as he watched the news. He’s one of the most positive and cheerful people I know and it often puzzled me knowing what he does for a living. I asked him if dealing with dying people on a daily basis is a depressing job. He replied something along the lines of “We tend to keep a lighthearted environment at the hospital.” When I asked him if breaking the bad news is the worst part of his job, he told me that it was, but every once in a while he breaks out great news and it makes it all worth it. The ups and down of life apply everywhere. In the case of this film, it’s in a relationship. As Joel discovers throughout his mental journey, the ups are sometimes worth all the downs.\n\n“Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean, Tears from the depths of some devine despair Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, In looking on the happy autumn fields, And thinking of the days that are no more.” – Alfred Tennyson\n\nAfter a break up, the very memories you once cherished, the ones that drew a smile on your face whenever you remembered them seem none existent. That’s probably due to the recently bad incident towering and blocking all things wonderful from your thoughts. I think it’s an act of self-preservation to let the bad memories stick and allow great ones to slip through our fingers. It makes moving on easier.\n\n“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,  I took the one less traveled by And that has made all the difference.” – Robert Frost\n\nAfter Joel and Clementine learn they’ve had their memories erased because things just didn’t work out, they somehow choose to travel that same road again anyway. I think it’s a perfect ending to a perfect film. As we’re so often told, it’s about the journey not the destination. They know what is waiting at the end of that road and they choose to walk through it anyway. The journey has been erased and therefore, they choose to re-experience it. Perhaps it’s to arrive at that conclusion because that’s the only way they’ll understand the nature of their previous destination. Or maybe, they share a tiny ounce of mutual hope. After all, they know the pitfalls and hidden traps on that road from listening to their Lacuna tapes. Dodging them is all that needs to be done to arrive at a different destination. This is precisely how second chances are meant to be taken.\n\nWhenever, I watch this film it steers my eyes away from the empty half of the glass of water and makes me acknowledge that there’s a full half right below. For that very reason, I’m eternally grateful for its existence.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Twitter\n- Facebook\n\n## Post navigation\n\n## 115 thoughts on “Film Analysis: “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind””\n\n- Pingback: Poster Fan Art: “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” « The Cinephile Fix .children\n- Pingback:\n    - Chris Martin says: .comment-author November 23, 2014 at 12:34 am .comment-metadata .comment-meta Dear writer, I’m not very good at this stuff, as much as I love to think I can write I can’t.

It is a story that shows the pain of a toxic relationship and the struggle of trying to move on from someone, but with a twist. The reality this movie is set in has a program that people can go through to have their memories of a person completely erased. This is something that all people, at some point, wish was actually available. However, it is better to learn and grow from these bad memories and apply these lessons to later experiences in life. This can be seen as Joel Barish spends the whole movie trying to stop his erasing process of Clementine as it happens. As most people who dated in high school, my first relationship was not successful and I used to wish it never happened. Just as Joel and Clementine started out strong, passionate, and madly in love, so did I and my ex boyfriend. As time grew on, we began to make each other angry more often than happy, but we did not realize that our resentment of each other should have been enough to make us either work things out, or call it quits. Instead, we stayed unhappy for years while claiming that we were in love. This idea of comfort in an unhealthy relationship was shown in the beginning of the movie, where they had gotten used to constantly bickering and hating each other’s company. Since we were in a relationship as toxic as Joel and Clementine’s, we, too, eventually came to an end. Despite not enjoying each other as people, we still both took it hard. It was something that I could not get over for months, and I constantly found myself wishing he never existed, that I never met him, or that we never dated. The heartbreak seemed like a burden I would have to carry until I died and it did not seem worth it in the slightest. I know that if I had the opportunity presented in the movie that I would have not even thought twice about having my memories of him erased. It was not until after I had accepted and moved on from the past that I realized that relationship was a necessary life experience that would help me for years to come. As Joel’s memories of Clementine begin to erase he realizes that he wants to keep them. I think that he probably pinpoints where things went wrong and assumed that he could prevent them from turning sour once again. I think that although he wanted his memories of her to help get her back, it would still be a lesson either way. Whether things turned out with Clementine or not, he could always apply everything he learned to his life and next experiences. Although it would be nice to be able to get another chance, or start with a blank slate, sometimes all we can do is make sure that something like that never happens again. After having several months, and then years, of reflecting on my first relationship, I learned how to implement everything that happened into my present and future. First and foremost, I looked inward. Instead of getting upset about what I could have done differently, I realized what I needed to do next time I was with someone. I also learned what I should not do. Not only that, though, I also gained a lot of insight on how I should be treated. Besides making me more confident, it made me see how respectfully and properly a guy is supposed to treat me to earn and maintain my interest. Without having this negative of a relationship, I would have still had to experience trial and error somehow, sometime, in order to figure out what works well for me and what makes me work well for other people. I think that this movie touched me so much because I could so heavily understand the pain of a break up and the desire to never have to think or deal with it again. However, I can also understand why it is important to keep these painful memories and turn them into something positive. Life is not always easy, and sometimes we are dealt a bad hand and we have to ride it out, but that does not mean that things will permanently be negative. We are given obstacles to learn how to overcome them, not to simply never try and face them again. With every challenge we encounter, we have to remember that the struggle is temporary but the lesson we learn will be incredibly fulfilling.

It is a bittersweet story, and I find them the most memorable.  “Erasing” all of Joel’s memories of Clementine meant he would never have access to the good ones.  In most periods of my life, I have found it is the good ones that linger.\nA similar approach was taken in the first “Kicking and Screaming” with Josh Hamilton and Oliva d’Abo.  In this case, their relationship was run in reverse, through flashbacks, until the scene where they first got together was the last one in the film.  It sticks with you forever just like the scene you most remember from “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” where Joel and Clementine say goodbye in the beach house as it “deconstructs” around them.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- gingerbear says: \n\nOctober 15, 2013 at 1:44 am \n\n\nI have just watched this film for the first time and boy did I not expect what I saw.

The line “Meet me in Montauk” I couldn’t quite articulate how that exactly worked out, but you nailed it. Same with the impulses and raw emotions attached to memories, and those raw feelings cannot be erased. Human chemistry really seems to have no science behind it, too many variables. I slightly have different views on some things. Patrick freaked Clem out b/c I believe those words still had emotional impulses attached deep down. Even if Patrick meant all those words, and really liked her, she already formed a connection w/ someone else speaking them. She freaked out b/c she only knew this subconsciously. If she just felt it was insincere, I don’t believe she would’ve freaked out so harshly. The words were pulling her back to past impulses which she couldn’t understand. Also spot on: it’s best to watch alone. I’ve enjoyed it with my girlfriend, but it reaches my deepest core of sadness, regret, shame, joy, and love when alone. In a way, I think something like this would only strengthen a relationship. If you hear such harsh words after investing a long time with someone, it’s devastating. But, if you just met someone and heard these words supposedly spoken, it would have less impact b/c the emotional bonds haven’t been formed yet. It’s much easier to avoid stepping back into that pitfall when you know how hurtful you can be. It’s the ability to see a future that was, so you can make a future that could and should be.

No other review came close to explaining all the concepts this film presented, as well as bringing up new ideas. It really makes you think… it makes you ponder life deeply…. and I’m not trying to be philosophical, but this is one of the few movies (in fact, the only movie) that hits my core so hard. As I watched it alone, I can’t compare how it would feel different to watch with other people, but I can already agree 100%. This kind of movie is perfect for self-reflection, and personally allowed me to establish a small connection with my own memories and how I interact with them sometimes. Makes me realize just now amazing our minds really are.\nAgain, thanks so much for answering every single one of my once-lingering questions.

And yes I highly agree that erasing a memory does mean that you’ll eventually do it again and you won’t learn from it.

A new friend of mine adores this movie and (trusting her judgement) I finally watched it last night (twice). That hesitant moment in the end when Clem says she will end up feeling trapped again and Joel simply responds “Okay.”- it was beautiful. To me, that was supreme bravery. My past is riddled with dark and lengthy periods I would have gladly erased…but today I am happy. Memories make me…\nAs a side note, I’ve never been more excited to Google a movie after it ended.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- Demetri Georgatsos says: .comment-author April 15, 2014 at 6:22 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta I really loved your review and insight on the film.

I just stood looking at my DVD rack for inspiration and out it came.\n I doubt there are many people who have watched this film and not had the debate with themselves (or others)..if you could, would you erase the person who broke your heart?  Would it make you happier?  Would the trade off be worthwhile?  There are lots of great things about this film, but for me that best part is the way it makes you think, and analyse, and debate the answer.  This film is ten years old now and still years ahead of its time.  Great film – and great review.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- Tom Johnson says: \n\nAugust 11, 2014 at 6:01 pm \n\n\nWonderfully written.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- fix garage door opener says: .comment-author August 21, 2014 at 1:53 am .comment-metadata .comment-meta Neat blog!

However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.\nWell, if you’re familiar with Kaufman’s work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself “What the hell is going on?”, but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I’m glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel’s head.\nIf you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.\nBut if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that’s beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he’s smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman’s writing is always clever, but this time he’s one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but ‘Eternal Sunshine’ manages to dazzle you with it’s originality and it’s poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.\nMichel Gondry’s use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. \nEternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of “Best of 2004”.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- jose rodriguez says: \n\nSeptember 25, 2014 at 5:13 pm \n\n\nive watched this one twice. When I was alone and 17 years old with some friends. 10 years later I watched with my partner. I cried a lot, everything starts clicking in your mind, the fights, the good moments, the great moments all the way to the first moment, to the first time we met. We chose the same spot if that ever happens to us, similar to Montauk. For some reason, it seemed that while he was dreaming and running from the erasors, the awakend recently erased Clem was somehow being told by Joel not to believe in Elija Wood character lies through some kind of telepathy. If not, how is it that they met in the train that exact day? At the end this question is left to open interpretation, which makes the movie excellent for watching it again every 5 years or so with your partner.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- Wendy says: \n\nNovember 5, 2014 at 1:29 pm \n\n\nAmazing and beautifully written review of this film. I recently re watched it for the first time in years and I’m blown away by the work of the actors, the concept, and the story line!! All beautiful ..I really enjoyed your review of the film. The movie does go to show how we can’t erase feelings ..memories of good times are hard to swallow when the person you cared for is now out of your life. However , you touched on this statement “accept things as they are and make the most of what we have when all hope is lost.” And it just stuck a cord with me …it’s true we must just focus on making the most out of life’s experiences even painful ones …moving on doesn’t mean that relationship wasn’t important or that you quit it just means your stronger for being able to keep going and move through the pain.\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- gs says: \n\nNovember 21, 2014 at 10:35 pm \n\n\nAmazing\nLikeLike\n\nReply\n- atulm2m says: .comment-author November 23, 2014 at 8:26 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta This is beautifully written analysis of Eternal Sunshine I must say.

I can’t wait to witness her reaction to this brilliant &amp;amp; bewildering experience, which is one of the towering achievements in all of film. \nI first saw it when I was still recovering from the loss of my “first love”. We had split up after a year and had 6 months of bliss &amp;amp; 6 months of hell, all wrapped up into one life-changing relationship. For so long I had focused on the bad moments that led to our downfall, but this movie changed that…\nJoel’s last scene spoke VOLUMES to me by implying a simple message: the good times are worth the bad. Loving someone and creating lifelong memories is more important than the bad times that come with a breakup. It’s the experience, the journey that matters. Joel implied as much and I instantly had an epiphany that helped me finally accept what happened and move on with my life.\nAnyway, your review is perhaps the best I’ve read in describing the true meaning of this movie.

            "spanned_content": "<movieRecommendation>\n    <name>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</name>\n    <director>Michael Gondry</director>\n    <plotSummary>\n        The film revolves around Joel (Jim Carrey), a soloist stuck in the repetitive formula of everyday life until he meets the spontaneously carefree Clementine (Kate Winslet). Their relationship escalates into a supposedly dead-end when he learns that she had him erased from her memory. Furious and confused, he contacts the inventor of this advanced process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson). Out of sheer desperation, he resorts to the only logical solution at the time, removing her from his memory as well. But as he re-experiences the passionate days of their earlier relationship, he falls in love with her all over again.\n    </plotSummary>\n    <themes>\n        One of the philosophical questions this film asks is whether we are merely the sum of our memories or if there’s more to us than a summation of past experiences. Would erasing an incident from our micro-history do us any good? Would a woman erasing the memory of a rape make her happier, or would removing the incident do more damage to her life than the actual incident itself? Hence, she wouldn’t have learned anything from it or become the stronger person she is today. Is ignorance indeed bliss?\n    </themes>\n    <additionalInformation>\n        The film ultimately arrives at the conclusion that no, having a spotless mind does not bring eternal sunshine. You may forget a past memory, but you can’t forget the impulses, instincts, and emotions that arose from that past incident. They are, in some sense, untouchable because they shape who we are. The film is a therapeutically liberating work of art that challenges viewers to accept things as they are and make the most of what we have when all hope is lost.\n    </additionalInformation>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the key elements of the original article are preserved while making it more readable and organized.

Visit trylon.org for tickets and more information.\n\nMinor spoilers for the film Stardust included.\n\nSince the dawn of time—which began either in a rural Tennessee farmhouse or a rented duplex in Milwaukee—I have been a movie person. My early childhood memories overlap with scenes from A Bug’s Life, A Night at the Opera, and Air Bud. Some of the fondest moments of my youth were the Friday nights we spent as a family watching a movie—locked in time, sharing a cinematic experience for the first (or second or fifth) time. We watched old classics, movies my parents loved, and poorly animated cash grabs for children. I probably owe my parents some therapy for the number of times they had to watch Anne Hathaway’s Hoodwinked. In any case, although I didn’t consciously center my personality around film, it was a core tenant of my grubby little seven to eight-year-old identity. Movies were my window to the rest of the world.\n\nOur household was big on fantasy films. We loved The Princess Bride, obviously, but also Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Ella Enchanted. Fantasy films expanded the horizon of storytelling; the rules of reality were different. In between the Christian allegories and the tween literary adaptations were stories about marginalized communities winning their freedom, women fighting for their autonomy, and families finding each other. Fantasy stories were about identity, youth, and free will, each one of them unique and vibrant.\n\nSo oh my god, why can’t I remember ever watching Stardust?\n\nYou have to understand, my parents both love this movie. I confirmed it before I started this essay. My mother claims to have watched it multiple times, but I can’t remember it at all. For years, I held onto the memory of a strange little movie with a unicorn as a side character. I recall a fondness for the film, but little else. When the Trylon’s programming schedule was released, I was thrilled to revisit this hidden gem from when I was a kid. But after watching it for this essay, I don’t know if I’ve ever seen it before.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPictured: my parents confirming in text messages that they both love Stardust, as well as my mother admitting she threw out my Teletubbies VHS tapes.\n\nRevisiting my childhood and Stardust simultaneously feels serendipitous, given the film’s central themes of youth and aging. It’s a whimsical reimaging of Neil Gaiman’s much darker novel, which itself is an adaptation of a DC Comics mini-series. Compared by Gaiman himself to It Happened One Night, Stardust is both a romance movie and a coming-of-age story. It follows Tristan (played by an adorable pre-Daredevil Charlie Cox) as he attempts to capture a star so he can win over village girl Victoria (Sienna Miller). On his journey, he encounters the star’s corporeal form Yvaine (Claire Danes), who, unbeknownst to either of them, is being hunted by the witch Lamia (our lord and savior Michelle Pfeiffer) and Prince Septimus (our other lord and savior Mark Strong). While Septimus is seeking out the star so he can retrieve a ruby and take control of the kingdom, Lamia has a much darker intent: eat Yvaine’s heart and gain eternal youth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere is tension between Tristan’s growing up story and Lamia’s desire to regain her youth. The witch believes her power is rooted in being young and not in the wisdom she’s gained while aging. Nor is it rooted in the connection she has with her sisters; they do not value each other, just the magic they possess and the promise of becoming beautiful again. They argue frequently throughout the film, and eventually, all die in their vain quest to become young again. Tristan, on the other hand, grows more confident as he embarks on his perilous journey. As he grows into himself, Tristan discovers the importance of love and family. He learns to stand up for himself, figuratively and literally, and while Lamia cannot accept growing old, Tristian learns to embrace it by the end of the film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStardust does a great job of depicting themes like aging through a childlike lens—a skill I attribute to both its genre and the mastermind behind the story (not only Gaiman, but also director Matthew Vaughn). The fantasy genre provides creators with an opportunity to break down difficult ideas into magical, easy-to-understand stories for younger audiences. In contrast to its rather graphic source material, the Stardust film treats the darker parts of the story with levity and whimsy. Not only does that effort make the film more family-friendly; it helps break down difficult concepts like aging and death. The subplot about Septimus and his fratricidal brothers is lightened by their ghosts, who are eternally stuck in whatever form they were killed in (including the brother who’s half-flattened after being pushed out a window). Death is not gruesome; instead, it is made into something lighthearted and easier for a child to understand. Similarly, the film ends with Tristan and Yvaine ascending to the sky to become stars. There is magic and beauty in their metaphorical passing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutside of its handling of tough concepts, Stardust is a movie built on childhood wonder. In between the main conflict and character desires is a world of imagination: a fantastical realm where royals have blue blood and candles can fly you skyward, witches can turn you into small mammals, and kings can knock a star out of the sky with a pendant. England’s considered fiction. There’s a unicorn. Stardust looks at the world the way a child would, all while addressing the importance of growing up.\n\nGiven how much Stardust has in common with the other fantasy films I watched as a kid, I’m choosing to believe that it really is the unicorn movie of my memories. Even if I didn’t relive the wonder of watching it when I was younger, there’s a certain magic in experiencing that kind of childhood whimsy. For a moment, I was living in that world, flying on an airborne pirate ship alongside the main characters. I look forward to revisiting it again—maybe when I’m older and well on my way to ascending to the stars.\n\nEdited by Olga Tchepikova-Treon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n, , , , , , .\n\n### One Comment\n\n- The Mom \n\n\t\t\t\t\tApril 21, 2023 at 11:52 am \n \n\n\nThey were LOST.

            "spanned_content": "Now, I will rewrite the article while inserting the appropriate XML tags.\n\n\n\n<article>\n    <header>\n        <title>Stardust and the Quest for Childhood Wonder</title>\n        <author>Finn Odum</author>\n    </header>\n    \n    <section>\n        <Name>Stardust</Name> plays at the Trylon Cinema from Friday, April 28 through Sunday, April 30. Visit trylon.org for tickets and more information.\n\n        Minor spoilers for the film <Name>Stardust</Name> included.\n\n        Since the dawn of time—which began either in a rural Tennessee farmhouse or a rented duplex in Milwaukee—I have been a movie person. My early childhood memories overlap with scenes from A Bug’s Life, A Night at the Opera, and Air Bud. Some of the fondest moments of my youth were the Friday nights we spent as a family watching a movie—locked in time, sharing a cinematic experience for the first (or second or fifth) time. We watched old classics, movies my parents loved, and poorly animated cash grabs for children. I probably owe my parents some therapy for the number of times they had to watch Anne Hathaway’s Hoodwinked. In any case, although I didn’t consciously center my personality around film, it was a core tenant of my grubby little seven to eight-year-old identity. Movies were my window to the rest of the world.\n\n        Our household was big on fantasy films. We loved The Princess Bride, obviously, but also Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Ella Enchanted. Fantasy films expanded the horizon of storytelling; the rules of reality were different. In between the Christian allegories and the tween literary adaptations were stories about marginalized communities winning their freedom, women fighting for their autonomy, and families finding each other. Fantasy stories were about identity, youth, and free will, each one of them unique and vibrant.\n\n        So oh my god, why can’t I remember ever watching <Name>Stardust</Name>?\n\n        You have to understand, my parents both love this movie. I confirmed it before I started this essay. My mother claims to have watched it multiple times, but I can’t remember it at all. For years, I held onto the memory of a strange little movie with a unicorn as a side character. I recall a fondness for the film, but little else. When the Trylon’s programming schedule was released, I was thrilled to revisit this hidden gem from when I was a kid. But after watching it for this essay, I don’t know if I’ve ever seen it before.\n\n        Revisiting my childhood and <Name>Stardust</Name> simultaneously feels serendipitous, given the film’s central themes of <Themes>youth and aging</Themes>. It’s a whimsical reimaging of Neil Gaiman’s much darker novel, which itself is an adaptation of a DC Comics mini-series. Compared by Gaiman himself to It Happened One Night, <Name>Stardust</Name> is both a <Genre>romance</Genre> movie and a <Genre>coming-of-age story</Genre>. It follows Tristan (played by an adorable pre-Daredevil Charlie Cox) as he attempts to capture a star so he can win over village girl Victoria (Sienna Miller). On his journey, he encounters the star’s corporeal form Yvaine (Claire Danes), who, unbeknownst to either of them, is being hunted by the witch Lamia (our lord and savior Michelle Pfeiffer) and Prince Septimus (our other lord and savior Mark Strong). While Septimus is seeking out the star so he can retrieve a ruby and take control of the kingdom, Lamia has a much darker intent: eat Yvaine’s heart and gain eternal youth.\n\n        There is tension between Tristan’s growing up story and Lamia’s desire to regain her youth. The witch believes her power is rooted in being young and not in the wisdom she’s gained while aging. Nor is it rooted in the connection she has with her sisters; they do not value each other, just the magic they possess and the promise of becoming beautiful again. They argue frequently throughout the film, and eventually, all die in their vain quest to become young again. Tristan, on the other hand, grows more confident as he embarks on his perilous journey. As he grows into himself, Tristan discovers the importance of love and family. He learns to stand up for himself, figuratively and literally, and while Lamia cannot accept growing old, Tristan learns to embrace it by the end of the film.\n\n        <Name>Stardust</Name> does a great job of depicting themes like <Themes>aging</Themes> through a childlike lens—a skill I attribute to both its genre and the mastermind behind the story (not only Gaiman, but also director <Director>Matthew Vaughn</Director>).

Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. The film also features Stephen Tobolowsky, Brian Doyle-Murray, Marita Geraghty, Angela Paton, Rick Ducommun, Rick Overton, and Robin Duke in supporting roles.\n\nRubin conceived the outline of Groundhog Day in the early 1990s. He wrote it as a spec script to gain meetings with producers for other work. It eventually came to the attention of Ramis, who worked with Rubin to make his idea less dark in tone and more palatable to a general audience by enhancing the comedy. After being cast, Murray clashed with Ramis over the script; Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements, whereas Ramis concentrated on the comedic aspects. Principal photography took place from March to June 1992, almost entirely in Woodstock, Illinois. Filming was difficult, in part because of bitterly cold weather but also because of the ongoing conflict between Ramis and Murray.\n\nGroundhog Day was a box-office success on its release, earning over $105 million to become one of the highest-grossing films of 1993. It also received generally positive reviews. Reviewers were consistent in praise for the film's successful melding of highly sentimental and deeply cynical moments, and for the philosophical message beneath the comedy. It received multiple award nominations and won a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay. For all its success, the film marked the end of Ramis's and Murray's long collaborative partnership, which had produced films like Caddyshack (1980) and Ghostbusters (1984). After filming ended, the pair did not speak to each other until shortly before Ramis's death in 2014. The film was a showcase for Murray; he had previously been seen primarily as a comic actor, and his performance led to more serious roles in critically acclaimed films.\n\nIn the years since its release, the film has grown in esteem; it is often considered to be among the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the greatest comedy films ever made. It has also had a significant effect on popular culture: the term Groundhog Day, meaning a monotonous, unpleasant, and repetitive situation, has become part of the English lexicon. Buddhist, Christian, and Jewish scholars have analyzed the film as a religious allegory. Groundhog Day is also credited with having ushered in mainstream acceptance of comedy films with fantasy-genre elements. In 2006, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry. Groundhog Day was adapted into a 2016 musical, and inspired a 2019 video game sequel, Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son.\n\n## Plot\n\nOn February 1, cynical television weatherman Phil Connors reassures his Pittsburgh viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss Western Pennsylvania. Alongside his new producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry, Phil travels to Punxsutawney for his annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festivities. He makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there, asserting that he will soon be leaving his station for a new job.\n\nA private home in Woodstock, Illinois was used for exteriors of the Cherry Street Inn, the fictional location in which Phil awakens every morning in the film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn February 2, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn to Sonny &amp; Cher's \"I Got You Babe\" playing on the clock radio. He gives a half-hearted report on the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil and the festivities. Contrary to his prediction, the blizzard strikes the area, preventing all travel out of Punxsutawney, and although he desperately searches for a way to leave, he is forced to spend the night in the town.\n\nThe next morning, Phil wakes once more to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio in his room at the Cherry Street Inn. Phil experiences the previous day's events repeating exactly and believes he is experiencing déjà vu. He again unsuccessfully attempts to leave the town and retires to bed. When he awakes, it is again February 2. Phil gradually realizes that he is trapped in a time loop of which no one else is aware. He confides his situation to Rita, who directs him to a neurologist, who in turn directs him to a psychologist; neither can explain his experiences. Phil gets drunk with locals Gus and Ralph and then leads police on a high-speed car chase before being arrested and imprisoned; the next morning, Phil awakens in the Cherry Street Inn once again.\n\nRealizing that there are no consequences for his actions, Phil begins to spend loops indulging in binge eating, one-night stands, robbery, and other dangerous activities, using his increasing knowledge of the day's events and the town's residents to manipulate circumstances to his advantage. Eventually, he focuses on seducing the sweet-natured Rita, using the loops to learn more about and manipulate her. No matter what steps he takes, Rita rebuffs his advances, particularly when Phil tells her he loves her; Rita asserts that he does not even know her.\n\nPhil gradually becomes depressed and desperate for a way to escape the loop. He commits suicide in a variety of ways, even kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil and driving them both off a cliff. Each time, he reawakens on February 2 to \"I Got You Babe\". He eventually tries to explain his situation to Rita again, using his detailed knowledge of the day to accurately predict events. Convinced, Rita spends the rest of that day's loop with Phil; she encourages him to think of the loops as a blessing instead of a curse. As they lie on the bed together at night, Phil realizes that his feelings for Rita have become sincere. He wakes alone on February 2. Phil decides to use his knowledge of the loop to change himself and others: he saves people from deadly accidents and misfortunes and learns to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French. Regardless of his positive actions, however, he is haunted by his inability to prevent a homeless old man from dying of natural causes.\n\nDuring one iteration of the loop, Phil reports on the Groundhog Day festivities with such eloquence that other news crews stop working to listen to his speech, amazing Rita. Phil continues his day helping the people of Punxsutawney. That night, Rita witnesses Phil's expert piano-playing as the adoring townsfolk regale her with stories of his good deeds earlier that day. Impressed by his apparent overnight transformation, Rita successfully bids for him at a charity bachelor auction. Phil carves an ice sculpture in Rita's image and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is trapped in the loop forever, he is finally happy because he loves her. They share a kiss and retire to Phil's room.\n\nPhil wakes the next morning to \"I Got You Babe\", but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter has changed; it is now February 3. He tells Rita he wants to live in Punxsutawney with her.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(left) in 1989, and  in 2003\n\n- Bill Murray as Phil Connors\n- Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson\n- Chris Elliott as Larry the cameraman\n- Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson\n- Brian Doyle-Murray as Buster Green\n- Marita Geraghty as Nancy Taylor\n- Angela Paton as Mrs. Lancaster\n- Rick Ducommun as Gus\n- Rick Overton as Ralph\n- Robin Duke as Doris the waitress\n\nIn addition to the main cast, Groundhog Day features Ken Hudson Campbell as the man in the hotel hallway, David Pasquesi as Phil's psychiatrist, and Richard Henzel and Rob Riley as the radio hosts waking Phil every morning.

He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985).[3][4][5] Rubin began musing about vampiric immortality and what one would do with their time if it was limitless. He reasoned that vampires were like normal people who did not need to adhere to ordinary rules or moral boundaries.[4][5] He questioned if and when immortality would become boring or pointless, and how a person would change over time, especially if they were incapable of substantial change.[4] He singled out men he deemed to be in arrested development, who could not outlive their adolescence.[4][5]\n\nHaving recently sold his first script for what would become the thriller film Hear No Evil (1993), his agent prompted him to develop a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with producers. Rubin began work on his idea of a man changing over eternal life, but quickly realized that the idea was impractical because of the expense of depicting historical and future events. At this point, Rubin recalled a brief story concept he had written two years earlier that followed a man who woke every morning to find it was the same day repeating. Rubin married the two ideas to create the outline for Groundhog Day. By portraying eternity as a repeating cycle instead of a straight line through history, he eliminated the production cost of constantly changing settings.[4] He believed that the repetition also offered him more dramatic and comedic possibilities.[5]\n\nRubin opened a calendar and picked the next nearest holiday, February 2, Groundhog Day. He saw it as a date with story potential because it was a recognized holiday without much widespread attention. Rubin believed that people were vaguely aware of the holiday, on which a groundhog predicts the coming of spring. Even so, he believed few people outside Pennsylvania were aware that the actual festival takes place in the small town of Punxsutawney, something he became aware of through a writing job for a local phone company.[4] Setting the story in Punxsutawney provided a small area in which to trap Phil Connors, while reporting on the event gave the character a reason to visit. Rubin took the main character's name from Punxsutawney Phil.[4] He hoped the film could become a perennial holiday favorite, like It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965).[6][7][8]\n\nRubin spent eight weeks working on the story: seven making notes to define the rules and characters, and one writing the script.[4][5] He struggled to establish a cause for the time loop, considering technological, magical, and celestial origins. He considered these methods interchangeable and felt the cause was unimportant and could detract from the story elements he wanted to focus on. Rubin said that the lack of explanation made Phil's situation more relatable, as \"none of us knows exactly how we got stuck here either.\"[4] He chose to begin the story in medias res, with Phil already caught in the time loop.[4] The first scene included Phil waking to \"I Got You Babe,\" predicting the radio host banter and the actions of the hotel patrons, and attacking a pedestrian outside. Rubin thought this would intrigue an audience trying to understand how and why he is doing these things.[5] He chose \"I Got You Babe\" because it used a lot of repeating lines and was about love, which he felt were thematically resonant aspects.[9] He likened his original script to the 1949 British black comedy film Kind Hearts and Coronets, particularly the flippant way in which Phil's multiple suicides are shown.[4]\n\nRubin did not initially write the film as a broad comedy, considering it more whimsical. He found that the funnier elements were the easiest to think of; one of the earliest scenes he wrote was about Phil using his ever-increasing knowledge to seduce women.[5] Loops were also dedicated to Phil seeing how far he could get outside of Punxsutawney; inevitably, he was always returned to the town.[10] Even so, the script focused much more on Phil's loneliness. He breaks the loop only after realizing that there are other lonely people and that he can do good deeds to make them happier. Scenes in the finished film happened much earlier in Rubin's script, such as Phil driving over a cliff. The passage of time was also more distinct; Phil would track it by reading one page of a book per day, reaching his low point when he realizes he has run out of books. The original ending also featured a twist: Phil breaks his loop and then confesses his love to Rita. The perspective then becomes Rita's; she rejects Phil's advance because she is not ready for love and gets trapped in a loop of her own.[3]\n\n### Development\n\nDirector and writer Harold Ramis in 2009\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRubin's agent used the script to arrange meetings with producers; although it did not sell, the meetings generated other work for him.[4][5] In 1991, after his agent left the industry, Rubin distributed the Groundhog Day script in an effort to secure a new representative. It came to the attention of Richard Lovett at Creative Arts Agency.[5][11] Lovett said that he could not represent Rubin, but passed the script to his own client, Harold Ramis.[5]\n\nBy the early 1990s, Ramis had begun moving away from involvement in the anti-establishment and anti-institutional comedies, such as Caddyshack (1980) and National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), that had defined his earlier career.[7][11] While Ramis had successes in front of the camera and in creative roles like writing, his last directorial effort, Club Paradise (1986), had been a critical and commercial failure.[12][13][14] He wanted to direct an unusual project and was particularly interested in comedies about redemption and discovering one's purpose in life.[7][11] Rubin was aware of Ramis's previous work, having watched him in film and television.[4]\n\nRamis admitted that he did not laugh while reading Rubin's script. He was interested in the underlying spirituality and romance present, but thought it needed more humor.[12] The pair discussed the core ideas in the script, raising parallels between it and the concepts of Buddhism and reincarnation.[4] They also discussed whether it was ethical for Superman—a superhuman being with the power to save the lives of countless people and prevent disasters—to effectively waste time on adventures with his partner Lois Lane.[4][12]\n\nRubin's script became the subject of two offers: one arranged by Ramis through Columbia Pictures that would grant his project a higher budget, but at the cost of creative control, and a smaller independent studio that offered a lower budget of $3 million, but would let Rubin retain his original concept. Rubin chose to go with Ramis's deal. As expected, the studio wanted changes.[3]\n\n### Writing\n\nRubin admitted to becoming defensive about the studio's changes. He was concerned that they would remove what he saw as innovative plot points and turn it into a generic comedy film.[4] Ramis supervised the rewrite,[12] tasked with balancing Rubin's desire for originality and the studio's demand for a broad comedy.[3] The pair loosely used the Kübler-Ross model of the five stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—as an outline.[15][12] Ramis imagined himself in Phil's situation and the things he would do and feel if in the same cycle of entrapment.[12] The pair spent weeks revising the script.[6] Ramis suggested that Rubin's original ending, with Rita trapped in her own loop, be removed. He felt that audiences would dislike this as it offered no catharsis.[11][16] Similarly, he felt it was important to retain the story's darker elements, such as Phil's suicides, as these compensated for the necessary sentimental moments.[12]\n\nRubin delivered a fresh draft on February 2, 1991.[3] He was contractually permitted to write another draft, but the studio had Ramis take over, bringing Rubin's involvement to an end.[17] Ramis took Rubin's new draft and began his solo rewrite.[4][3] He found the sentimentality and sincerity completely opposed to everything he had learned to do as a comedian, and deliberately tempered the sweeter moments with a cynical and grouchy tone.[12] Ramis reorganized the script into a mainstream three-act narrative.[18] He emphasized Phil's smug attitude as a means of distancing himself from others, giving him a defined story arc as a classic comedic lead character deserving of his punishment.[7][11] Ramis liked Rubin's concept of starting with the loop in progress, but associate producer Whitney White suggested starting the film before the loop begins because she thought it would be more interesting for the audience to see Phil's initial reaction to his predicament.[19][20]\n\nRamis also removed Rita's boyfriend, Max, and introduced (then removed) Phil's executive producer, Gil Hawley.[21] This draft featured more scenes focused on Phil's sexual conquests[22] and removed some content deemed more mean-spirited, like Phil asking Rita to be his \"love slave.\" The situation was reversed in the final version of the film, in which Rita buys Phil at the bachelor auction, claiming that she owns him.[21] Phil's journeys outside Punxsutawney were excised, as Ramis did not want the audience becoming too focused on what the rules of the loop were and felt that keeping the story within the town made it more claustrophobic.[23] Phil's expositional narration was removed as well.[4][20] Also excised were more scenes of Phil's later good deeds and the clever methods he used to prevent accidents while making the most efficient use of his time. For example, Phil puts a large rock in a road to stop a truck delivering fish, on which a restaurant patron would have later choked.[24] Where Rubin's original script had been more sermonic and deprecating, Ramis made the tone more optimistic.[19][11] Two versions of a scene with Phil and Rita in a diner from Rubin's original script and Ramis's rewrite exemplify the shift of emphasis toward both Phil's smugness and the romantic core of the film:[7][11]\n\nIt was Ramis's version that attracted Murray to the project, though Murray and Ramis immediately clashed over its tone. Murray wanted to focus on the philosophical elements; Ramis countered that it was meant to be a comedy.[3][11][21] The studio was happier with Ramis's draft, believing that his changes made it more appealing to audiences.[3] Columbia Pictures rehired Rubin to assess the script and provide notes. Rubin returned the script with pages of honest and sometimes sarcastic notes. In response, Murray recommended fully rehiring Rubin to assist on the script.[25]\n\nThe studio refused to greenlight the project without making explicit why Phil becomes trapped.[4][19] Producer Trevor Albert described a Columbia executive saying, \"Why does the day repeat?... I like it... but I don't understand why he gets stuck in this loop.\"[19] Rubin had conceived of several causes for the loop, including a jilted lover placing a curse on Phil and a mad scientist's invention malfunctioning.[19] Albert and Ramis worked with Rubin to appease the studio, while agreeing to place the scenes too late in the shooting schedule to be filmed—and if forced to shoot it, to simply not include it in the film.[19]\n\nAs the conflict between Ramis and Murray continued, Ramis sent Rubin to work on the script with Murray; he believed it was the only way to stop Murray's constant early-morning phone calls. When Ramis called to check on their progress, Murray asked Rubin to pretend he was not there.[3][11] The pair visited the 1992 Punxsutawney Groundhog Day festival to get a better understanding of the event, remaining discreet and not revealing the reason for their visit.[26][27] They then spent weeks working together in New York City revising the script.[6][28] Rubin found Murray's more laid-back approach to writing \"frustrating.\"[29] They were still working on the script a month before filming began, bringing it back closer to Rubin's original.[3]\n\nRubin and Ramis then collaborated on an additional rewrite. The pair worked on individual sections and then edited each other. Ramis then spent a few days refining it into the screenplay.[3][4] Rubin recommended that they not include any references to the 1990s or any specific period to allow it to remain timeless.[29][30] Rubin has said that the final film largely resembles his script.[12] He did regret the loss of a scene between Phil and a 14-year-old boy, in which the child behaves like Phil did at the start of the film, contrasting with Phil's character development by that point in the script.[31] A few scenes were written but not filmed, including Phil praying at a church, gambling, and a scene Murray personally vetoed, of Phil stripped naked to force an elderly man out of a swimming pool.[3][12] Although the script was complete, it continued to undergo changes during filming.[32][33]\n\n### Casting\n\nChris Elliott (pictured in 2011) portrays Larry the cameraman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the role of Phil Connors, Chevy Chase, Tom Hanks, and Michael Keaton were also considered.[34][35][36] Hanks was Ramis's first choice, but he rejected the offer, rationalizing that he was typecast portraying nice people, and the audience would be expecting his inevitable redemption, whereas Murray was \"such a miserable [son of a bitch] on- and off-screen\" that the outcome would be less predictable. Keaton said that the role of a \"wry, sardonic, glib\" character was a typical role for him, but that he simply did not understand the film. He later confessed regret in passing on the role.[35][36] Phil was written as a younger man, but this was changed when it was determined that the appropriate comic actors were all older.[37]\n\nMurray and Ramis had a longstanding friendship and collaborative relationship, having worked together since 1974 on many projects and five films to great success, including Meatballs (1979), Caddyshack, and Ghostbusters (1984).[11][18] Rubin did not write the character as particularly nasty, aiming for a normal person in an extranormal situation. In casting Murray, Phil was portrayed as more cynical, sarcastic, and detached, but not so malicious that audiences would no longer support him.[38] Rubin wanted Kevin Kline for the part, believing Murray did not have the necessary acting ability.[39] Ramis reassured Rubin, saying, \"Don't worry. This is what Bill Murray can do. He can be that nasty and still make you like him.\" MacDowell agreed, saying \"He's a jerk but he makes you laugh.\"[38]\n\nAlbert auditioned comedians for the role of Rita, but determined that someone competing with Murray at comedy would be detrimental. Rita was not intended to trade witty comments with Phil, but instead to offer human warmth and intelligence. MacDowell was cast because she was thought to bring an effortless grace suited to Rita's character. MacDowell tried to adapt to Murray's natural improvisation in scenes. She believed that her character's humor comes from her honesty, without being outlandish.[38] Singer Tori Amos was also considered for the role.[40]\n\nTobolowsky was hired after delivering an \"overwhelmingly obnoxious\" portrayal during his audition.[41] Michael Shannon, who portrays prospective groom Fred, made his on-screen acting debut in the film. He spent much of the shoot in the background of the diner scene as they wanted all the actors in their places even if the camera was not focused on them.[42] A live groundhog, given the name Scooter, was used to portray Punxsutawney Phil. Punxsutawney officials, upset that their town was not used for filming, refused to allow the real Punxsutawney Phil to appear in the film.[16][43] The groundhog itself was not specially bred for use on film and was trapped in the wild near Illinois a few weeks before filming.[27]\n\n### Preproduction\n\nThe real Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania (2012)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe production wanted to use a \"quintessential American town\" for location shooting, a place that did not look as if it was specific to any particular period.[7] The Pennsylvania Film Commission provided location scouting tapes of Punxsutawney, but it became obvious that attempting to film in Punxsutawney would present difficulties, as the town had few ideal filming locations for the scripted scenes.[7][27] Punxsutawney was also too isolated from the necessary amenities. The rural town was nearly 80 miles (130 km) from Pittsburgh, the nearest large city and did not offer sufficient accommodation for the entire cast and crew.[27][44]\n\nAs a Chicago native, Ramis enjoyed filming in Illinois and knew the area could meet their needs.[7][27] These included being closer to a major metropolitan area with access to highways, a winter aesthetic, and the ability to complete the production as quickly as possible.[27][44] Ramis also wanted a main street like Punxsutawney's. Location scout Bob Hudgins thought that Mineral Point, Wisconsin, could meet their requirements. During the scouting journey there, the team stopped in the city of Baraboo, Wisconsin, which happened to have a town square. The filmmakers could see the benefits of a town square over a main street. Ramis asked for something similar, but in closer proximity to Chicago.[45]\n\nBy the time they arrived in Woodstock, Illinois, over 60 towns had been scouted. Hudgins was aware of Woodstock—a small town of approximately 25,000 people—from his work on the 1987 comedy film Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Though relatively remote, it offered the timeless quality the filmmakers sought. After Hudgins arranged for Ramis and Albert to view the town from the bell tower of the Woodstock Opera House, the decision was made to film in Woodstock.[27][45] The town even came with a large pothole for Phil to step in.[7][45]\n\nScouts initially found a forested preserve area outside of McHenry, Illinois, to film scenes at Gobbler's Knob. The filmmakers later opted to position the site in the town square instead,[45] recreating it to scale with detailed notes and videos,[7][27][44] which significantly increased the effect on the town. Thousands of extras were on site across multiple takes. Several local businesses banded together to oppose the film's presence, concerned about the influence the production would have on both the town square and storefronts over an indeterminate amount of time. Hudgins said that he was proud that badges with the number \"23\" on them—representing the 23 united businesses—had to be amended to \"14\" as he won several over. The city council was also split on whether to let it proceed.[45] Three of the business owners sued Columbia Pictures after filming concluded for lost profits during the production. One of these cases was settled out of court; the outcomes of the other two are unknown.[46]\n\n### Filming\n\nTip Top Bistro, established at the site of the fictional Tip Top Cafe in Woodstock\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 16, 1992, and concluded on June 10, after 86 days.[47] The budget was reported to be between $14.6 million and $30 million.[1][27][48] Filming took place mainly in Woodstock, as well as on sets in Cary, Illinois, and Hollywood.[27][49]\n\nWeather conditions varied considerably during filming. Much of the shoot was conducted in conditions described as frigid and bitterly cold.[7] Murray estimated that it was often 20 °F (−7 °C). The conditions persisted until the end of May. Murray said that being outside for up to 12 hours a day left his skin feeling raw and made him irritable.[27] Toward the end of the shoot, as summer began, fake snow was used to replicate the winter setting, and the actors continued to wear their winter gear despite the rising heat.[42] Ramis could not decide on the weather conditions for the background of Phil's and Ned's encounters, so he shot their nine scenes multiple times in differing conditions. He settled on a gloomy setting to indicate a loop coming to an end.[7] Weather conditions were a major factor in a two-week shoot for the car crash scene.[50]\n\nThe shoot was also mired in tensions between Ramis and Murray; Ramis was focused on making a romantic comedy, in direct contrast to Murray's desire for a more contemplative film.[7][51] Murray was also in the middle of a divorce from Margaret Kelly.[12] He was reportedly miserable throughout filming, demonstrated erratic behavior, threw tantrums, and often contradicted Ramis's decisions.[18][51] Ramis said that Murray constantly showed up late to set, calling his behavior \"just irrationally mean and unavailable.\"[51] The two also disagreed about the script and other actors' performances.[12] Shannon recounted how he believed he had upset Murray during an encounter. When Ramis heard about this, he made Murray publicly apologize to Shannon.[42] Tobolowsky recounted how before their scene's first take, Murray walked into a bakery and bought all the pastries, which he threw to the gathered onlookers, using Tobolowsky to help carry the load.[33]\n\nThe Woodstock Opera House served as both the exterior of Rita's hotel and the scene of one of Phil's suicides.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe script continued to change during filming. When Tobolowsky arrived for his first scene, he was handed a new script. He estimated that about a third of it was different from his original copy. For example, early in the film, Phil ends his first loop by breaking a pencil to see if it is repaired the following day. A more elaborate scene was filmed in which Phil spray-painted the walls of the room he wakes up in, destroyed objects, and gave himself a Mohawk hairstyle. The scene took three days to film and was costly; Ramis discarded it for something quieter, simpler, and less manic. The revised script also featured more of Phil's misadventures, and his suicide attempts were set closer to the end. These scenes were moved forward in favor of a long third act showing Phil embracing life.[32][33]\n\nMurray endured physical discomfort for some scenes. To prepare for his step into the water-filled pothole, he wrapped his foot in cling wrap, neoprene, and two pairs of socks. As soon as the scene finished, he began an expletive-filled rant until the costume department dried his foot with hairdryers to avoid frostbite.[7] For another scene, Murray asked MacDowell to really slap him, and Ramis instructed the children Murray confronts in a snowball fight to throw hard.[38][51] During the scene in which Phil drives off with Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog bit Murray on the knuckle. Although Murray was wearing gloves, the bite broke the skin. During a later take, the groundhog bit him again, in the same spot.[43][16]\n\nMurray was hesitant about shooting the final scene in which Phil awakens next to Rita, as how or whether Phil was dressed would affect the tone of the revelation that he had escaped the time loop. Ramis polled the crew, who were split between Phil wearing the same clothes as the previous night and different clothes that suggested the pair had been intimate.[7] A young female crew member served as the tiebreaker, ruling that they should be wearing the same clothes as \"anything else... will ruin the movie.\"[7] As MacDowell's and Murray's characters venture outside the Cherry Street Inn in the film's denouement, the scripted line \"Let's live here\" is tempered by a Murray ad lib, \"We'll rent to start.\"[52]\n\nMany locations in and around Woodstock were used in the production. The Woodstock Town Square features prominently. A bar in the former courthouse is used for a bar in Rita's hotel. The Woodstock Opera House served as the exteriors of Rita's hotel, and its tower is used for Phil's suicide leap.[49][53] The Cherry Street Inn was a private residence; the interior was shot on a set.[49] Woodstock City Lanes was used for the bowling alley scene.[53] The Tip Top Cafe, a setting for several scenes, was purpose-built for the film. Local demand later led to a real diner with a near-identical name at the same location.[53][54] The bachelor auction where Phil demonstrates his personal transformation was filmed at the Woodstock Moose Lodge.[49][53] The shots of Murray being nearly run over by a train were filmed at the nearby Illinois Railway Museum.[55][56][57] The scene of Phil driving a truck over a cliff was shot in Nimtz Quarry in Loves Park, Illinois, about 34 miles (55 km) from Woodstock. A rail system was used to propel two vehicles into the quarry on separate takes, to give Ramis a choice of shots; pyrotechnics were employed to make each explode.[50]\n\n## Release\n\n### Context\n\nThe premiere of Groundhog Day took place on February 4, 1993, at the Fox Theater, Westwood Village in Westwood, Los Angeles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1993 was considered the year of the family film.[58] This was seen as a response to criticism of Hollywood for overusing violence and sex in films, as well as a need for feel-good entertainment in a time of recession.[59][60] As production costs rose, films pitched at both adults and children offered a greater chance being profitable both at the theater and in the ensuing home video rentals. By 1993, the three all-time highest-grossing films in North America were family-oriented: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Star Wars, and Home Alone. Family films encouraged repeat business and offered more opportunities to sell merchandise.[59][60] Columbia Pictures chairman Mark Canton said that PG-rated films were much more likely to make over $100 million, compared to adult-oriented fare. Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission. The film was seen as a potential sleeper success.[61][62]\n\nGroundhog Day was one of many family films released that year, including Free Willy, Last Action Hero, and the highly anticipated Jurassic Park, which would go on to become the highest-grossing film to date.[63] Not all releases that year were family-centric; it would become considered one of the greatest years for film across a range of genres.[64][65] There were blockbusters like Mrs. Doubtfire and Indecent Proposal, critical favorites such as Schindler's List and Philadelphia,[66][65][67] and future classics, like Dazed and Confused, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and The Nightmare Before Christmas.[67][68][69]\n\nThe premiere of Groundhog Day took place on February 4, 1993, at the Fox Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. Murray did not attend the low-budget event, whose guests included comedian Rodney Dangerfield and actresses Catherine O'Hara, Mimi Rogers, and Virginia Madsen. $40,000 of the entry ticket sales profits were donated to the Scleroderma Research Foundation and Turning Point Shelter.[70] A second premiere took place the following day in Crystal Lake, Illinois, followed by an auction of props and signed equipment from the film. All proceeds were donated to the Woodstock school district.[46]\n\n### Box office\n\nIn North America, Groundhog Day received a wide release on February 12, 1993, across 1,640 theaters. The film earned $12.5 million—an average of $7,632 per theater. The film benefited from a four-day weekend due to the President's Day holiday Monday. This increased its weekend total to $14.6 million—enhancing the theater average to $8,934. This made it the second-biggest opening for a film released in winter, behind Wayne's World ($18 million) released the year before. Groundhog Day finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of romantic drama Sommersby ($9.9 million), and adventure comedy Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey ($8.1 million), both in their second week of release.[71][72][73] Screenings of the film were approximately 80% sold out. 65% of audiences polled said they would \"definitely recommend\" it.[74]\n\nThe film retained the number-one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $9.3 million.[75] In its third weekend, it dropped to second place with $7.6 million, behind the debuting crime thriller Falling Down ($8.7 million).[71][76] Groundhog Day remained in the top 10 grossing films for a further four weeks, earning a total of $57.6 million. It spent the remainder of its run outside the top 10 apart from two brief resurgences—one during the long Easter weekend in mid-April where it rose to number 2, and approximately 15 weeks into its run, where it rose to number 7 after being released in low-price ticket theaters.[71][77][78]\n\nIn total, the film earned an approximate box office gross of $70.9 million.[48] Though it did not break any records, the film was considered a success, if a modest one.[30][79][80] It finished as the 10th highest-grossing film of 1993 behind Free Willy ($78 million) and Cliffhanger ($84 million).[58] When accounting for films released at the end of 1993 that earned most of their box office in 1994, Groundhog Day becomes the 14th highest-grossing film of 1993.[66] Industry experts suggest that as of 1997, the box office returns to the studio—minus the theaters' share—was $32.5 million.[81] Outside of North America, the film is estimated to have earned a further $34.2 million, giving it a cumulative worldwide gross of $105 million and making it the 19th highest-grossing film of the year worldwide.[48][82][83]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical reception\n\nStephen Tobolowsky in 2012. His portrayal of insurance-selling \"pest\" Ned Ryerson was well received.[84][85]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroundhog Day received generally positive reviews from critics.[86] CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers gave it an average rating of \"B+\" on a scale of A+ to F.[87]\n\nIt was seen as a significant change from the previous works of Murray and Ramis.[88] Kenneth Turan appreciated it as a gentle, endearing, and smaller-scale film.[88] Hal Hinson called it the best American comedy since 1982's Tootsie (also featuring Murray). He said that Groundhog Day demonstrated Ramis's capable comedic timing, and offered a clever plot without pretension.[89] Critics compared it to a combination of It's a Wonderful Life and the surreal science-fiction/horror television series The Twilight Zone (1959).[85][89][90] Roger Ebert compared it to the Murray-starring Christmas-comedy Scrooged (1988), featuring a similar transformation from selfish to selfless. He said that where that film offered a \"grim discontent,\" Groundhog Day offered optimism.[91]\n\nCritics agreed that the film had an obvious moral, but disagreed on its presentation. Desson Thomson found the film initially intriguing but believed it deteriorated into a Hollywood-style morality tale.[92] In Turan's opinion, Groundhog Day started as a traditional Hollywood story, but was earnest enough to convert the audience by the end, and had a \"romantic innocence\" that prevented it becoming formulaic.[88] Hinson said that the moral core of the story was never presented in a way that insulted the viewer's intelligence or required they sacrifice their cynicism to accept it. He continued that Phil evolves into a better version of himself, but never stops being a jerk.[89] According to Janet Maslin, the film balanced sentimentality and nihilism.[85] The Hollywood Reporter appreciated that the film endorsed small town morals and their positive effect on Phil.[90] The New Statesman argued that it appealed simultaneously to cynicism and optimism.[93]\n\nThe tone was described as inconsistent, and the film poorly paced, some scenes going on too long.[84] Owen Glieberman compared it unfavorably to another time-travel film, Back to the Future (1985), which he found more cleverly structured. He described some scenes as isolated comedy sketches rather than part of a larger narrative.[94] Thomson said that the repetition of scenes worked against the film, making it seem as if no progress was being made.[92] Hinson countered that minor alterations to the scenes kept them interesting as part of a \"brilliantly imaginative\" and \"complex\" script.[89] Some reviewers said that the humor was often mild, eliciting small chuckles instead of outright hilarity,[94][85] although Hinson found it to be \"wildly funny.\"[89] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it offered a range of comedy and satire, all tempered by the love story between Phil and Rita.[90] Critics highlighted the deeper story behind the comedy. Ebert called it a comedy on the surface but with an underlying thoughtfulness.[91] Maslin said that her initial impression was of a lightweight fare, but it became \"strangely affecting.\"[85]\n\nMurray was consistently praised for his performance.[84][88][89][92] Critics were in agreement that his performance was essential to the film's success by making Phil's transformation believable.[84][85][95] Gene Siskel wrote that any other actor could not have prevented the film from becoming too \"saccharine.\"[95] Turan said that Murray's natural gruffness and comedic barbs prevented over-sentimentality. Turan also appreciated the endearing performance by Murray compared to his more abrasive, past performances.[88] Hinson said that Murray had never been funnier. He continued that Murray was a vital component in keeping the film's optimism from seeming dishonest or manufactured. Hinson liked that even after Phil's redemption, he retains a cynical edge.[89] Glieberman believed that Murray's indifference retains the audience's attention, but added that while Murray was talented enough to play a redeemed person, it was not a good fit for him.[94] Ebert found Murray significantly funnier as a sarcastic antagonist than the friendly protagonist.[91]\n\nCritics were enamored with MacDowell's performance. Siskel said that she lit up the screen when she was on.[95] Maslin called her a \"thorough delight,\" saying that MacDowell's performance offered a comforting, comedic presence.[85] Hinson said that the on-screen chemistry between MacDowell and Murray was \"otherworldly\" and that she was a perfect fit for comedy.[89] Tobolowsky also received praise as a hilarious \"pest.\"[84][85]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 1993 New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the screenplay came runner-up for Best Screenplay, tying with Schindler's List.[96] The same year, it won Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards.[97] In a then-unprecedented move, in late 1993, Columbia Pictures sent over 4,500 members of the Academy Awards voting committee a custom box containing videotapes of nine of their eligible films. The campaign was estimated to have cost between $400,000 and $650,000. Groundhog Day was included among these nine films,[98][99] but received no nominations at the 66th Academy Awards.[100]\n\nAt the 1994 BAFTA Awards, Rubin and Ramis won the award for Best Original Screenplay.[101] MacDowell won the award for Best Actress at the 20th Saturn Awards ceremony, where Groundhog Day also received nominations for Best Fantasy Film (losing to The Nightmare Before Christmas), Bill Murray for Best Actor (losing to Robert Downey Jr. in Heart and Souls), Best Writing and Best Direction (losing both to Jurassic Park), and Best Costumes for Jennifer Butler (losing to Hocus Pocus).[102] At the American Comedy Awards, Murray and Elliott were nominated for, respectively, Funniest Actor and Funniest Supporting Actor.[103] The film was nominated for Best Dramatic Presentation at the Hugo Awards, losing to Jurassic Park.[104]\n\n## Post-release\n\n### Aftermath\n\nAuthor Richard A. Lupoff threatened legal action against the filmmakers, alleging that they had copied his own time loop-based story \"12:01 P.M.\"\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite its relative success, a sequel was ruled out by November 1993.[105] Groundhog Day was one of the films credited with helping to reverse Columbia's failures at the box office, alongside the 1992 films Bram Stoker's Dracula, A Few Good Men and A League of Their Own.[106] Shortly after its release, author Richard A. Lupoff threatened legal action against the filmmakers, alleging the film copied his short story \"12:01 P.M.\" and its associated 1990 short film adaptation about a man stuck in a time loop. The case was never formally filed as the film's production company refused to support legal action.[6][107] Similarly, author Leon Arden attempted legal action, claiming the film plagiarized his novel One Fine Day, which he had unsuccessfully pitched as a script to Columbia Pictures, about a man repeating April 15. The judge ruled against Arden.[107][108]\n\nMurray initially hated the finished Groundhog Day.[51] In a 1993 interview, he said that he wanted to focus on the comedy and the underlying theme of people repeating their lives out of fear of change. Ramis wanted to focus on the redeeming power of love. Even so, Murray agreed that Ramis had ultimately been right to do so.[43] The film marked the end of Ramis and Murray's nearly 20-year long partnership that among other things, had created films like Caddyshack, Stripes (1981), and Ghostbusters. After filming concluded, Murray stopped speaking to Ramis. He never contacted Ramis, and refused to speak about him in interviews.[11] Ramis openly spoke about Murray, both criticizing him and discussing his dreams where the pair were once again friends.[18][51] Some of their close acquaintances, including producer Michael Shamberg, speculated that Murray had grown disillusioned with the assumption that his best work only came in collaboration with Ramis, or that Ramis was responsible for Murray's public persona.[11][18] Ramis said that he could make Murray as funny as possible, and in return, Murray's improvisational skills could save even the most lackluster of scripts.[18]\n\nMurray felt that Groundhog Day had given him an opportunity to showcase a different side of himself. He admitted that he was bothered by his perception that his previous films focused on jokes without offering a deeper subtext. Even so, he said that he had found solace in meeting the people entertained by his work.[43] Ramis believed that Murray's dramatic turns in films like Lost in Translation (2003) revealed more about Murray than anything else. Speaking in 2009, Ramis said that he thought Murray had grown tired of being the manic, energetic person carrying a film, and wanted to explore his potential.[109] Ramis reached out to Murray to cast him in his 2005 black comedy The Ice Harvest. Murray's brother Brian declined on his behalf. When Ramis enquired further, Brian said that Murray never discussed Ramis. Except for a few brief exchanges at public events, the pair did not speak for nearly two decades.[11] They reunited only in the final few months of Ramis's life in 2014.[7][110] Rubin said that Murray and his brother now speak fondly of Ramis.[7]\n\nRubin was in high demand as a screenwriter but retained his desire to tell original stories and refused to tell a traditional Hollywood narrative arc, as he found defying the expected premise and structure the most interesting part. He said that studios wanted him to simply put his spin on a conventional story. Eventually, the offers stopped coming. He continued to write scripts, but none progressed. In a 2017 interview, Rubin admitted some regret that Groundhog Day remained his biggest success.[6]\n\n### Home media and rereleases\n\nGroundhog Day was released on VHS in early September 1993. It debuted at number 11 on the VHS rental chart, rising to number 1 by the end of September, replacing Falling Down.[111][112][113] It remained the number 1 rental until mid-October when it was knocked off the top spot by Point of No Return at number 2 and Aladdin at number 1.[114][115] It was considered the most successful comedy release of late 1993.[116]\n\nThe film was released on DVD in 1998.[117] The 2002 \"Special Edition\" DVD included the film's trailers, an audio commentary by Ramis, and The Weight of Time—a behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of the film, featuring cast and crew interviews.[118][119] Murray did not participate.[120] A 15th-anniversary edition DVD was released in January 2008.[121] The film was digitally remastered under Ramis's supervision. This set included Ramis' audio commentary and The Weight of Time, and added an interview with Ramis, a short documentary on groundhogs, and deleted scenes.[119][120][122] This version was later released on Blu-ray disc in 2009, with an additional picture-in-picture feature with Tobolowsky reprising his role as Ned to provide facts about the film.[123]\n\nTo celebrate the film's 25th anniversary in February 2018, a remastered 4k resolution version of the film was released in select theaters.[124] In April 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented a special one-night screening of the remastered film at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California.[125] The remastered version was also released as an Ultra HD Blu-ray disc, Blu-ray disc, and a digital download. It included the same extras as the 15th-anniversary edition.[119]\n\nTo celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, the film was released in select theaters for two days in February 2023, with one of those days being February 2, Groundhog Day.[126]\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Time loop duration\n\nThe duration of Phil's real-time entrapment in the time loop has been the subject of much discussion.[35][127] Ramis once said that he believed the film took place over ten years.[35] When a blogger estimated the actual length to be approximately nine years, Ramis disputed that estimate and his own. He replied that it takes at least 10 years to become good at an activity (such as Phil learning ice sculpting and to speak French) and \"allotting for the down-time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years.\"[128] A similar estimate suggests that it takes at least 10,000 hours of study (just over a year's worth of time) to become an expert in a field, and given the number of loops seen or mentioned on screen, and how long Phil could spend per day studying, that Phil spent approximately 12,400 days, or nearly 34 years, trapped in the loop.[127] In Rubin's original concept draft, Phil himself estimates that he has been trapped for between 70 and 80 years, having used books to track the passage of time.[3]\n\nBorn to a Jewish family, Ramis had adopted a Buddhist lifestyle from his second wife, embracing some of its precepts.[11][129][130] He said that based on Buddhist doctrine, it takes approximately 10,000 years for a soul to evolve to the next level.[7] In 2005, Rubin said, \"it became this weird political issue because if you asked the studio, 'How long was the repetition?', they'd say, 'Two weeks'. But the point of the movie to me was that you had to feel you were enduring something that was going on for a long time.... For me it had to be—I don't know. A hundred years. A lifetime.\"[131] In his book Groundhog Day, Ryan Gilbey thought the vagueness surrounding the length of the loop was one of the most remarkable elements of the film. Just as there is no justification for why or how Phil is caught in the loop, the length of time is only as long as it takes for Phil to become a better person.[30]\n\n### Thematic analysis\n\nA 9th-century bodhisattva bas-relief. The character of Phil Connors has been interpreted as a bodhisattva: someone who helps others reach nirvana.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film has been interpreted in many ways by different groups.[6][11] Rubin has said that he did not set out to write the film as a spiritual allegory. He simply wanted to tell a story about human life and periods when a person becomes trapped in a cycle that they cannot escape.[132] He said it was not \"just about a man repeating the same day but a story about how to live. Whose life isn't a series of days? Who doesn't feel stuck from time to time?\"[4] In the bowling alley scene, Phil asks two Punxsutawney residents if they understand what it is like to be stuck in a place where nothing they do matters. He is referring to his own situation, but the two men, trapped in their own small-town lives, know exactly what he means.[85]\n\nWhile Rubin and Ramis discussed several of the philosophical and spiritual aspects of the film, they \"never intended [it] to be anything more than a good, heartfelt, entertaining story.\"[4] Murray saw the original script as an interpretation of how people repeat the same day over and over because they are afraid of change.[43] Rubin added that at the start of the loop, it is the worst day of Phil's life. By being forced to change who he is, to embrace the world around him, and each moment of his day, it becomes the best day of his life; the day he falls in love.[5] In a 2017 interview, Murray said he believed Groundhog Day still resonated because it is about \"the idea that we just have to try again... it's such a beautiful, powerful idea.\"[133]\n\nRubin has been contacted throughout the years by different experts providing their own interpretations.[134] It has been seen as a Christian allegory with Punxsutawney Phil representing Jesus Christ,[134] an example of the Nietzschean concept of eternal return, the spirit of Judaism, and the essence of homeopathy.[5][6] It has also been interpreted as an adaptation of the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus who is also condemned to an eternal, daily punishment.[135][136] Others have found significance in the numbers present in the film.[6] Ramis himself was fascinated by Rubin's original draft and its concepts of reincarnation.[137] The date of Groundhog Day also has implications. It is set between the end of winter—characterized in the film as a period of satire and the end of things—and spring—a season represented by comedy and connected with themes of renewal and redemption.[138]\n\nBuddhist leaders commended the representation of the ideologies of regeneration. Phil can be interpreted as a bodhisattva, someone who has reached the brink of Nirvana and returns to Earth to help others to do the same. His loops can represent saṃsāra, a cycle of suffering from which he must escape. In the Jewish faith, Phil's escape or reward can be seen as him being returned to Earth to perform moral deeds or mitzvot—the precepts and commandments of God.[139] In Christianity, his journey can be interpreted as a form of resurrection or a means of securing a place in heaven. In Falun Gong religious philosophy, the film has been interpreted as a message that the spiritual self cannot evolve until it learns from past mistakes.[134][137][139] In Catholicism, Phil's situation can be identified as a form of purgatory, escaped only by embracing selflessness.[130] MacDowell said \"Wouldn't it be great if we had that kind of experience and learn something from it? We go through life and are not always conscious of it... whatever religion you want to base yourself in, that's ultimately why we're here.\"[137] Groundhog Day can also be interpreted as a secular tale in which Phil is experiencing an existential crisis where primal self-indulgence is no longer satisfying, causing him to fall into a depression that he escapes by taking ownership of his own self-improvement; he then uses his improved persona to benevolently help others.[140]\n\nPhil initially compares himself to a god, declaring that as a weatherman, he makes the weather.[137] After several loops, he comes to believe he is a god, asserting that omnipotence may be mistaken for having lived so long one simply knows everything.[130] Using his knowledge he is able to manipulate events in his favor.[129] The repetition gives Phil an opportunity to escape from his own narcissistic self-confinement. Unwilling to change himself, the means to do so are forced upon him.[129] After constant rejection by Rita and his idea of love, Phil hits an emotional low and repeatedly commits suicide. At one point, he suggests that he has killed himself enough times to no longer exist. It is at this point, Ramis suggests, that Phil becomes ready to change.[129][135]\n\nIt is only when Phil stops using the loops to indulge his own desires and instead uses them to selflessly help others that he is freed.[12] In repeatedly failing to save the old homeless man, Phil is also forced to accept that he is not a god.[141] Similarly, regardless of how much knowledge he gains about Rita, and despite his accomplishments learned throughout the loops, he is unable to impress her enough to earn her love. He wins her over only once he stops trying to do so, and instead demonstrates genuine care for others without fakery or self-interest, will likely reset, and it will have all been for naught. Only then does Rita return his affections.[11][12][135] The aspects of Rita that Phil mocked at the start of the film have become qualities he admires and respects, and in turn, Phil receives Rita's love not because he desires it, but because he has genuinely become the type of person that Rita could love.[142] This demonstrates the redeeming power of love, something Ramis wanted to emphasize.[43][135] For him, Groundhog Day represents having the strength and knowledge to make a change when faced with the opportunity to repeat previous mistakes.[129]\n\nRick Brookhiser argues that it is because Phil fully appreciates every facet of the day that he is rewarded by the day being taken from him. He said, \"loving life includes loving the fact that it goes.\"[130] John Seamon said that where other films use memory as a means of reflection or escape, Phil effectively lives within his memories, repeating them indefinitely; he has no hope for a future because everything will reset. By remembering and appreciating new details, Phil is able to grow as a person and becomes the agent of his own change.[143] Rubin said Phil will not return to his old ways after his experiences, but might suffer disappointment that no day will ever live up to his final, perfect February 2, after which he essentially loses his superpowers.[144]\n\n## Legacy\n\nA floor-positioned plaque in Woodstock, Illinois commemorating the pothole Bill Murray's character steps in during Groundhog Day\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroundhog Day is considered one of the most beloved comedy films ever made, an all-time classic, and a pop culture touchstone.[7][145][146] In 2020, Paste described it as having a \"mythic, permanent pop cultural status reserved for few films.\"[80] The film's success made Ramis a credible comedy director, opening up more creative opportunities for him.[147][148] Over the rest of the 1990s, he would direct 1996's Multiplicity (also starring MacDowell), 1999's Analyze This, and 2000's Bedazzled.[11][148] Groundhog Day also showcased Murray's capabilities as an actor, changing perceptions of him as a comedian to a broad-ranged actor and credible romantic lead. His performance is seen as a transitioning point to later roles in serious films like Rushmore (1998), his Academy Award-nominated performance in Lost in Translation, and Moonrise Kingdom (2012).[30] Rubin started a blog in 2007 that featured fictional conversations between himself and Phil Connors, who had since retired to live on a mountainside near Taos, New Mexico. Rubin taught screenwriting at Harvard University for several years.[6]\n\nIts impact on Woodstock and Punxsutawney was lasting and significant. Since the film's release, Woodstock has hosted its own Groundhog Day festivals. These have included groundhog Woodstock Willie,[49] screenings of the film, and walking tours of filming locations.[53] The town attracts approximately 1,000 tourists for its yearly event, which has featured appearances by Albert, Rubin, and Tobolowsky.[7] Punxsutawney, which once drew only a few hundred visitors to its festival, has since attracted tens of thousands. The year following the film's release, over 35,000 people visited the town for Groundhog Day.[4][7] Residents appreciate the film's impact on the town, but assert that their focus remains on Punxsutawney Phil and the long-lived festival.[7] In Woodstock, plaques are positioned at key locations used in the film, commemorating moments including Phil meeting Ned, the pothole in which Phil trips, and the town square pavilion where Phil and Rita share a dance.[49][149]\n\nAs of 2016, Rubin continued to receive mail from fans, philosophers, and religious leaders; their content ranged from simple letters to sermons and dissertations. He has spoken of psychiatrists who recommend the film to their patients, and addicts who have told him that it helped them realize they were trapped in a repeating cycle of their own.[4][6] Some time after the film's release, Murray changed his opinion about it. He called it \"probably the best work I've done,\" adding \"and probably the best work Harold will ever do.\"[30][150] In 2018, Tobolowsky said \"I think [Murray's] performance in Groundhog Day will stand as one of the greatest comedic performances of all time.... He is able to be both antagonist and protagonist at the same time in the same film. He’s everything that’s horrible and everything that’s wonderful.... I think it’s gonna stand up as long as films are made.\"[7] The city of Chicago made a proclamation on February 2, 2024, as \"Harold Ramis Day\", in a ceremony joined by Murray, Ramis' widow Erica Mann Ramis, and other actors from the film.[151]\n\n### Critical reassessment\n\nGroundhog Day is considered one of the greatest films ever made.[67][130][152][153][154] Rotten Tomatoes assesses a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 140 critics, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The consensus reads, \"Smart, sweet, and inventive, Groundhog Day highlights Murray's dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.\"[155] The film has a score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"[156]\n\nIn 2004, The New Yorker called it Ramis's masterpiece.[11] In 2005, as part of his The Great Movies series, Ebert raised his original score for the film from three stars to a full four stars.[5] In this updated review, Ebert said that he had underestimated the film and noted that Murray's performance was essential to making the film work.[6][152] That same year, Jonah Goldberg called it one of the best films of the previous 40 years, positioning it alongside It's a Wonderful Life as one of America's most uplifting and timeless films.[130] In 2009, literary theorist Stanley Fish listed it as one of the ten best American films. He wrote, \"The comedy and the philosophy (how shall one live?) do not sit side by side, but inhabit each other in a unity that is incredibly satisfying.\"[157] It is listed in the 2013 film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which says \"...Bill Murray gives what may be the best and warmest performance of his career in this genius comedy—arguably the best of the 1990s ...\"[158] The Guardian attributes its lasting appeal to its use of a classic redemption arc like Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, and its refusal to explain why the loop occurs, making it less like a typical mainstream film.[30]\n\nIn 2000, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Groundhog Day number 34 on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list recognizing the best comedy films.[159] In 2005, the film's screenplay was listed as the twenty-seventh greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years on the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) 101 Greatest Screenplays list.[160][161] In a 2008 AFI poll of 1,500 industry members, Groundhog Day was ranked as the eighth-best fantasy film.[162][163] That same year Empire listed the film 259th on its list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[153] In 2014, a poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by The Hollywood Reporter ranked it the 63rd-best film of all time.[154] In 2015, the screenplay was listed as the third-funniest on the WGA's 101 Funniest Screenplays list, behind Some Like It Hot (1958) and Annie Hall (1977).[164][165] That same year, it was ranked the 71st-best American film by a BBC Culture poll of international film critics.[166] In 2017, the BBC polled 253 critics (118 female, 135 male) from across 52 countries on the funniest film made. Groundhog Day came fourth, behind Annie Hall, Dr. Strangelove (1964), and Some Like It Hot.[167]\n\nSeveral publications have ranked it as one of the greatest comedy films of all time, including: number one by Empire (2019);[168] number five by Time Out;[169] number 10 by Rotten Tomatoes;[170] number 11 by IGN;[171] number 18 by Paste;[172] number 23 by The Daily Telegraph;[173] and unranked by Film School Rejects and Vogue.[174][175] Rotten Tomatoes also listed the film number 86 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch.[176] Similarly, it has been ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1990s, including: number 4 by IndieWire;[177] number 5 by Slate;[178] number 11 by Rolling Stone;[179] number 12 by ShortList;[180] number 15 by The A.V. Club;[181] number 28 by Rotten Tomatoes;[182] number 41 by Slant Magazine;[183] number 55 by the British Film Institute;[184] and unranked by Time Out.[185]\n\n### Cultural impact\n\nAndie MacDowell with a groundhog on Groundhog Day 2008\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWilliam Goldman in 1993 said \"I think Groundhog Day is the one that will be—of all of the movies that came out this year, it's the one that will be remembered in 10 years.\"[5] The same year, Desson Thomson opined \"Groundhog will never be designated a national film treasure by the Library of Congress.\"[92] In 2006, the film was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[186]\n\nSeveral filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for Groundhog Day or cited it as an inspiration in their own careers, including David O. Russell, Terry Jones,[30] and Jay Roach. Roach called it the film that \"changed him.\"[11] Gillian Wearing called it one of her favorite films, citing its unusual structure and intelligent philosophical message.[30] The film's success helped to legitimize the use of fantasy in mainstream comedy films, laying the groundwork for future fantasy comedies such as Liar Liar (1997), The Truman Show (1998), and Click (2006).[30]\n\nThe phrase \"Groundhog Day\" has become a common term to reference a repetitive, unpleasant, and monotonous situation.[30][187] It is recognized by dictionaries under two definitions: the holiday itself, and \"a situation in which events are or appear to be continually repeated.\"[188][189][190] The term's use is such that it has been defined as a cliché to refer to a situation in this way.[190] It has been invoked (sometimes inaccurately) by singers, sports stars, comedians, actors, politicians,[146][191] archbishops,[150] and former Guantanamo Bay detention camp inmates.[192] Then-President Bill Clinton referenced the film in a 1996 speech to troops stationed in Bosnia.[193] The term was used during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, to refer to the monotony of quarantine and isolation associated with attempts to stem the spread of the virus.[194][195]\n\nThe narrative concept of someone trapped in a repeating segment of time can be traced back to 1904, and is a popular trope, particularly in science-fiction.[6][145] Groundhog Day was responsible for popularizing the idea to the general public.[196][197][198] Time loops have since been used in several films (including Naken (2000), Source Code (2011), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), Happy Death Day (2017) and its sequel, and Palm Springs (2020)),[196][199] television shows (including Russian Doll,[196] Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and The X-Files),[197] and video games (including The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Outer Wilds and Deathloop).[200][201] These narratives often involve a central flawed character who must evolve to escape their chronological imprisonment.[196] The influence of Groundhog Day is such that TV Tropes refers to this narrative arc as the \"Groundhog Day Loop.\"[197] Rubin noted that with his script, he \"stumbled upon a story with all the makings of a classic, so simple and true that it could be retold many different ways by many different storytellers.\"[4] It has been referenced across a range of media, including the 1998 novel About a Boy,[202] the music video for the Craig David song \"7 Days,\" and the Doctor Who audio drama Flip-Flop, that features a time loop on the planet Punxsutawnee.[203] Writing for IGN, Michael Swaim postulated that since Groundhog Day popularized the time loop narrative, it had increased in mainstream popularity in part due to the Flynn effect—a statement on the increasing IQ of the population—that meant audiences could easily follow the more complex narratives, and the desire for nostalgia in the postmodern era of the early 21st century.[204]\n\nOn February 2, 2016, fans in Liverpool, England, gathered to watch the film repeatedly for 24 hours.[205] Since February 2 that year (apart from 2017), Sky Cinema has played the film on repeat for 24 hours.[206][207][208] In 2018, the New York Museum of Modern Art debuted a series of films chosen by polling 35 literary and religious scholars, which started with Groundhog Day. There was conflict between the scholars as so many of them wanted to write about the film for the presentation.[130]\n\n## Adaptations\n\nA sequel was ruled out shortly after the film's release in 1993.[105] Rubin also holds a story credit on the 2004 Italian remake of Groundhog Day, called È già ieri (translated as It's Already Yesterday), and commonly known as Stork Day.[6][40] When asked about a sequel in 2018, MacDowell said it would never happen because \"I know [Murray]. He's not going to do it.\"[209] Despite this, Murray, Tobolowsky, and Doyle-Murray reprised their roles in a commercial for the Jeep Gladiator played during Super Bowl LIV on February 2, 2020. Filmed in Woodstock, the commercial recreates scenes from the film, and features Murray again trapped in a time loop. He uses the Jeep Gladiator to explore Punxsutawney alongside Punxsutawney Phil.[210][211] Murray called it his first and last commercial.[212] In April 2020, Jeep released a series of modified versions of the advert to promote social distancing during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Murray provided creative input on the edit.[194][213]\n\nIn the years since the film's release, Rubin had worked on a musical adaptation of Groundhog Day, partly out of boredom and partly because a musical was not covered by the rights he had signed over to Columbia.[4][6] In 2003, Stephen Sondheim expressed interest creating a musical but this project was never realized.[214] When Matthew Warchus and Tim Minchin approached Rubin in 2012, he had already developed a narrative outline, jokes, and a refined list of 12 songs.[4][6] He had been unable to progress the idea further without a composer. Coming off the success of Matilda the Musical, Warchus and Minchin collaborated with Rubin for several years to produce the Groundhog Day musical.[6] The musical debuted in August 2016, at The Old Vic theatre in London to generally positive reviews.[6][215] A Broadway version started running in 2017.[216] The show was nominated in several categories at the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, winning Best Actor and Best New Musical.[217] Murray attended a Broadway show in 2017, alongside Doyle-Murray and Rubin.[218]\n\nA video game narrative sequel was released in September 2019. Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son was developed by Tequila Works and published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality for PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive. The game casts players as Phil's son, Phil Connors Jr., who has grown up in the shadow of his beloved father. Phil Jr. becomes trapped in his own time loop in Punxsutawney and is forced to help others and improve himself to earn his freedom.[219][220][221] It received mixed critical reviews.[222]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b Archerd, Army (June 1, 1992). \"Wagner thinks 'Pink'\".

The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(Män som hatar kvinnor) was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is difficult to say because they actually play the character quite different. Noomi is older and seems more secure and determined character while Mara feels more fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is described in the book. I like this movie better but regarding Lisbeth Salander it's a draw. Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist, and it's good that even if he is a big star(James Bond) he plays the role really down to earth, the person the character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his predecessor is Stellan Skarsgård. Considering his character has such a big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher Plummer should also be mentioned. As I'm now on the actors I should also mention the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time later in the movie I didn't mind anymore. \n\nSteven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie, even though it was not much shorter the plot at times felt rushed. Especially the ending where it went so quick and simplified. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn't read the book you can follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this movie above the Swedish. So there are some changes but for me, unlike how some feel about adaptations, the book isn't something holy and changes don't have to be wrong. Stieg Larsson's novel was not without flaws and the changes they made make sense, necessary and some better. Fincher is a master of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone. \n\nThe music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing. Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it's a bit out of place but personally I loved it. \n\nSo are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson's novel was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy, the story is not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn't mess with your head like Se7en. \n\nIf I'm to rank David Fincher's detective thrillers The girl with the dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn't mean it is a weak movie, definitely not! I don't think I can find much they could have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better. It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book. Also works great as a thriller on it's own.\n\n- Jona1988\n- Dec 21, 2011\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ14\n\n- What is the real title of the novel and what does it mean?\n- What is 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' about?\n- Is 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' based on a book?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - January 12, 2012 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - Sweden\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official Twitter\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Swedish\n- Also known as\n    - La chica del dragón tatuado\n- Filming locations\n    - Hofsta Manor, Björkvik, Södermanlands län, Sweden(Vanger's estate)\n- Production companies\n    - Columbia Pictures\n    - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n    - Scott Rudin Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $90,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $102,515,793\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $12,768,604\n    - Dec 25, 2011\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $232,617,430\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 38 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - Datasat\n    - SDDS\n    - Dolby Surround 7.1\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was realised in 2010 in America and stars Leonardo DiCaprio. When researching this film we saw that shutter island was the most ideal film for us to help us film key conventions of psychological thrillers. Our film opening is a paranoid fiction, so to get an brief idea to what techniques we needed to implement, Shutter island used all the codes and conventions needed for psychological  thrillers. When watching Shutter Island we focused on mise-en-scene and sound. When focusing on mise-en-scene we looked closely as costume, setting and lighting, in Shutter Island the costume most males wear are formal suits and women are dressed in formal business wear.  Even though this is a paranoid fiction it still highlights the fact everything is ordinary, but some aspects are out of place. In other words everything is set out in an ordinary environment; characters are behaving ‘normally’ doing stereotypical job roles. However there is always that one character or certain aspect that doesn’t fit in with the ordinary society. Likewise we have kept this element as keeping the environment and costume ordinary, but through editing and cinematography the characters may seem out of place. For instance in our film opening, because Karolina is paranoid the audience can sense this. Other characters may be unaware of her thoughts, so this would be an out of place element, as her mind-set is unanticipated. Although since we have concentrated on costume, Karolina costume will be appropriate for the society she is in.  \n\nMoving on watching the first ten minutes of Shutter Island, the low levels of light implies that the this genre may be based on thriller. The shot looks eerie as dark lights which suggest something could be out of place. This adds to the main codes and conventions needed to spook the audience through lighting. Followed by setting, this will impact the audience fear levels if everything is located in an ordinary environment it may loose its fear factor. But seeing as this is a sub-genre of thriller, mystery and drama it is less likely to be situated in dark gloomy locations that follow the rule of horrors. Shutter Island is a thriller based film so this means that there is likely to be crime and upsetting scenes, usually more realistic than horrors. We will embrace the rules of thriller by making sure that the film opening is set in a natural environment. One significant scene I like is where the camera zooms into the action where the gates open, this makes the audience feel like their being lured into an terrifying atmosphere. If we implement this camera zooming effect into our film opening, this will make the audience get a view of what the protagonist is seeing making viewers more sympathetic for the main character. Overall we have analysed Shutter Island and highlighted the key media techniques they use in all sections (sound, editing, mise-en-scene and cinematography). They use artistic shots and mainly close-up to show emotions and facial expressions because these may indicate whether someone is acting ordinary or out of place.  We  found this film quite interesting and intriguing, through sound they engage the viewers to want to watch more, this creates suspense and fear into the audience, which creates the ‘thriller’ atmosphere. Shutter Island is defiantly the film we want to base our opening on as it shows the essential codes and conventions of a thriller very clearly.\n\n## Session 9\n\nSession 9 is a 2001 American independent film directed by Brad Anderson. The film is an psychological horror consisting of many sub-genre, such as psychological thriller mystery and horror. The film is based on hospital with a horrific past that seems to be coming back staring David Caruso as the main character. Because this film is a horror we had to reduce the fear factor because our opening is based on paranoid fictions. However paranoid fictions consist of many sub-genres, so when researching paranoia films we saw many were either thriller or horror base because it needed to keep the element of psychological disorders. I've noticed when watching this film the main aspect that kept cropping us was the mise-en-scene and in this the directors of Session 9, wanted to emphasis lighting and props. In the advertisement the chair is symbolic as it signifies the mental incapability's the character has. In our film opening we have incorporated the rope as the main prop as this will be highlighted in the artistic shots. Props are important because they could direct the audience to an action. I think it is vital to embed this idea because our the rope has many connotations linked with our story. However this film is interesting because it utilises key conventions needed to make an psychological horror effective. Horror and thrillers and similar in a way, but thrillers are more realistic and less fearful than horrors. Session 9 isn't our focal point but we have used similar features to make our film opening presentable. \n\nHowever in the first few minutes of Session 9 I can see that there are low levels of dark yellow and brown lighting. Brown is a more revealing colour this may show that something unknown may be unravelled. Although this contrast from the genre, brown is simply the colour for comfort and security, so in this case making the linkage between the chair as the prop, this may be important to one of the characters. Having an symbolic prop may provide security for the person, the dark yellow and brown colours support this reason of simplicity. Moving on from mise-en-scene, a lot of psychological horrors are set in hospital, from this the audience can make assumptions on the fear factor. This differs from thrillers because most thrillers age certificate are rated 15, our film opening will be rated 15 as there it is less frightening. Session 9 age certificate is 18, this shows that it is horrifying for younger audiences to view, so we cannot adopt some features into our opening because it will be too inappropriate. After watching this film I've noticed if you pay attention you can figure out the plot before  getting into the movie, this is mainly due to everything we see (mise-en-scene). There are many scenes I like in this film, the directors uses many long shot with long durations and close-up with fast edits to create tension and fear in the future. I think through editing we can create illusions and different effects to surprise the audience. We have implemented the fast edits into our film opening, this is when Karolina is walking through the train station, she think's she sees Joshua to only realise it's an female by passer. This is one of the best shots we have used as we incorporated this technique from Session 9.\n\n## Obsessed\n\nObsessed is a 2009 American mainstream thriller film directed by Steve Shill. This film is  a sub-genre of moderate thriller and drama, starring major Hollywood stars such as Idris Alba and Beyoncé Knowles. The story line still links to the psychological impairment we have incorporated into our opening. Instead of paranoia this film focuses on obsessive disorders. This film has elements of psychological disorders and paranoia such as Erotomania the character suffers a delusion disorder where she has been excessively obsessed with a person believing that he loves her. Likewise our film opening is based on paranoia, Karolina believing she is seeing her dead boyfriend, when it is all in her head. I researched obsessed because this film is more moderate and suitable for teenagers, the age certificate to watch this film is 12A, but it still contains some horrific scenes. One gory scene is where the female is pushed down the stairs and hits her head on the table covered in blood. Our film opening will not contain any bloody scenes. However one aspect I liked about this film is that when the female is falling down, there was a low angle shot. This suggests the female antagonist is at a lower position because she is falling to her death, soon she will have no status because she is dead, that is why the camera rotate around her body because it shows uncertainty as there are no camera levels to show her status. However we could implement this shot by rotating the camera around Karolina as one of the artistic shots. But we have used the camera panning technique in the beginning where the camera moves across Karolina's desk.\n\n## Black Swan\n\nBlack Swan is a 2010 American psychological thriller film directed by Darren Aronofsky, starring Natalie \nPortman, which consist of other genres such as Horror and drama. The reason I have researched this film is because it seems captivating and intriguing, which links with the paranoid fiction element we want to portray. In the film poster the pale white face of the ballerina has connotations of thing of ambiguity and obscurity, this cold is the image of death as the red piercing eyes could imply the darkness the character represents. But on the other hand the white colour could represent her innocence as her facial expression appears to be firm. In our film opening white is a significant colour because is symbolises ghostly spiritual rituals in this case we used white because Joshua is dead represent the ghostly figure. At this point he is nonrepresentational because his character is made up in Karolina’s head, adding to the element of the paranoid fiction. Personally what attracts in Black Swan is that the director has looked deeply into the mental state of the obsessive compulsive character creating a psychological thriller based on discrete psychological disorders. We looked closely a black swan because they use a variety of artistic shots because of the genre and nature of the film being artsy.\n\nPowered by\n\n<!-- image -->",

Several events which take place in the hours before the characters' arrival are introduced at key moments in the film using reverse chronology structure and, in a parallel story, a murderer awaits a verdict at a crucial trial that will determine whether he will be executed for his crimes.\n\n## Plot\n\nA convict named Malcolm Rivers awaits execution for a vicious mass murder that took place at an apartment building. Journals belonging to Malcolm are discovered misfiled in the case evidence; they were not introduced during the trial. Malcolm's psychiatrist, Dr. Malick, and his defense attorney argue the journals prove Malcolm's insanity.\n\nMeanwhile, ten strangers find themselves stranded in a torrential rainstorm at a remote Nevada motel, run by Larry Washington. The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, a washed-up, irritable actress; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a sex worker; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice (who was severely injured when Ed accidentally hit her with his limo), and their nine-year-old son, Timmy.\n\nWith the group all in separate rooms, Suzanne is killed by an unknown assailant. Ed discovers Suzanne's head in a dryer, along with the number 10 motel key. Maine is suspected to be the killer as he has escaped. Ginny locks herself in the bathroom to escape Lou during a fight, only for the unknown assailant to murder Lou out of Ginny's sight.\n\nAt the hearing, Malcolm's diaries indicate that Malcolm suffers from dissociative identity disorder, harboring eleven distinct personalities. His defense attorney argues that he is unaware of his crimes, which is in violation of existing Supreme Court rulings on capital punishment. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder as Malcolm is brought in.\n\nWhile taking photos of Lou's crime scene, Ed finds the number 9 key in Lou's hands. He begins to suspect that the killer is counting down and targeting them in order. Maine fails to escape the motel area, and he is subdued by Rhodes and Ed. Larry is instructed to guard Maine, but suspicion falls on him when Maine is found dead. Rhodes and Ed find the number 8 key next to his body, and they harass Larry, who takes Paris hostage. Paris wrestles him off, causing Larry to attempt to escape in his truck, but he accidentally crushes George against a dumpster as he tries to save Timmy from being run over.\n\nRhodes ties Larry to a chair and orders the other guests to stay until dawn. Larry convinces Paris and Ed that he is not the perpetrator by telling them how he ended up at the motel. Alice, still in bed, is checked on and presumably has died from her injuries, but Rhodes finds the number 6 key. George's body is recovered and the number 7 key is found in his pocket, which confuses the others.\n\nEd tells Ginny and Timmy to flee in a car, but it explodes upon their arrival. The last four survivors discover that the bodies of all the previous victims have disappeared. Paris has a mental breakdown, revealing her birthday is on May 10; it transpires that all eleven people were born on May 10 — which is also Malcolm's birthday and the day he committed the murders.\n\nEd checks their ID cards in the office, discovering that each one of them is named after a state, and that their birthdays all match. With Dr. Malick calling out to him, Ed finds he is at the hearing, but is confused as to why he is there. Dr. Malick explains that he is one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child. Learning one of the personalities committed the murders, Ed is instructed to \"go back\" to the motel to try to eliminate them.\n\nAs Ed returns to the motel, Paris finds convict-transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car, revealing Rhodes is a criminal acting as an officer. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is shot to death by Rhodes. Finally believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him and the two men end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive.\n\nWith the homicidal personality removed, Malcolm's execution is stayed and he is ordered to be placed in a mental institution under Dr. Malick's care. In Malcolm's mind, Paris settles down in her hometown of Frostproof, Florida. As she tends to her orange grove, she discovers the number 1 key buried in the dirt, and she finds Timmy behind her. It is revealed Timmy is actually the murderous personality and that he orchestrated all of the deaths at the motel, including faking his own death. Timmy kills Paris and takes over completely, causing Malcolm to strangle Malick and forcing the van that is en route to the mental institution to swerve off the road and stop before Timmy's voice repeats the poem \"Antigonish\" by William Hughes Mearns one more time.\n\n## Cast\n\n- John Cusack as Edward “Ed” Dakota, a limousine driver and a former Los Angeles police officer\n- Ray Liotta as Samuel Rhodes, a correctional officer transporting a convicted murderer Maine\n- Amanda Peet as Paris Nevada, a sex worker leaving Las Vegas to buy a citrus grove in Florida\n- John Hawkes as Larry Washington, the motel manager\n- Alfred Molina as Dr. Mallick, Rivers' psychiatrist\n- Clea DuVall as Ginny Isiana, a superstitious newlywed\n- John C.

Besser as Frozen Body Larry\n\n## Production\n\nDirector James Mangold stated in an interview prior to the film's release that he was attracted to a claustrophobic thriller because \"I don't see this as a genre that's tapped out at this point. You can make it sound dead end but these remain some of the most cinematic films ever made, whether you're talking about Rear Window, The Others, Polanski's Knife in the Water, Dead Calm, Carpenter's The Thing, Alien, huge piles of great films that buck conventional wisdom that a movie should be cinematically broad like a Lawrence of Arabia.\"[2]\n\nActor John Cusack was pursued for the lead because Mangold and producer Cathy Konrad both felt like he was perfect for the role. As Mangold said in another interview, “When you think of movies like The Grifters, you don't feel like it's such a stretch. I'd met John a few times and there's this great 'Everyman' sense to him. And while there's this great warmth to him, especially as he's grown older, there's also a simplicity, a gravity to him. There's something very solid about John.\"[3]\n\nUpon being offered the role and sent the script, Cusack stated \"I started reading and I thought 'alright well, we'll see how this thing goes', then on page 30 I thought I had it pegged and I didn't. And then on page 50 I thought I had figured it out, but I didn't … and then I kept going this way, and then by the end of it I really hadn't seen any of those things coming. So I thought 'man, that's pretty seamless' because you know I should have figured this out.\"[4] During an appearance on CBS's The Early Show, Cusack summarized his thoughts by saying \"It was one of the most clever scripts I've read in a long time.\"[5]\n\n90 percent of the film was shot on Stage 27 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. Stage 27 is the same sound stage that once housed the Emerald City during production of The Wizard of Oz. Mangold used production designer Mark Friedberg to transform the sound stage into a complex set with endless rain, featuring a motel with a swimming pool, 14 rooms, and surrounding desert.[2] Filming also took place on location at the Four Aces Movie Ranch in Palmdale, which features the motel from which the motel built on Stage 27 was modeled, Los Angeles City Hall in Los Angeles, and other exterior locations in Palmdale and Lancaster, California.[6][7]\n\nAngelo Badalamenti was originally signed to score the film, but his music was replaced with a new score by Alan Silvestri.[8]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office performance\n\nIdentity opened on April 25, 2003 in the United States and Canada in 2,733 theaters.[1] The film ranked at #1 on its opening weekend, accumulating $16,225,263, with a per theater average of $5,936.[9] The film's five-day gross was $18,677,884.[10]\n\nThe film dropped down to #3 on its second weekend, behind newly released X2 and The Lizzie McGuire Movie, accumulating $9,423,662 in a 41.9% drop from its first weekend, and per theater average of $3,448.[11] By its third weekend, it dropped down to #4 and made $6,477,585, $2,474 per theater average.[12]\n\nIdentity went on to gross $52.1 million in the United States and Canada and $38.1 million overseas. In total, the film has grossed over $90 million worldwide, making it a box office success against its $28 million budget.[1]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site's consensus states: \"Identity is a film that will divide audiences—the twists of its plot will either impress or exasperate you.\"[13] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[14] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[15]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, \"I've seen a lot of movies that are intriguing for the first two acts and then go on autopilot with a formula ending. Identity is a rarity, a movie that seems to be on autopilot for the first two acts and then reveals that it was not, with a third act that causes us to rethink everything that has gone before. Ingenious, how simple and yet how devious the solution is.\"[16]\n\nMick LaSalle of SFGate reported, \"At first, Identity seems like nothing more than a pleasing and blatant homage (i.e., rip-off) to the Agatha Christie-style thriller where marooned guests realize that a murderer is in their midst... we've seen it before. Yet make no mistake. Identity is more than an entertaining thriller. It's a highly original one.\"[17]\n\nThe Village Voice's Dennis Lim wrote of the film's premise, \"The premise of the one-rainy-night thriller Identity seems like mothballed Agatha Christie,\" and of the film's third act twist, \"The ultimate cliché of plot-twist implausibility, the crucial revelation is so outlandishly fatuous it might have given Donald Kaufman pause. But there's nothing self-parodic about Identity—the viewer must not only swallow the nullifying third-act bombshell but actually re-engage with the movie on its new, extremely dubious terms.\"[18]\n\nBrian Mckay of eFilmCritic.com wrote, \"This film's cardinal sin was not that it had an engrossing but extremely far-fetched setup to a lackluster resolution—a resolution that probably sounded good during the initial script pitch, but which nobody realized was going to be such a misfire until the production was already at the point of no return. No, what Identity is guilty of most is bad timing—it simply gives away too much, too soon. At about the halfway mark (if not much sooner), the film's big \"twist\" will finally dawn on you (and if it doesn't, they'll end up coming right out and saying it five minutes later anyway). And once it does, you will no longer care what happens afterward.\"[19]\n\n### Director's response and rumored connection to the film Adaptation (2002)\n\nSince its release, the film gained a small following. In 2017, Mangold said he's very \"proud\" of the movie:\n\n\"I love Identity, I love it. In fact, I think some of the filmmaking, the craftsmanship, the image making, is such that I'm very proud of it. Interestingly, when Adaptation (2002) came out, and there's a joke in the movie about someone with split personality, that came out right before Identity. You know the joke? Nic Cage is working on this crazy idea for a movie, the idea that the killer has multiple personalities, and Adaptation came out about three months before Identity. When I saw Adaptation, I realized I was dead. Half the reviews of Identity were going, like, this is the movie about the stupid joke, someone made a movie of the joke in Adaptation. And it was crushing, honestly, it was crushing because I spent a year and a half working on the movie, and it was kind of like half of the reviews were calling it silly. But part of what I loved about Identity, and maybe you too, was that it was so crazy, that it was just a completely crazy movie. And the freedom of the concept meant that you could exist in a more dreamy, fever-dream space with the film, which was very freeing to me, to be this kind of noir And Then There Were None amped up to eleven on the volume knob. It was very exciting for me, and hugely enjoyable, and I'm very proud of the movie.\"[20]\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film and Best DVD Special Edition Release at 30th Saturn Awards, but lost to Kill Bill Volume 1 and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, respectively.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d \"Identity (2003)\".

Populated by several of Hollywood’s most promising stars from the early part of the decade—including Kevin Bacon, fresh from Tremors; Julia Roberts, her celebrity just solidified by Pretty Woman; and Kiefer Sutherland, with two Young Guns titles behind him—the film’s over-produced stylistic approach remains effective, if distracting. By 1990, Schumacher had demonstrated his deft hand at ensembles and accessible horror films, having St. Elmo’s Fire (1985) and The Lost Boys (1987) to his credit. He would remain one of the most sought-after directors for much of the 1990s, helming successful John Grisham adaptations and profitable, yet utterly dull, entries in the Batman franchise. And while a string of failures in the 2000s left Schumacher to release schlocky garbage like The Number 23 (2007) and Trespass (2011), it should not be forgotten that his work once stood at the forefront of the 1990s pop-culture zeitgeist.\n\nWith that said, Flatliners has never been a very good film. Its popularity subsists on star-power and surface sheen—of which there are copious amounts. The script by Peter Filardi attempts to wax philosophical about religious and philosophic views on death, following a group of self-serious medical students who seek to explore the boundaries of the afterlife, while also testing their own overconfident abilities as would-be doctors. Using drugs to induce death, the students cause their own flatlines on a heart monitor. After a minute or so (a timeframe that increases with each person to try the experiment), the others resuscitate the willing participant, much to the audience’s anticipation. Will they be able to revive the subject? After one or two participants come back without much effort, the suspense hardly seems worth getting excited about. Fortunately, Filardi interrupts the otherwise heavy material with humor provided by go-to comic relief actor Oliver Platt, playing Steckle, a realist character who dictates his inner monologue on a recorder. His unwillingness to participate makes him the only character who realizes the absurdity of the film’s setup: “Halloween. A full moon. Aren’t we going a bit too far?” Of course, each of them learns that exploring death has its consequences, as they’re haunted by past traumas and unconscious guilt until they resolve their karmic crimes.\n\nSutherland plays Nelson, the resident bad boy who conceives the idea and insists on being the first to go. When Nelson returns, he talks about his eyes being opened to the world around him—a notion that convinces the others to try their luck at death. But whatever the temporary benefits are (they’re never elaborated upon), they’re quickly replaced by waking dreams of unresolved psychological hangups. Nelson is visited by a boy he bullied as a child, and his hallucination resolves to beat the living daylights out of him. Another hotshot med student, David (Bacon), bullied a young black girl as a child, and after he returns from beyond, she appears to David to deliver endless streams of playground insults. (Just to keep track, that’s not one but two former bullies out of four med students.) Rachel (Julia Roberts), a character whose beauty the other characters remark about constantly, still blames herself for her Vietnam vet father’s drug addiction and suicide after his return from the war. And then there’s the resident sex, lies and videotape character played by William Baldwin, whose lousy views toward women (despite being engaged to Hope Davis) leave him haunted by his promiscuity—a plot point undoubtedly informed by Rob Lowe’s sex tape scandal in the late 1980s.\n\nAs suggested, Flatliners has one of the busiest visual presentations audiences are likely to find in any 1990s-era thriller. Cinematographer Jan De Bont and production designer Eugenio Zanetti realize the film’s world as a post-apocalyptic med school. Shot around the University of Chicago and the Museum of Science and Industry, the film’s unsubtle atmosphere drenches every scene, no matter how inconsequential. The Holloween setting finds slow-motion passages of costumed extras dancing about and autumnal decorations littering the backdrop. Steam emanates from every manhole, while smoke from burning piles of leaves fills the air. Random sheets of plastic hang from scaffolding, as though every building in the film were undergoing renovations. Reflective shadows have been projected onto walls like light bouncing off water, suggesting there’s a pool in every room, or even outside, except there isn’t. And don’t forget the neon graffiti faces painted onto brick walls in alleyways, foreshadowing Schumacher’s use of them in his cartoonish Batman films.\n\nOne or two of these touches could create an effectively creepy mood, but all of them together begin to generate unintentional questions about the characters and their settings. For instance, the makeshift lab where the group holds their secret experiments: Couldn’t they have found a workspace without a leaky roof that causes a power outage at an inopportune time? Or at least a room with better lighting? Instead, De Bont saturates the frame with a pumpkin-orange hue, contrasted by neon blue lights that imply an antiseptic quality. But these stylistic choices apply not only to the baroque room where the characters play god, but also their daytime classroom settings, which, due to shadowy lighting, look as though their instructors are attempting to recreate the conditions of medieval autopsies. Moreover, each of the group’s hallucinations have been shot in a unique style: Sutherland’s are lit with varying blue light bulbs, Roberts’s are accompanied by red neon, Bacon’s dreams contain frenzied cutting, and Baldwin’s black-and-white video recordings appear projected onto televisions and walls—and all of them are intercut with flashbacks.\n\nHarp as I have about the visual choices in Flatliners, its stylistic glut and attractive cast were enough (at the time of its release) to divert from the rather silly outcome of the plot. Today, it seems entirely too convenient that everyone survives their ordeal. In essence, the penalties for toying with death involve shedding one’s baggage, followed by a sense of lasting relief. The only negative consequence for any of these characters is Baldwin breaking up with his fiancée (though one suspects he’ll become a better person in the long run). Everone else becomes a happier, more well-adjusted person for their experiences. The lesson here: You, too, can free yourself of lingering psychological issues by orchestrating your own temporary afterlife experience. Though the film would go on to become a major theatrical hit, earning nearly three-times its $26 million budget, followed by a successful life on VHS and cable, Flatliners has not aged well. Aside from Bacon and Platt, the acting is either overblown (Sutherland) or inconsistent (Roberts, and her wavering southern accent). And a slew of subsequent films (watch Defending Your Life or Hereafter) have dealt with near-death experiences with far more supernatural and emotional consequence, leaving Flatliners, however exceedingly polished, to feel hollow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consider Supporting Deep Focus Review\n\nI hope you’re enjoying the independent film criticism on Deep Focus Review.

The film follows a group of self-serious medical students who seek to explore the boundaries of the afterlife, while also testing their own overconfident abilities as would-be doctors.

The film spends much of its time inside the Narrator’s mind, as we see his surrounding world from his perspective, and using a secondary character, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a fabrication of his imagination, as a way of exploring his hidden inner emotions.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Interiors, Alex McDowell, production designer of Fight Club, discusses his feature film collaboration with David Fincher. “I started working with David Fincher when he was directing for Propaganda, doing many music videos – Madonna's ‘Oh Father,’ Aerosmith’s ‘Janie’s Got a Gun’ and Don Henley’s award-winning ‘The End of the Innocence.’ I also worked on his earliest commercials. This was a solid year of seven-day weeks with David at the start of being the most sought-after director in the business, where we were overlapping projects, and I was running two or three art crews in rotation.” This was at the start of Alex McDowell’s career, as he notes, “I’d not built any large sets, but David always had an expectation of cinematic scale, and I learnt a lot very fast trying to work to his expectations!” Their extensive collaboration in music videos and commercials carried over into the feature film world. Alex McDowell notes that by the time Fight Club came around, shorthand existed between them.\n\nIn regards to their work together, he also points out that David Fincher is “a filmmaker who could if he wished do better work than all of his keys in their respective fields – he’s a good artist and can visualize and sketch exactly what he is imagining.” In addition, his collaboration with the process is individualized. David Fincher “compartmentalizes his direction for each part of the process – so when he was speaking with me, he’d be addressing only the specific information that I would need at that moment as production designer.” This information would include details about the overall context – lighting, blocking – but would be focused on the design elements. “I like working with this degree of specificity because it really allows me to put all my attention to the core design, with minimum extraneous noise, and very little energy wasted in multiple alternates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFight Club is a film that establishes a world – one that exists primarily in the mind of its characters – therefore locations have a significant role in the film. “The tone and scope of the film come from the real world constraints, but David Fincher had great influence on the selection of locations.” In the course of the film, David Fincher searched for a delicate balance within the locations – “a nameless unidentifiable city (several cities really) extracted from Los Angeles.” In this sense, we have an understanding of how several cities are pieced together as a collage in an effort to create one specific look. Alex McDowell also notes that on location, David Fincher would always have a clear idea of how he would film a scene – “the blocking of the actors, the direction and quality of light, exactly where to lay the track, what lens he would use – even months before the actual shoot day.”\n\nIn our analysis, we focused on a scene in which both the Narrator and Tyler battle each other. The Narrator, after losing his belongings in a fire, unsuccessfully calls Tyler from a payphone. There is no answer and he hangs up; when a call comes in, David Fincher’s camera pushes onto the phone. The barely legible sign reads, “No Incoming Calls Allowed.” If an incoming call is impossible, this highlights the fact that Tyler doesn’t exist in this world.\n\nThe following image is of a wide shot of Lou’s Tavern, a location that is prominently used over the course of the film. The characters exchange dialogue before exiting from the rear of the bar. They walk outside the back doors and are positioned in the center of the frame. Edward Norton stands on the right with a dumpster further to the right of the frame. Brad Pitt stands on the left with piled up garbage bags to the left side of the frame. There are doors directly behind them, which separate them within the frame, further establishing a sense that both characters are mirror images of one another. It’s interesting to note that the first thing we see Tyler do here is check the payphone for quarters; in the previous scene, the Narrator had placed a quarter in a payphone (a shot that David Fincher shows us with an extreme close-up) and called Tyler.\n\nTyler demands that the Narrator punch him; after debating his intentions, we freeze onto an image of Tyler, as we receive some initial background information on him, seeing him in his workplace, splicing individual frames into feature films and serving food as a waiter. In these moments, David Fincher takes us out of the action for side notes within the narrative.\n\nTyler edges him on and remarks, “How much can you know about yourself if you’ve never been in a fight?” This becomes a clear example of the Narrator speaking with himself, having inner conflicts. The camera then focuses on two empty beer bottles that Tyler places on the ground beside him. In the distance, on top of a payphone, we clearly see a single beer bottle. Tyler, of course, exists only within the Narrator’s mind; by focusing on the beer bottles, we’re constantly questioning the notion of doubles.\n\nThe duo then breaks into an altercation. The camera, which had been previously centered on the characters, slightly moves and follows their movements while maintaining a balance in terms of hierarchy. The level of detail in this scene is also noteworthy – after cutting onto the two wide shots of the characters fighting, both bottles are still in position, despite the change in camera setups.\n\nThe diagram indicates the actual fight between both characters. The numbers focus on various moments during their altercation – (1) Tyler asks the Narrator to punch him, (2) the Narrator hits him and (3) Tyler hits back. This indicates the escalation of their altercation, as the movement lines track the characters from leaving the bar to the end of the scene. In addition, the Narrator is presented in black whereas Tyler is in an outline.\n\nThe location of this key scene is noteworthy because Lou’s Tavern is where these characters interact in depth for the first time. It’s also here where we learn about the differences between both characters. The Narrator’s life revolves around his materialistic possessions, whereas Tyler is more carefree. This scene between both characters is also referenced over the course of the film. In a later scene, when both characters enter Lou’s Tavern for their first fight club meeting, the gentleman standing by the door nods only to the Narrator, once again emphasizing that Tyler doesn’t exist. In addition, when the Narrator punches himself in his boss’s office, we freeze on him, as he notes that he is reminded of his first fight with Tyler. This alludes to the fact that he was fighting with himself then, as he is now. In the course of the film, after the reveal has been made, a flashback takes us back to the scene at the bar. In a new angle, we now see the altercation; from their perspective, we see the Narrator fighting with himself. This provides us with an objective look at the same scene. David Fincher switches from a subjective perspective onto an objective perspective after the reveal has been made.\n\nLou’s Tavern is also significant because it’s where the rules of fight club are established; the basement that was used for production, however, was constructed in 20th Century Fox Studios. Shipwreck Joey’s, a former topless bar, which had closed in July 1990, served as the location for Lou’s Tavern. The bar was located at the northeast corner of Figueroa Street and Harry Bridges Boulevard in Wilmington, California. The location had been an abandoned auto repair shop that had been covered from the bar. The establishment, which was displayed prominently in the area, was demolished soon after filming.\n\nThe production searched in and around San Pedro in search of a “compelling interior/exterior location that would be desolate, working class, with great looking exterior views based on an anonymous look and context - adjacent freeway, desolate industrial landscape and docks, no residential character - and a good interior layout.”\n\nAlex McDowell notes that, in that sense, the location was a “remarkable combination of industrial layers and faded glamour.” In addition, the production picked up on some of the evidence of color from its strip club days, which added to the overall texture. In this sense, much of their work was “stripping away the clutter and revealing the bones.” Alex McDowell notes, “I remember trying largely to leave it alone and let it work for us. The textures and layers of history that a natural location can deliver are often more compelling than anything we might add, so that location was a balance and tension between the existing value and David Fincher and film’s needs.”\n\nIn discussing this scene, Alex McDowell, notes that the production “replaced a roll-up door at the front of the building with the two black doors centered in a set wall. David Fincher was very clear on his shots, and our energies were focused on ensuring that his blocking of the actors was supported by the set elements that we brought to the location. David would have expectation that anything needed was achievable, and we would go to whatever lengths necessary to adapt locations and build sets to his specific needs so that the machinery of the shooting would deliver the images in his head.”\n\nIn terms of architecture, Fight Club balances the late Twentieth Century banal and the historic. David Fincher searched for an Art Deco historical aesthetic, which Alex McDowell balanced with a more Victorian industrial Detroit influence. In speaking of the visual look of the film, Alex McDowell notes, the film is a “nuanced exploration into the subtle degrees of colorless, vapid corporate architecture that nevertheless provided an aesthetic beautifully lit contrast to the texture of the Paper Street house, Lou’s Tavern and the richness of Tyler’s world.”\n\nAlex McDowell notes that this influence, as well as the Paper Street House, “derived as a combination of my research and scouting in Detroit (individual houses left standing on city blocks after Devil’s Night culling) and my late-seventies experience in London as an art student when I lived in a conjoined squat with holes cut in the dividing walls between buildings so that occupants could escape police raids on one building by slipping into the next, and a shared back yard that very much resembled the Paper Street house exterior.” In the design of their “nameless city,” the production team researched such locations in an effort to create their own world.\n\nIn addition, after the production dived into the banality of Los Angeles, the crew spring boarded off that to corporate architecture for residential housing. Alex McDowell points out that a key phrase in their minds for the look of the Narrator’s life was “file-cabinets for young professional – placing the Narrator in a soulless box that gave him nothing back.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe locations were a reflection of the characteristics of each individual. The exterior of the Narrator’s apartment, a bland example of corporate housing, was found in Downtown Los Angeles and the interior space was then constructed based on that appearance. Alex McDowell notes that “the IKEA element was a crucial metaphor for this catalogue mediated life, and it was also designed to resemble a catalogue interior, and dressed accordingly – nothing in it that wasn’t devoid of personality or identity.”\n\nAlex McDowell notes that, “as a (British) alien to Los Angeles, I’ve always found the city fascinating and eternally appealing, and a large part of that lies in its remove from any European architectural tradition, its human economic driven organic growth, and the intricate layers of subtly different but repetitive forms, and typologies. Fight Club was the perfect expression of that, an amazing opportunity to explore banality and vacuity as a legitimate artistic exercise. It’s the film that got me inside the fabric of a city, in a richer way than any since, while allowing me to develop an eye for threading a fictional design narrative across and through real space.”\n\nThe collaboration with David Fincher proved invaluable, as he notes that he remains “the most stimulating collaborator whose demands pushed our work in a way that drove many of our careers from that time on.” Fight Club, for him, is a special project, which resulted in an unforgettable experience. “It also remains one of my favorite film regardless of having designed it.”\n\nInterview with Alex McDowell\n\nAlex McDowell is the founder and creative director of 5D | Global Studio, an interdisciplinary, multi-platform, and cross-media design studio.

            "content": "Sign up\n\nSign in\n\nWrite\n\nSign up\n\nSign in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n# The Others (2001) Emotional Design Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKeiran Sparksman\n\nFollow\n\n--\n\nListen\n\nShare\n\nThe Others (Amenábar, 2001) is a period ghost story set in post-WWII Jersey, a British dependency off the coast of Normandy, France.\n\nIt borrows extensive storytelling techniques from the period (particularly late German Expressionism) and, as the writer/director initially didn’t speak English until he was producing the movie, the focus of the film is less on the dialogue, and more on visual metaphor, emotional and evocative acting, and stylized embodiment in both sets and effect. It plays heavily with notions of traditional gender and family and the roles in which women played in critical periods in history.\n\nAt one stage of production, the lead actress (Nicole Kidman) quit from the combined emotional toll of the movie’s production and her marriage breakdown with the Lead Producer, her former husband Tom Cruise. These combined aspects express themselves in an emotional piece of storytelling of gender, family, potential insanity, ghosts, perseverance and, finally, enlightenment.\n\n# Which Emotions does the Film seek to Invoke?\n\nBeing a ghost story, The Others would generally seek to design characters suitable for experiencing emotional Horror, but this film there is also an overwhelming sense of Sadness and Grief, which almost overrides the Fear commonly associated with the genre. One method we can use to understand the emotional intent of a film is through Stephen Follow’s (2017) method of facial expression analysis. If we use this on the posters used to market this movie, we can also see the film tilting between the thriller and horror genres, and so can understand the storyteller’s emotional intent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy combining these two expressions, we can see that how the combined genre seeks to keep the Happiness of the protagonist low, the Fear and Surprise higher, and leveling between Anger, Contempt, and Disgust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Others achieves this balance by playing liberally with fear and anger throughout the film, with several bursts of sadness and surprise. The writer keeps most of the contempt and disgust away from the protagonist until the end of the film, when the mystery is revealed, and the protagonist fully understands their role in the story.\n\n# An Introduction to the Household\n\nThe Others opens with flickering, hand-drawn credits illustrated in a style reminiscent of candlelight on 1940s woodcut, laying out the house and home that once was, and allowing us to understand what was once familiar and safe, and the importance of its loss.\n\nIt plays fondly over the history of the house and family who live there, giving you a sense of empathy for the people who seem surrounded by darkness. Indeed, the darkness penetrates inside this house, as its curtains must be drawn to protect several inhabitants from light. Its doors are sequentially locked, initially as a protective mechanism, but this also gives the impression of entrapment. Grace (the mother, portrayed Kidman) and the two children are introduced through these illustrations, while most other characters are introduced near the start of the first act, where we find out that we are in a story set in the year after the end of World War 2.\n\n# Grace as a Virtue &amp; The Sympathetic Protagonist\n\nWe have “no way to get into the story if we don’t on a subconscious level become the hero of that story. And that’s what the empathy and the identification you create at the beginning is going to do.\n\n- Hauge (2017)\n\nIn his work on emotive storytelling, Karl Inglesis (2011) discussed the importance of having engaging protagonists in other to guide us through our stories. He identifies three major areas in which we begin to care about the character — those of humanistic values, those with desirable qualities, and those who are victims.\n\nGrace, as the lead character, is named after a traditional Virtue and, throughout the film, Kidman seeks to embody these graceful mannerisms into her movements. She seeks to be morally conservative, guiding the children through Bible lessons, acting in a nurturing (if strict) fashion, and tries to be dependable, loyal and responsible, and also offers work to those who seek it — all very strong values for the period in which the movie is set.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShe is also introduced as a trapped as victim of circumstance and gender — her husband has gone away to war, her servants have curiously abandoned her, and she is in a house so large that she eagerly accepts the offer of help from three strangers. She is honest about needing help, playing briefly with the heavily gendered role of distressed mother, before moving ahead and taking charge of her role within the story.\n\nFinally, we also see Grace displaying a tenaciousness and perseverance throughout the film, refusing to let barriers be placed in her way, and also she is looked up to as a leader — with everyone in the house obeying her even when they disagree with her (or so we are lead to think).\n\nShe is portrayed as a strong younger mother, widowed (and therefore not “immoral” by standards of the period), raising two young children despite bitter circumstance, and we immediately start to see why her story is important in questioning the gender roles of previous eras.\n\n# Archetypes as Foils\n\nThere are several other archetypes that Grace plays off, two “maidens”, one the wilful daughter, who it turns out may be more emotionally mature than her mother, and a silent maid who seems to embody traditional feminine duties and quiet compliance. A younger, sensitive, fearful, brother also serves to highlight his sister’s bravery and acts as a questioning, sceptical character, who knows something is wrong, but struggles to express it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere is also a traditional wiser woman character, who takes on the role of the children’s protective Nanny, but who also acts as a shield for Grace from the emotional shocks of revelation that come about through the story. She collaborates with an older male character, and together they conceal aspects of the story from the protagonist, but also give the audience insight that the other characters do not possess.\n\nThe final archetype in this story is the absent father who, even when he returns home from war, does little to assist with the story. He is emotionally distant from all the other characters, and leaves abruptly, and acts more like a prop for others to play against than a character with real emotions or desires beyond depression and duty.\n\n# House as Character\n\nIn traditional ghost stories, the House itself often becomes a character of its own (Goldstein et al., 2007). The Others’ House is initially introduced as large and noble, having resisted the German attempts to shatter its peace during wartime, but we quickly realize this safety has become claustrophobic. We learn during a brief introduction that the house is as trapped and isolated as its inhabitants, surrounded as it is by iron gates and mist, cut off the modern era’s electricity, radio and so we begin to understand why Grace must leave it to brave the Fog to keep her family safe.\n\n# Seeking Virtue, &amp; Acknowledging the Flaw\n\nThis collective entrapment of the characters grounds our empathy for Grace and later helps us to follow her emotionally when she leaves the house to enter the Fog, ignoring the warnings of the wise old servants. She is seeking the services of a priest (representing virtue, redemption and ), which helps us to engage emotionally with the protagonist’s quest — she is being protective of the children in her care, even though she would be traditionally judged for “abandoning” them, by the standards of the day.\n\n# Entering the Fog — the Emotional Journey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpon entering the mist, Grace (Kidman) strides confidently between the tall, upright trees, ignoring the warnings of the servants (who themselves are framed against a crooked and twisted tree, implying a threat, and who actively cover up a gravestone).\n\nThe servants have warned each other about “the Fog”, and it begins to engulf her, hiding the path, and deadening any sound except her own ragged, fearful breaths. The fog forms both a backdrop and a wall in this scene, in a very similar fashion to horror films of the 1940s, such as The Wolf Man (Waggner, 1941).\n\nThese all add to the ratcheting tension when we hear a rattling like chains, and see a faint outline looms threateningly out of the fog, until resolves itself into the person she loves, the person she’s needed, her Husband who’s finally returned from the war, the clinking of his baggage being the rattling she was so wary of.\n\nGrace loses her previous control, and she moves quickly to him clutching first her face, and then him. Her movements and speech in the scene are reminiscent of the distressed damsel found so often in traditional horror works, and she seems even to be weakened by his presence.\n\nThe husband doesn’t play to the traditional, masculine heroic saviour role in this scene, however — he’s barely able to speak and articulate his words. He is not in control, seeming barely present, almost completely lost himself (which becomes more and more apparent after this scene). Grace barely notices his absence, however, as she is too overcome with relief and hope.\n\nThese emotions are most expressed in the gasps of her breath and the relief in her voice and face. Her husband is not so relieved, and it seems possible he knows more of what is going on than she does, although he is still powerless and wounded.\n\nAfter a brief exchange, where he remains disconnected, they walk back towards the house, with her almost physically supporting him.\n\n## Tension Outline\n\n· Initial Peak — Conspiracy &amp; Foreshadowing\n\n· Trough — Walking Peacefully\n\n· Rising Tension — Enclosing Mist\n\n· Peak — Sounds In The Mist\n\n· Release — Embrace Of The Familiar\n\n· Twist — The Familiar Is Wounded\n\n· Resolution — Walking Home\n\n# Breathing As Emotion And Story\n\nHeavy breathing is often used in horror films as an audio cue indicating fear, reinforcing and grounding us within an actors’ performance, and often occurs in response to an external terror (Soderburg, 2009). In The Others, however, the trope of heavy breathing is also foreshadowing a plot twist that occurs right at the end of the film — the breathing is ragged because of an emotionally important unknown that has already happened, rather than as an indicator of a character’s emotional response to events occurring onscreen.\n\nThis use of breathy foreshadowing and emotional concealment, using common film techniques, means that the final pay-off of the plot twist of the film gains more emotional weight. It means that we realize that we should have been paying more attention to the emphasis of our non-visual senses, rather than just watching the story play out on screen, and engages us with the ending.\n\n# Deadened Sound, Deadened Colour\n\nThroughout the scene, we note that there are very minimal background noises and musical stings, seeking to emphasize the emotional isolation and importance of each sound.\n\nBefore this scene, Grace idly commented that “it has been a week” since she has heard birdsong. During the rising tension of the scene, we become acutely aware of this absence of natural sounds in the scene, which only serves to heighten the sense of isolation and loneliness already present, and to illustrate exactly how wrong things have gotten within the emotional journey.\n\nSimilar too, the colour of this scene is grey and stark, contrasting with the often warm of the candlelight we left behind inside the house.\n\nIt is only when the husband enters the scene that we start to see to lighter colours introduced, until we finally see a slightly brighter outline around the two as they reach an emotional equilibrium.\n\n# Camerawork and associated Emotions\n\nWithin the selected sequence, we initially witness a dialogue between the two foil characters openly discussing how they are concealing the greater truth from Grace. This is shot using a wide, open shot (indicating some final transparency), which then zooms into the key object that they are concealing — a gravestone — a shocking revelation within the greater scope of the film.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis brief scene illustrates to us the importance of what Grace is doing in the next scene, walking quickly and openly down a road. The camera then tightens and whirls around her, giving us a visual sense of the isolation and disorientation that she is experiencing.\n\nThe shot then resolves and focuses onto the mysterious clinking sound and blurry, looming figure, sharpening our attention on the threat that is just outside our senses, prickling our sense of fear.\n\nAs the figure emerges, Grace’s emotions rapidly transform in a tight frame on her face, taking us on a journey between shock, hope and relief, before including her husband in the frame.\n\nThe camera then cuts back and forth between the two characters perspectives, illustrating the complex conflict and resolution that is happening between the two characters. Finally, we see them both in profile, balancing their perspectives and sharing their emotions between the two.\n\nThe closing sequence of the scene shows the couple slowly walking up the path to their home, together finally, before the camera slips down behind the iron gates which again imprison them and keep them separate from the wider world.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Others is a story that isn’t afraid to explore the emotional ghosts of traditional gender roles. It does this through layers of history and metaphor, using common archetypes and older film techniques, but still manages to tell a compelling emotional story about the role of women in post-war Europe, and the horrors that they must have experienced when they lost their loved ones to the Front.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nAmenábar, A.

Through my work and passion for visual storytelling, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the craft of cinematography and its power to shape narratives. Running my color grading suite, Color Culture, has given me countless opportunities to study and enhance the visual language of films. One of the films I’ve always admired, both as an artist and as a viewer, is Fargo (1996). Roger Deakins’ cinematography in this Coen Brothers classic is a masterclass in restraint, subtlety, and storytelling through visuals. In this article, I’ll share my personal analysis of Fargo’s cinematography, exploring its various elements and how they serve to elevate the film’s narrative.\n\n## Cinematography Analysis Of Fargo\n\n### About the Cinematographer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRoger Deakins, the legendary cinematographer behind Fargo, is known for his ability to blend technical mastery with artistic subtlety. His collaboration with the Coen Brothers has produced some of the most visually striking films of the modern era. With Fargo, Deakins approached the bleak, snowy landscape of Minnesota with an eye for simplicity and realism. His minimalist yet evocative style captures not just the physical desolation of the setting but also the moral ambiguity of the characters. As a filmmaker, I’ve always admired Deakins’ ability to use visuals not to overpower a story but to subtly enhance it, creating frames that linger in the viewer’s mind long after the film ends.\n\n### Inspiration for the Cinematography of Fargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe visual aesthetic of Fargo is rooted in its stark and minimalist approach. Deakins and the Coen Brothers were inspired by the barren, snow-covered Midwest, a landscape that mirrors the cold detachment and moral complexity of the film’s characters. The film’s use of monochromatic white expanses reflects the indifference of nature to human folly. This minimalist approach keeps the focus on the characters and their actions while grounding the surreal events in a tangible reality.\n\nI’ve often drawn inspiration from this approach in my work, particularly the idea of letting the environment play an active role in storytelling. The barren snowfields of Fargo aren’t just a backdrop—they are a character, an extension of the film’s themes of isolation and futility.\n\n### Camera Movements Used in Fargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeakins’ camera work in Fargo is deliberately restrained, emphasizing stillness and simplicity. The lack of dynamic camera movements reflects the frozen, unchanging nature of the snowy landscape. When the camera does move, it does so with purpose—tracking shots that follow characters, slow zooms that heighten tension, and subtle pans that draw the viewer into the narrative.\n\nOne scene that stands out to me is when Jerry Lundegaard scrapes ice off his windshield. The tight, cramped framing contrasts sharply with the wide, open landscapes seen elsewhere, visually reflecting Jerry’s inner turmoil against the vast indifference of the world. As a filmmaker, I find this approach incredibly effective—it’s a reminder that camera movement should always serve the story, not distract from it.\n\n### Compositions in Fargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe compositions in Fargo are a masterclass in using negative space and balance to reflect characters’ emotional states. Deakins often frames characters in the lower third of the screen, dwarfed by vast, empty expanses of snow. This visual isolation mirrors their existential struggles, emphasizing their smallness and insignificance in the grander scheme of things.\n\nFor me, one of the most striking aspects of the compositions is the use of symmetry to underscore emotional connections. Marge Gunderson and her husband, Norm, are often framed together in two-shots, symbolizing their harmonious relationship. In contrast, Jerry is frequently framed alone or with others at a distance, reflecting his growing alienation. This careful use of framing and composition is something I strive to emulate in my own work—it’s proof that subtle visual cues can speak volumes about character dynamics.\n\n### Lighting Style of Fargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe naturalistic lighting in Fargo enhances its grounded narrative while maintaining its stark, bleak tone. The pervasive whiteness of the snow creates a high-key lighting effect, bathing the exteriors in a cold, sterile light. This contrast between the harsh daylight and the dark deeds of the characters heightens the absurdity of the narrative.\n\nInteriors, however, are often lit with warm, dim lighting, creating a sense of comfort and intimacy—particularly in scenes featuring Marge and Norm. As a colorist, I admire the balance between these lighting styles. The warmth of the interiors serves as a visual reprieve from the cold, harsh exteriors, reinforcing the emotional core of the film. This interplay between light and shadow, while subtle, creates a powerful contrast that adds depth to the storytelling.\n\n### Lensing and Blocking of Fargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeakins’ choice of lenses and meticulous blocking play a crucial role in Fargo’s visual storytelling. Wide-angle lenses are often used to capture the vastness of the snowy landscapes, emphasizing the characters’ isolation. Telephoto lenses, on the other hand, compress the depth of field, creating a sense of entrapment and detachment.\n\nBlocking is equally precise, with characters positioned to reflect power dynamics and relationships. For instance, Jerry is often shown at a lower level or framed behind other characters, visually underscoring his inferiority and lack of control. In contrast, Marge’s framing reflects her strength and authority, with her often positioned in commanding stances. These subtle choices in lensing and blocking are a testament to Deakins’ mastery, and they inspire me to think critically about how such elements can enhance narrative themes.\n\n### Color Pallete of Fargo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe color palette of Fargo is another aspect that stands out for its restrained yet effective approach. The film’s palette is dominated by whites, grays, and muted earth tones, reflecting the starkness of the environment and the bleakness of the story. The occasional use of warm hues—such as the soft yellow glow of a lamp or the deep red of blood on snow—creates striking contrasts that draw attention to key moments.\n\nAs a colorist, I find the interplay between warm and cool tones in Fargo particularly inspiring. The subtle shifts in color temperature between scenes create a visual rhythm that supports the film’s emotional beats. It’s a reminder of how color grading can serve as an invisible yet powerful storytelling tool.\n\n### Technical Aspects of Fargo\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Fargo exemplifies the power of simplicity. Shot on 35mm film with Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses, the film captures a tactile, organic quality that enhances its realism. Deakins’ preference for natural light and practical setups ensures that the visuals remain grounded and authentic.\n\nThe editing by Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for the Coens) complements the cinematography perfectly, maintaining a seamless flow that lets the visuals speak for themselves. The sound design, with its ambient noises of wind and snow crunching underfoot, further immerses the viewer in the film’s world. These technical choices serve as a reminder that simplicity, when executed with precision, can be just as impactful as elaborate techniques.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor me, Fargo represents a benchmark in visual storytelling. Roger Deakins’ cinematography is a testament to the power of restraint and subtlety, proving that profound emotional and thematic depth can be achieved through simplicity. From its stark compositions to its nuanced color grading, every visual element of Fargo works in harmony to support the Coen Brothers’ vision.\n\nAs a filmmaker and colorist, I find endless inspiration in this film. It’s a reminder that every frame is an opportunity to tell a story, and that even the smallest visual choices can leave a lasting impact. Fargo is more than just a film—it’s a lesson in the art of crafting timeless cinema.\n\n- Also Read: CINEMATOGRAPHY ANALYSIS OF EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE\n- Also Read: CINEMATOGRAPHY ANALYSIS OF EUPHORIA (IN DEPTH)\n\n## Leave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

            "spanned_content": "<article>\n    <title>Cinematography Analysis Of <Name>Fargo</Name> (In Depth)</title>\n    <author>by Salik Waquas</author>\n    <section>\n        <paragraph>\n            My name is Salik Waquas, and I am a filmmaker and a full-time film colorist. Through my work and passion for visual storytelling, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the craft of cinematography and its power to shape narratives. Running my color grading suite, Color Culture, has given me countless opportunities to study and enhance the visual language of films. One of the films I’ve always admired, both as an artist and as a viewer, is <Name>Fargo</Name> (1996). <Director>Roger Deakins</Director>’ cinematography in this Coen Brothers classic is a masterclass in restraint, subtlety, and storytelling through visuals. In this article, I’ll share my personal analysis of <Name>Fargo</Name>’s cinematography, exploring its various elements and how they serve to elevate the film’s narrative.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <header>About the Cinematographer</header>\n        <paragraph>\n            <Director>Roger Deakins</Director>, the legendary cinematographer behind <Name>Fargo</Name>, is known for his ability to blend technical mastery with artistic subtlety. His collaboration with the Coen Brothers has produced some of the most visually striking films of the modern era. With <Name>Fargo</Name>, <Director>Deakins</Director> approached the bleak, snowy landscape of Minnesota with an eye for simplicity and realism. His minimalist yet evocative style captures not just the physical desolation of the setting but also the moral ambiguity of the characters. As a filmmaker, I’ve always admired <Director>Deakins</Director>’ ability to use visuals not to overpower a story but to subtly enhance it, creating frames that linger in the viewer’s mind long after the film ends.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <header>Inspiration for the Cinematography of <Name>Fargo</Name></header>\n        <paragraph>\n            The visual aesthetic of <Name>Fargo</Name> is rooted in its stark and minimalist approach. <Director>Deakins</Director> and the Coen Brothers were inspired by the barren, snow-covered Midwest, a landscape that mirrors the cold detachment and moral complexity of the film’s characters. The film’s use of monochromatic white expanses reflects the indifference of nature to human folly. This minimalist approach keeps the focus on the characters and their actions while grounding the surreal events in a tangible reality.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <header>Camera Movements Used in <Name>Fargo</Name></header>\n        <paragraph>\n            <Director>Deakins</Director>’ camera work in <Name>Fargo</Name> is deliberately restrained, emphasizing stillness and simplicity. The lack of dynamic camera movements reflects the frozen, unchanging nature of the snowy landscape. When the camera does move, it does so with purpose—tracking shots that follow characters, slow zooms that heighten tension, and subtle pans that draw the viewer into the narrative.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <header>Compositions in <Name>Fargo</Name></header>\n        <paragraph>\n            The compositions in <Name>Fargo</Name> are a masterclass in using negative space and balance to reflect characters’ emotional states. <Director>Deakins</Director> often frames characters in the lower third of the screen, dwarfed by vast, empty expanses of snow. This visual isolation mirrors their existential struggles, emphasizing their smallness and insignificance in the grander scheme of things.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <header>Lighting Style of <Name>Fargo</Name></header>\n        <paragraph>\n            The naturalistic lighting in <Name>Fargo</Name> enhances its grounded narrative while maintaining its stark, bleak tone. The pervasive whiteness of the snow creates a high-key lighting effect, bathing the exteriors in a cold, sterile light. This contrast between the harsh daylight and the dark deeds of the characters heightens the absurdity of the narrative.\n        </paragraph>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <header>Lensing and Blocking of <Name>Fargo</Name></header>\n        <paragraph>\n            <Director>Deakins</Director>’ choice of lenses and meticulous blocking play a crucial role in <Name>Fargo</Name>’s visual storytelling.

            "Plot Summary": "In an alternate 2008, <b>Tasya Vos</b> is an assassin who takes control of other people's bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos' consciousness is inserted into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of the job, although the movie's intro sequence has her deviate from her protocol and struggling to commit suicide by her own gun, getting the host shot by shooting at arriving police forces instead. Vos struggles with neurological symptoms and increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, <b>Michael</b>, and son, <b>Ira</b>. She 'practices' assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael. Vos' handler, retired assassin <b>Girder</b>, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it. Despite her fragile mental state and fatigue, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO <b>John Parse</b> and his daughter, <b>Ava</b>, by possessing Ava's fiancé, <b>Colin Tate</b>. While assuming the host's life, the neurological symptoms worsen, but Vos hides this during her handler's check-ins. The hit is only a partial success as Ava dies, but not Parse. Vos attempts to finish the job per protocol by forcing Tate to shoot himself, but again cannot make him pull the trigger. During a dissociative break, in which Vos struggles to remain in control of Tate's body, he stabs himself in the skull, damaging the implant and causing severe neurological symptoms on Vos' own body, causing her internal physical damage. Vos discovers she can neither leave Tate's body, nor overpower his consciousness. Tate regains control, but is severely disoriented, in shock and traumatized from the violence before him, so he flees the crime scene. He seeks refuge with his friend <b>Reeta</b>, while experiencing fragmented memories of Vos' life. He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava. <b>Eddie</b>, a co-employee from Tate's workplace who reveals himself to be a plant from Vos' agency, arrives at the apartment to help Vos regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails and Tate kills Eddie during another dissociative episode in which Tate becomes aware of Vos' presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child, and home. Tate goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. Vos appears inside Tate’s mind and goads Tate into killing Michael. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver, in a similar manner as the movie's opening sequence's job. Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, killing him, also reminiscent to the opening sequence's stabbing. Vos uses Tate's last moments to shoot Ira dead, who is then revealed to also have been a host. Vos returns to her own body and discovers that it was Girder who had taken control of Ira. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, as Girder wanted. In another debriefing, Vos sorts through her personal objects again. She contemplates and recognizes the butterfly, but does not express any guilt for killing it. Girder smiles and replies, 'Very good.'",

            "Plot Summary": "In a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the kind), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The remaining population, the Factionless, holds no status or privilege. Upon turning sixteen, children undergo a serum-induced psychological aptitude test that reveals their best-suited faction, although they can choose any faction as their permanent group during the subsequent Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice Prior lives in Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew, and Abnegation's leader, Marcus Eaton, serve on the ruling council. When Beatrice was tested, her results show equal attributes of multiple factions: Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless, making her a Divergent. Her proctor Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation. She warns her to conceal her accurate results because Divergents can think independently and would threaten the existing social order. The next day, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite at the Choosing Ceremony, while she selects Dauntless. She meets Christina, Al, and Will, other faction transfers. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. A harsh Dauntless leader, Eric Colter, warns the initiates that those who fail to meet the faction's high standards will become Factionless. Beatrice jumps from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net and gaining respect from Four, a transferred instructor. Beatrice initially struggles in Dauntless training and ranks far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help, she slowly improves. Eric then matches her against her nemesis, Candor transfer Peter Hayes, in a fight that ends with Beatrice's defeat and recovery in the infirmary. Unwilling to miss the crucial Capture the Flag test, she leaves the infirmary, joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut. In the next training phase, the initiates confront their deepest fears in psychological simulations. Beatrice's divergence enables her to creatively navigate the tests, but Four cautions her to conceal her abilities and approach the challenges like a typical Dauntless would. Beatrice visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her, but Four rescues her. Al begs Tris to forgive him the next day, but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into 'The Pit'. Four takes Beatrice into his fear simulations to prepare her for the final test. There, she learns that he is Tobias Eaton and that his father, Marcus, used to beat him as a child. Beatrice then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The Dauntless recruits are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for mind control. The next day, the Dauntless prepares to attack Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who is also Divergent. When the Dauntless raids Abnegation, they split from their group to find Beatrice's parents. However, Eric captures Four, realizing he isn’t under control, and orders Beatrice's execution. Her mother, Natalie, a former Dauntless, saves her but is later shot and killed during their escape. Tris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, so Beatrice goes in alone to find Four, who is now under mind control designed for Divergents. Knowing Four's fears, Beatrice manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader, Jeanine Matthews, has Dauntless execute nearly the entire Abnegation faction. Beatrice uses a sample of the mind control serum on herself to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.",

There he is placed under the supervision of lab worker Lester to help load supplies onto an experimental rocket ship. While on board with Lester, Orville flips the ignition switch and the rocket ship blasts off, flying across the country and eventually landing outside of New Orleans, where Mardi Gras is in progress. Lester and Orville, believing that they have successfully landed on Mars, don spacesuits and go into the city, where they assume the grotesquely costumed celebrants are Martians, while the others assume they are fellow costumed celebrants. Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, Harry the Horse and Mugsy, stumble upon the rocket ship, put on spacesuits and head to New Orleans to rob a bank and steal clothes. Lester and Orville are wrongly accused of the crimes and flee back to the rocket ship, where Mugsy and Harry force them to launch and demand to actually go to Mars. However, once in outer space, Lester and Orville get control of the crooks' gun and attempt to land back on Earth. The ship instead lands on Venus, where the four men are quickly captured by female guards and brought to the ruler of the planet, Queen Allura. She informs them that Venus is inhabited only by women because men were banished long ago. She takes more than a liking to Orville and makes him her king consort on the condition that he remains true to her. Orville agrees, and has Harry and Mugsy imprisoned. However, Mugsy convinces one of the female guards to flirt with Orville to prove to Queen Allura that he cannot be trusted. Disillusioned with Orville, the Queen orders all the men to leave Venus. Upon returning to the Earth, the men are lauded as heroes in a parade, but Allura, who is watching the celebration from Venus, sends a spaceship to Earth to drop a cake on Orville's head.",

            "Plot Summary": "Joel Schumacher’s Flatliners epitomizes the sleek thrillers of the 1990s, offering an excessive visual presentation that occupies the space where a substantive commentary should go. The film follows a group of self-serious medical students who seek to explore the boundaries of the afterlife, while also testing their own overconfident abilities as would-be doctors. Using drugs to induce death, the students cause their own flatlines on a heart monitor. After a minute or so, the others resuscitate the willing participant, much to the audience’s anticipation.",
            "Themes": "The film attempts to wax philosophical about religious and philosophic views on death, exploring themes of guilt, trauma, and the consequences of one's actions.",

            "Plot Summary": "The Coen brothers' film Fargo begins with two riddles—the first, a verbal riddle about truth-telling in cinema, the second, an image riddle about whiteness.

She offers an implicit challenge to the ironic solution of the first riddle and a compelling alternative to the nihilistic drift of the second.",
