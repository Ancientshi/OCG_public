I believe, however, that horror has the potential to work on a number of different levels, both metaphorical, existential and purely visceral.  By its very nature it creates possibilities for expression of pretty complex questions about the nature of existence; more importantly it allows questioning film-makers to completely shatter any pre-existing ideas about what can be defined as normal.  Here it is used to explore and criticise society in ways no other genre can, primarily because it is much maligned and misunderstood; film-makers have the freedom to create metaphysical spaces that would be otherwise impossible. In this list I'm interested in looking at those aspects of particular films which make them stand out from the others, which make fans of those of us who are attuned to what horror sometimes tries to communicate (and alienates as many).  Horror is also  an ambiguous zone of possibility that allows experimentation with forms of representation not allowable in anything outside the avant-garde.  These days it's hard to find a horror film that really touches you deeply in the nightmarish kind of way true horror really should. The more recent Hollywood spectacles may look good but lack true depth, often providing a humanistic outlook frosted with a prudishly moral acceptance of empty concepts. In short, I rarely see anthing that more than skirts the edges of true horror. Sometimes you have to look really hard, both into the past and to films that aren't produced by the formulaic cemetery for cinema which calls itself an industry. The idea is to include some of them here.  I'm going to try to suggest in short some of the reasons why I've added them to the list (with as few spoilers as possible); the ultimate plan is to include at my website more detailed analyses and descriptions which you can find here: http://www.nachtschimmen.eu/places/projects/ESHCC. My other lists contains films that follow the rules set by Hollywood and are not necessarily awful, but should in any case be avoided by anyone who expects something cogent from the genre.  Any suggestions for this or my other list are welcome; I'd love to be made aware of more truly weird and exceptional horror films that may be worthy of this list. I'd also like to thank Frank Edelamn who is the sole creator of his astoudingly complete exploration of low-budget, exploitation and anti-Hollywood cinematic offerings in his extensive website, both well written and well-researched. He calls it, aptly, 'Critical Condition' and can be found at the following URL: http://www.critcononline.com. His site and advice helped me add many of the titles to this list.\n\nList activity\n\nCreate a new list\n\nList your movie, TV &amp; celebrity picks.\n\n- 71 titles\n\n- 1. The Fall of the House of Usher19601h 19mPG6.9 (16K)Rate75MetascoreUpon entering his fiancée's family mansion, a man discovers a savage family curse and fears that his future brother-in-law has entombed his bride-to-be prematurely.DirectorRoger CormanStarsVincent PriceMark DamonMyrna Fahey\n- 2. Carnival of Souls19621h 18mPG7.0 (29K)RateAfter a traumatic accident, a woman becomes drawn to a mysterious abandoned carnival.DirectorHerk HarveyStarsCandace HilligossFrances FeistSidney BergerTruly well-made and spooky film about a woman who during the coarse of the film gradually realises that she is dead. Made on a shoestring budget with wonderful scenes involving her seduction into the bizarre and scary 'carnival' and its set of weird characters who are metaphoric of the death awaiting us all.\n- 3. The Haunting19631h 52mA7.4 (44K)Rate74MetascoreHill House has stood for about 90 years and appears haunted: its inhabitants have always met strange, tragic ends. Now Dr. John Markway has assembled a team of people who he thinks will prove whether or not the house is haunted.DirectorRobert WiseStarsJulie HarrisClaire BloomRichard JohnsonIf you were unfortunate enough to see the dreadful remake of this film which appears more an exaggeration of this film than a readaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel, then you really should watch the original which is in stark black and white and truly scary to the extent that haunted houses that go bump in the night can be scary.  Its a good adaptation of Jackson's effective novel, and its main deviation is casting one of the psychic characters as a lesbian played by Claire Bloom.\n- 4. Night of the Living Dead19681h 36mM7.8 (145K)Rate89MetascoreA ragtag group of Pennsylvanians barricade themselves in an old farmhouse to remain safe from a horde of flesh-eating ghouls that are ravaging the Northeast of the United States.DirectorGeorge A. RomeroStarsDuane JonesJudith O'DeaKarl HardmanThe mother of all 'nature/culture' metaphor films which has a small group stuck in a typical family home trying to keep a horde of sepulchral ghouls from eating their flesh.  I still love this film, although I have to confess that I'm fond of this particular metaphor (not so much zombies).  Films like 'The Evil-Dead' and the more recent filming of Scott Smith's novel 'The Ruins' (among many others) owe a lot to this film which became a prototype to an almost endless series of sequels, imitations and finally more recent television series like 'The Walking Dead'. The acting may be campy and the horror far less violent than what we've become used to; but this somehow adds to the sense of doom on the characters, none of whom are spared the horror which envelops them and which ultimately remains unexplained. What also makes it interesting is its characterisation of its hero as a negro; although his authoritative air makes everyone trapped in the house obey his advice, they all die because of following it without question, and the very fact that he's the last to die, shot because he's feared to be one of the living dead in the title, is also indicative of racial hatred still strongly felt in a country divided by race and wealth.\n- 5. The Devils19711h 51mR7.7 (20K)Rate49MetascoreIn 17th-century France, Father Urbain Grandier's protection of the city of Loudun from the corrupt Cardinal Richelieu is undermined by a sexually repressed nun's accusation of witchcraft.DirectorKen RussellStarsVanessa RedgraveOliver ReedDudley SuttonKen Russell's film may be based on historical fact which took place in France during the Middle-Ages, it certainly is of film with horrific undertones and with the amazing acting talent of Vanessa Redgrave as the hunchback witch who falsely accuses the the renegade priest of sexual atrocities against her, a horrific unjustice takes place made more potent by a particularly strong original score by Peter Maxwell-Davies and Ken Russell's impressive use of imagery.\n- 6. Let's Scare Jessica to Death19711h 29mM6.4 (9.7K)Rate58MetascoreA recently institutionalized woman has bizarre experiences after moving into a supposedly haunted country farmhouse and fears she may be losing her sanity once again.DirectorJohn D. HancockStarsZohra LampertBarton HeymanKevin O'ConnorThe lurid title could easily side-track you from what is essentially an extremely frightening exploration of a woman's descent into madness.  You can read it, of course, in a material sense as the title suggests; but everything in this film has the potential to signify something else entirely, and its this ambiguity that makes this film so macarbe and interesting.  Everything, from the killing of the 'mole' to the conclusion during which Jessica is trapped the films ambivelent set of monsters on the middle of the lake on a barely floating boat (classic metaphor for human consciousness and mental health) communicates on different levels.  The fact that there is no ultimate explanation for the strange set of phenomena that take place is also demonstrative of the horrific and inexplicable quality of psychotic behaviour for those suffering from schizophrenia (for those of us that have had the misfortune to experience it) or the side-effects of drugs.\n- 7. Daughters of Darkness19711h 27mR6.5 (7.4K)Rate74MetascoreWhile passing through a vacation resort, a newlywed couple encounters a mysterious, strikingly beautiful countess and her aide.DirectorHarry KümelStarsDelphine SeyrigJohn KarlenDanielle OuimetDelphine Seyrig plays a magnificently evil lesbian vampire in this cult film erroneously well-known for the fact that it is one of the only motion pictures ever filmed entirely on location in Ostende. With a primarily European cast, the vampire character played by Seyrig presents a convincing argument for the preference of lesbian vampire life, and is taken as the positive alternative to a violent and abusing husband - newly discovered since the couple who become the protagonists are newly wed.\n- 8. Messiah of Evil19741h 30mR6.3 (6.7K)Rate69MetascoreA young woman goes searching for her missing artist father. Her journey takes her to a strange Californian seaside town governed by a mysterious undead cult.DirectorsWillard HuyckGloria KatzStarsMichael GreerMarianna HillJoy BangAlso known under its alternative title 'Dead People', this unusual little film, although painfully dated, is in a way similar to some of the themes of 'Let's Scare Jessica to Death' where the sanity of the heroine, who in this case is searching for her father in an isolated village filled, as it turns out, with a cult of flesh-eating ghouls waiting the return of the leader who bring them on a cross-country quest of ultimate desctruction. Although allowed to leave the village because everyone knows no one will believe her, the film starts and ends in a mental institution and contains many moments of genuine cloying and unpleasant fear. It is slow-moving and ambiguous; it doesn't feel the necessity to keep you constantly excited and some of the acting is less than fantastic; but in many respects those are elements which make this film worth the effort. It's certainly a disquieting experience convincingly played at the beginning and conclusion by its head protagonist. This film also has the dubious honour of being one of the start vehicles of the porn actress 'Joy Bang', although I couldn''t specificy exactly which character she was playing.\n- 9. The Cars That Ate Paris19741h 28mM5.6 (4.6K)RateThe small town of Paris, Australia deliberately causes car accidents, then sells/salvages all valuables from the wrecks as a means of economy.DirectorPeter WeirStarsTerry CamilleriJohn MeillonKevin MilesThis film was released with title 'The Cars that Ate Paris' and was the first part of the Peter Weir trilogy of horror films that at the time received funding from the Australian government, a blessing which resulted in lesser-known but no less deserving of attention classics like this. It explores a given that can be understood in Australian context; the vast expanse of territory allows the givens of this film to be imaginable, picturing a country bumpkin village situated in the middle of nowhere filled with inhabitants who make their living by setting traps to cause car accidents for innocent travellers who happen to make the unfortunate mistake of driving too close to the city. The wrecks are salvaged, and if the victims are unfortunate enough to survive, they become the experimentation fodder for a mad-doctor who promptly lobotomises them. This surreal environment has become metaphoric for a world strangled by technology; in an Australian-sense it also expresses the nightmare trapped feeling of being isolated in a world of mediocrity; the ending which has the youth taking a bizarre revenge by destroying the village with the imaginatively designed monster-like cars they've created from the wrecks that previously were the cities livelihood, is truly appropriate for the films thematic content and intention and this film certainly deserves its place on any list of horror cult classics; films that may seem extremely weird, but as time passes seem to make more sense as an overpopulated world becomes consumed by its obsession for wealth, oil and material gain. The two other horror films in the trilogy were 'Picnic at Hanging Rock', further on in this list, and 'The Last Wave', a far less successful venture into aboriginal mythology (but still worth a look).\n- 10. Peopletoys19741h 28mR5.0 (2.1K)RateAfter five mentally defective children survive a van accident in the snow, they make their way to a lodge where they start killing adults who offend them or are rude to them.DirectorsSean MacGregorDavid SheldonStarsSorrell BookeGene EvansTaylor LacherThe seventies was a strange era of film-making and a lot of experimentation took place by masters of the era like Pasolini. Then you had lesser-known gems like the 'The Little Girl who Lives Down the Lane', 'The Effect of Radiation on Man in the Moon Marigolds' and 'Devil Times Five' aka 'Peopletoys'.  This second title, evidently the one chosen initially by the film makers doesn't seem to make much sense; why fuse two words together in this context? The children, although representing the stereotypes of adults they base their sense of selves upon, are all flesh and blood and not at all toy like.  The climactic seconds of the film, which interestingly, is concluded instead with the ominous words 'the beginning', explains exactly the Peopletoys being referred to in the title; it took me the whole length of the film to work that one out but in retrospect it makes the conclusion precariously obvious and is explicative of why the film is better known under its more popular heading, Devil Times Five, a title which gives little away about what is the motivation behind the action of the children.  Devil Times Five is interesting because its collection of characters are quirky and human and the five psychopathic children who murder without conscience are logical caricatures of the adult world they believe they have the right to wreak havoc upon.  With the dubious honour of having as its executive producer Jordan Wank, this film makes imaginative use of colour and slow motion in ways that probably seemed unique in the seventies. If you believe that children have the real potential to commit 'evil' acts and if you enjoy films with shirt-ripping, breast-exposing cat-fights, then you'll love this extremely strange and violent romp as the set of adults trapped in the wintry isolated mansion of its over-bearing and extremely wealthy owner 'Papa Doc' who keeps going on about how hard he works and how little education he needed to achieve that wealth, then you'll enjoy this film which is gradually forming a well-deserved cult. The children, normally seen as the joy of the present and the hope for the future, spend the last third of this film ripping Papa Doc's rather loathsome American dream into pieces, and turning the adults into the very dead playthings of the five children who are then free to move on to their next conquest. It's interesting to note that one of the young male psychopaths, years before Silence of the Lambs would make the subject a taboo, likes to dress as a girl, is obsessed with his beauty and fantasises about seducing one of the older men.\n- 11. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre19741h 23mR7.4 (196K)Rate91MetascoreFive friends head out to rural Texas to visit the grave of a grandfather. On the way they stumble across what appears to be a deserted house, only to discover something sinister within. Something armed with a chainsaw.DirectorTobe HooperStarsMarilyn BurnsEdwin NealAllen DanzigerDespite the endless array of sequels and remakes that could make the original seem rather tacky and outdated, I still find this film to be highly shocking.  Tobe Hooper did something new; based very loosely on the Ed Gein case, a group of people on tour in the American heartlands make a wrong-turn and end up meeting violent deaths at the hands of a group of savage and crazy lunatics. I can't say I enjoyed watching this film; but despite its being dated it still shocked me and provided the horror genre with an entirely new direction. From right at the beginning when the disabled man is savagely and brutally killed to the bloody and screaming escape of the single heroine at the end, a rivetting sense of tension and distaste is held and even if you find the subject matter as revolting as I did it's hard not to pay attention to it and give it the respect it deserves. It actually has about as much to do with the Ed Gein case as Psycho does; but its surprising what imaginative film-makers can do with rather unpleasant truths.\n- 12. Picnic at Hanging Rock19751h 55mG7.4 (43K)Rate81MetascoreDuring a rural summer picnic, a few students and a teacher from an Australian girls' school vanish without a trace. Their absence frustrates and haunts the people left behind.DirectorPeter WeirStarsRachel RobertsAnne-Louise LambertVivean GrayOn Valentine's day in Victorian-era Australia a group from a local girls' boarding school head off for a picnic in the bush.  Three of the girls and one of the teachers go off for a walk and disappear, never to be seen again. The film begins with images focussing on the eroticism of the girls who are bursting into puberty; as natural forces collide with material ones, the rock of the title undresses and consumes them. The rest of the film concerns the complex ways this event plays off in the lives of the ones left behind. Haunting evocation of the horror inherent in an unfriendly and indifferent environment.\n- 13. Shivers19751h 27mR6.3 (25K)Rate58MetascoreThe residents of a suburban high-rise apartment building are infected by parasites that turn them into mindless nymphomaniac fiends.DirectorDavid CronenbergStarsPaul HamptonJoe SilverLynn LowryThis is perhaps Cronenberg's most controversial film which managed to completely escape the censors, since it was classed down as a video nasty and was therefore not considered to be attempting to achieve anything higher than shock value. Like 'Rabid', it went to second feature drive-in emissions or straight onto VHS.  The subject, however, is extremely pernicious and challenging. It concerns a doctor who is experimenting on dabbling with genetics, the manipulation of flesh and pederasty where a doctor basically creates worm like creatures that enter the body through the sexual organs and turn the victim into a sex maniac.  Set in a modern Toronto complex, the new type of living that was fashionable at that time, the inhabitants of the building become part of an experiment that goes dreadfully wrong.  Here the relationship between outbursts of sexual expression, disease and some of the problematic ideas suggested manage to be hidden under what could equally be viewed as a slimy monster movie that turns the flat residents into undead like things. Very interesting and worthy of further analysis.\n- 14. The Tenant19762h 6mM7.5 (49K)Rate71MetascoreA bureaucrat rents a Paris apartment where he finds himself drawn into a rabbit hole of dangerous paranoia.DirectorRoman PolanskiStarsRoman PolanskiIsabelle AdjaniMelvyn DouglasPolanski directed and starred in this remarkable and haunting film about obsession and death; I found it original and interesting - and really quirky.  Rosemary's Baby was a frightening film; but it was based on a silly novel by Ira Levin - its the actors and direction that make it unique.  This film, however, is entirely unique.  Shelley Winters, in what must have been one of her last roles, plays a subdued landlord while the tenant played by Polanski becomes obsessed with the woman who died in the apartment he lives in.  Things are left unexplained and as the haunting terror reaches its conclusion, we are left to wonder why the protagonist throws himself out the window, and after surviving this first attempt, crawls, heavily injured up the stairs, still dressed in the female clothing he's wearing, and throws himself out again!\n- 15. Eraserhead19771h 29mM7.3 (136K)Rate87MetascoreHenry Spencer tries to survive his industrial environment, his angry girlfriend, and the unbearable screams of his newborn mutant child.DirectorDavid LynchStarsJack NanceCharlotte StewartAllen JosephIf you like surrealistic horror metaphor films, this one has a lot of potential for you. Don't mistake it for an 'art'-film, although it has been put in that category by many. The statements it makes about the world we live in, both through imagery, metaphor and sound, are in themselves horrific.\n- 16. Full Circle19771h 38mM6.2 (3.3K)Rate57MetascoreAfter her daughter's death, wealthy American homemaker Julia Lofting moves to London to restart her life. All seems well until she is haunted by the ghosts of other children while mourning for her own.DirectorRichard LoncraineStarsMia FarrowKeir DulleaTom ContiPeter Straub is one of my favourite writers of horror and Full Circle [aka The Haunting of Julia] (1977) is the best adaptation into film I’ve seen of his work.  It has all the elements of a ghost story, so many in fact that on a superficial review of the exposition you could be fooled into thinking it is a clone of films involved with hauntings.  Like The Changeling (1980) – a highly competent haunted house film - it involves a spectre attached to a location into which a recently bereaved character moves, just as the realisation of both plots have the main protagonists uncovering the dark secrets held by the house.  It’s also interesting to note that the terrible Disney adaptation of Straub called Ghost Story (based flimsily on the complex novel of the same name) tries and so dismally fails to make the extremely complex and frightening horror narrative weaved by Straub interesting precisely because they tried to turn it into the ‘ghost story’ it most certainly wasn’t.  This film, however, doesn’t shy away from the horrible secrets haunting the past or any of the taboo subjects that are touched on in the book; the idea of evil children is hardly new, but suggesting a pre-pubescent child could have physical and sexual charisma to attract other children to help her perform evil deeds and sexual acts wouldn’t be so easily touched upon today, in a world so horrified by the fact that children can have access to the internet and pornography, let alone commit sexual acts.  This film is multi-facetted and interesting but hasn’t received the attention it deserved.   \nWatching Julia Lofting, played perfectly by Mia Farrow, being subsumed by her obsession with the evil child she is ultimately responsible for evoking, is one of growing dread.   Tales of haunting like The Changeling involve resolution and restitution; this film, is filled with a dense atmosphere and a growing sense of dread.  There’s nothing nice, logical or justified about the resolution longed for and attained by the nasty little spectre in this film.  More comparable to the Japanese Ju-On which similarly involves a malevolent spirit, almost everyone involved falls victim.\nThe title of the film also intrigued me. I thought initially it must have had something to do with the author’s intentions because I read a book with the same name.  On rewatching  the film, however, I noticed straightaway that the film was actually a screenplay based on an adaptation of Straub’s Julia.  After a little research I discovered that the book was republished with the film’s title, so I imagine the two parties involved in adapting the book for the screen, attempted to redirect the attention of the audience towards the narrative, one which involves a cycle revolving around an evil child and the revenge it takes upon those who had let her down in life; I’m also reminded of the haunting shot that ends the film: the camera circles around the main character, panning to reveal the bloody and circular wound cutting Julia’s throat leaving her very dead. The alternative title, The Haunting of Julia, although more descriptively accurate of the film’s contents and the author’s original title, is far less intriguing.\n This film has been compared to Roeg’s Don’t Look Now (1973), and although the plot shares a few aspects, the mourning of a dead child and obsessed parents searching for a ghostly apparition, but the comparisons between the two stop there; Roeg’s lingering obsession with shots of the film’s location (Venice) and the physical presence of its two competent leads (Christie and Sutherland), where  Don’t Look Now lingers Full Circle  is active in realizing a very busy plot as a great number of interesting and quirky characters created by Straub are encountered as Julia gradually uncovers her involvement in the ultimate horror of an extremely nasty child she inadvertently resurrected.  Roeg’s film is also based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier; there is actually little plot to tell and so Roeg enjoys the sumptuous location which, although praised at the time, doesn’t actually say very much at all.  Full Circle doesn’t have the sumptuous colour of Don’t Look Now; if anything it presents a rather ruddy set of dark blues and browns – true to London and films of the seventies but also true to the dark themes explored in the film.  Any suggestion that Full Circle  is in a similar fashion slow-moving either didn’t pay attention to the film or allowed the complexity of the story to completely pass them by.  Full Circle constantly tells a story, whereas Don’t Look Now spends a hell of a long time teasing you into thinking you’re seeing something that actually has a story worth telling.\nAlthough the book is remarkably true to Straub’s novel and actually manages to fit in a great deal of the content, it has some moments of its own, like a scene early on in the London residence, where she’s seen building a house of cards; as the camera closes in on Julia’s face, the card house naturally topples and you see that the playing cards actually contain identical images of her dead daughter’s face.  Where the film does differ from the book, it does so mostly in ways that allow the complex story to be told without giving you the impression that you’re being fed a lot of information. No scene is wasted in revealing Straub’s narrative.  The casting of Keir Dullea as the overbearing husband Magnus was an unusual choice, but in the few scenes he has he comes across sufficiently abusive. This is one variation on Straub’s intended plot that I prefer; the alduterous and criminally abusive drunk whose primary interest in his wife is attaining power of attorney over her money, is the first to fall victim to the house whereas in the novel he undeservedly survives.  Another thing that makes the film special is the unusually pervasive score which is both haunting and at times horrific; in any case strange in its overbearing constancy.  The themes are interchanged between recorded instruments and electronic ones; when the house is dangerous the theremin-like expression of the theme dominates; it’s overbearing like the atmosphere of the house in the book which is always so hot, dank and smelly.  What makes this film worthwhile, however, is the fact that in spite of the dense plot the sense of horror develops slowly and aside from Magnus’ early death there is little actual violence or even appearances of supernatural entities – it is implied and a sense of dread gradually leads you the horrific closing of the circle suggested by the title.\n- 17.

I watched it again recently and was surprised by its provocative message, one which went by the critics and censors as it was generally sent directly to second feature drive-in films and the video nasties section when both of those places still existed. Its attraction was its star, Marilyn Chambers, who for a porn actress doesn't do a bad job. The idea of a woman having a sexual appendage, essentially penis or enlarged-clitoris like, somewhere else on her body that jumps out and bites you was quite forward thinking; and as the infection she introduces spreads it becomes an all out living dead nightmare.\n- 18.

Arguably more shocking and controversial than the Alien bursting out of John Hurt's stomach in the similarly titled film; certainly one for the most creepy films of all time, and certainly pre-dating this film.

I'm afraid I found the sequels embarrassing laughathons; and Sam Raimi has demonstrated that he can do little more than follow the Hollywood buck to film after film of horror cliché (and Spiderman? ugh).

I believe, however, that horror has the potential to work on a number of different levels, both metaphorical, existential and purely visceral. By its very nature it creates possibilities for expression of pretty complex questions about the nature of existence; more importantly it allows questioning film-makers to completely shatter any pre-existing ideas about what can be defined as normal.

For example, Vampyr ('32), Dead of Night ('45), The City of the Dead ('60), The Innocents ('61), Carnival of Souls ('62), The Haunting ('63), Kwaidan ('64), Horrors of Malformed Men ('69), Let's Scare Jessica to Death ('71), The Changeling ('80), The Beyond ('81), Lost Highway ('97), etc.\n\nWhat are some of your favorites? I'm open to contemporary films, but tend toward pre-00s and largely pre-90s titles. Genre-wise, I love ghost stories, folk horror, creature features, cosmic horror, and psychological horror, but these examples by no means exhaust my palate for the macabre and the uncanny.

It has since been updated with new entries.\n\nShort of outright sobs, there are just two sounds you’ll hear coming from movie theaters: laughter and screams. When filmmakers can successfully elicit both — running horror-loving audiences through emotional minefields that chase each adrenaline spike with just enough comedic relief to set them up for another shock — their films take on an almost electric quality. Just thinking of the stunning yet silly reveals in genre staples like “Shaun of the Dead” or “The Cabin in the Woods” can zap a smile on your face, and leave you itching to rewatch other memorable scenes and scares from your favorite funny yet spooky movies.\n\nThere’s considerable debate about which title merits being called the first horror comedy. Numerous shorts, including the 1920 silent film “Haunted Spooks,” might qualify. But by the time Bud Abbott and Lou Costello joined the Universal Monster Movies in “Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,” the horror comedy was firmly established as hallowed cinematic ground.\n\nIn the ’70s and ’80s, film talents from Vincent Price to John Landis joined in the fiendish fun with titles like “The Abominable Dr. Phibes” and “An American Werewolf in London.” Not long after, “Elvira: Mistress of the Dark,” “Evil Dead II,” “Re-Animator,” “They Live,” and more classics popped onto the scene. Horror comedy musicals of that era have been especially enduring, with “Rocky Horror Picture Show,” “Young Frankenstein,” and “Little Shop of Horrors” baiting the Broadway crowd into visiting the dark side.\n\nOf course, the horror-comedy genre really belongs to the films of the ’90s. Wes Craven broke the mold with the 1996 titan “Scream.” It was followed not much later by the Wayans brothers’ stupidly hysterical “Scary Movie” series. With such fruitful, frightful territory already explored, horror comedies are a dime a dozen these days: packing an already overstuffed market with nightmares that might be funny and scary, but too often make a mess while managing neither.\n\nThroughout the 21st century, the best horror comedy movies have set themselves apart by lambasting both the tropes of the horror genre and the genuine fears from which those tropes emerged. Genre-defying marvel “Get Out” saw Jordan Peele find the humor in humanity’s hatred. Karyn Kusama’s cult classic “Jennifer’s Body” boasted an unprecedented revenge arc that just so happened to include a man-eating cheerleader. Recent horror comedy heavyweights include Halina Reijn’s “Bodies Bodies Bodies,” a social media-fueled shitshow you’ll love and Zach Cregger’s “Barbarian,” which is only funny for an act but memorable enough to merit inclusion.\n\nWithout further ado (and without any franchise repeats), here are the 35 best horror comedy movies of the 21st century.\n\n- 35. ‘M3gan’ (2023)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: ©Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nOne of the rare January horror film releases to actually satisfy, ‘M3gan’ and its knowing camp made it catnip for horror fans upon its 2023 release. The primary target for the memes generated by the Blumhouse release was the titular doll-android itself, a Tiktok dancing, wildly silly looking menace that begins to take horrific measures to protect her young charge Cady (Violet McGraw). But Gerard Johnstone’s film really shines when it lets Allison Williams, playing Cady’s distant aunt turned reluctant mother figure, add some subtle, underplayed comedy to the equation, from her barely disguised disinterest in parenting to the deadpan way she navigates the increasingly absurd horrors. The film is due for a sequel soon, so here’s hoping it will be able to recapture the original’s blithe magic. —WC\n- 34. ‘The Menu’ (2022)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eric Zachanowich\t\t\t\n\nMany eat-the-rich thrillers like ‘The Menu’ fail because they’re preaching to the choir: the rich we want to see fail are more cartoons than humans, and the class consciousness doesn’t extend much beyond an acknowledgment that class exists. Mark Mylod’s send-up of the fine dining world, where a group of wealthy assholes get served up a dinner from hell on an ultra-exclusive island restaurant, isn’t necessarily the deepest film ever made. What makes it great is how little that matters, as it instead uses its premise for a laugh-out-loud-funny but edge-of-your-seat comedic thriller sending up and parodying the fine dining world. Keeping everything hanging together is Ralph Fiennes, playing the head chef of the establishment where the noxious guests meet their end. He’s incredible, combining pathos with a biting, sarcastic disposition and a vicious temper that leads to some of the film’s cruelest and funniest jokes. —WC\n- 33. “Velvet Buzzsaw” (2019)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Netflix/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nFrom the whip-smart auteur behind “Nightcrawler” comes another Los Angeles-set horror story. Dan Gilroy reunites with star Jake Gyllenhaal in “Velvet Buzzsaw”: a supernatural slasher anchored in the well-to-do contemporary art world. Gyllenhaal plays a pompous art critic in a cast that also boasts Rene Russo, Toni Collette, Natalia Dyer, and John Malkovich among others. Zawe Ashton plays an ambiitous young art dealer who stumbles across a series of eerie paintings when she finds the dead body of her artist neighbor. Her decision to steal and sell the pieces sets off a string of strange events no one can explain.\n- 32. “Come to Daddy” (2019)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Jamie Leigh Gianopolous/Saban Films/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nElijah Wood stars in the nastily excellent “Come to Daddy,” horror producer Ant Timpson’s triumphant directorial debut.\nWith more twists and turns than an “I Know What You Did Last Summer” turnpike, the laugh-out-loud funny horror comedy seems at first like the story of a young man (Wood) reconnecting with his estranged father (Stephen McHattie). Thanks to a jaw-dropping script from Toby Harvard, it soon blooms into a vibrant hellscape of unforeseen enemies that’s well worth enjoying unspoiled.\n- 31. “Villains” (2019)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Gunpowder &amp;amp; Sky/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nBonnie and Clyde stand-ins Jules (Maika Monroe) and Mickey (Bill Skarsgård) get more than they bargained for when an attempted burglary leads them to find a young girl (Blake Baumgartner) chained up in an overly cheery couple’s basement. The inspired casting of Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Donovan as horror-show homeowners Gloria and George elevates writer-directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen’s double date story from believably bad to campy levels of strange and cruel. From Gloria’s increasingly touchy fascination with Mickey to George’s cryptically gentile treatment of Jules, “Villians” is chock-full of bizarre suburban terror that keeps you guessing til the bitter end.\n- 30. “The Voices” (2014)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Lionsgate/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nRyan Reynolds plays a lonely warehouse worker in “The Voices,” a colorful, spectacle-laden exploration of violent hallucinations and a murderer’s guilt.\nDirected by Marjane Satrapi and written by Michael R. Perry, the 2014 flick is most memorable for its hysterical use of a talking dog and cat: angel and devil stand-ins for the anti-hero’s conflicting sense of morality. Fittingly, the pets are also voiced by Reynolds.\nAnna Kendrick plays the main character’s blissfully unaware love interest, alongside Jacki Weaver as his increasingly concerned therapist.\n- 29. “Fresh” (2022)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Searchlight Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nDaisy Edgar-Jones, known for the hyper-romantic “Normal People,” and Sebastian Stan, nominated for an Emmy thanks to “Pam &amp;amp; Tommy,” team up with Hulu again to star in director Mimi Cave’s debut film “Fresh.”\nWritten by Lauryn Kahn, the genre-bending thriller adventures through the terrors of modern dating to reach a far more dastardly destination. After the disillusioned Noa meets the charming Steve in a grocery store, the two decide to enjoy a weekend away. What awaits isn’t for the faint of heart.\n- 28. “Bubba Ho-Tep” (2003)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nScream king Bruce Campbell delivers a surprisingly sweet performance as a still-living Elvis Presley in writer-director Don Coscarelli’s “Bubba Ho-Tep.” After the famed rock n’ roller swaps places with an impersonator for some much needed R&amp;amp;R — then the impersonator dies and a fire prevents the real Elvis from proving he’s, well, Elvis — Presley lives out his days in a Texas retirement facility under the name Sebastian Haff. It’s not until he, along with a fellow resident who believes himself to be the late John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), are forced to face off with a powerful mummy that our hunka burnin’ hero seriously looks back on his tortured legacy.\n- 27. “Zombieland” (2009)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Columbia/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nBefore “The Walking Dead” hit 2010 TV lovers with its infamous “Don’t Dead Open Inside” pilot — effectively kicking off pop culture’s more-than-decade-long obsession with extended explorations of humans surviving undead society — “Zombieland” was conquering the post-apocalyptic landscape with its own, far spunkier tale of found family.\nWhen a hoody-wearing college kid (Jesse Eisenberg) meets a snack food-obsessed cowboy-type (Woody Harrelson), an eyeliner-loving rebel (Emma Stone), and that rebel’s devilishly smart little sister (Abigail Breslin), they must come together to survive the end of the world. Rule number one: Cardio.\n- 26. The “Fear Street” Trilogy (2021)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Netflix/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nCo-written with Phil Graziadei and Zak Olkewicz, Leigh Janiak’s “Fear Street” trilogy brings just the right amount of fear and fun . When a masked killer stalks a group of friends around the town of Shadyside on Halloween night 1994, their fight to survive reveals a decades-old conspiracy that dates all the way back to the mid-17th century. Kiana Madeira, Olivia Scott Welch, Sadie Sink, Emily Rudd, Maya Hawke, and more appear in this trio of films that aren’t consistently funny, but boast enough light-hearted fare and get in enough zingers to qualify for inclusion on a best horror-comedy list.\n- 25. “Freaky” (2020)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nThe body-swap comedy gets a murderous upgrade in “Freaky,” starring Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton as a serial killer and mousy teen girl who accidentally switch bodies. Known best for “Happy Death Day,” director Christopher Landon brings his signature smarts to the simple premise, pulling thoroughly modern threads that help the standard fare feel fresh. (Plus, you have to give it up for the red leather jacket. Seriously, the red leather jacket rocks.)\n- 24. “This is the End” (2013)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Suzanne Hanover/Sony Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nWriter-directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg pulled off something of a cameo-laden miracle with “This Is the End,” a 2013 apocalypse movie imagining then-contemporary Hollywood contending with Armageddon.\nThere’s plenty that feels familiar to the duo’s past work; see the exceptionally relatable suggestion that, in the face of fear, it’d be best for them to “do all the drugs.” But what makes “This Is the End” truly awesome is its once-in-a-lifetime cast: a revolving door of visiting celebrities that includes Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Channing Tatum, Emma Watson, and even Rihanna. (“Don’t fucking touch my bum, bitch.”)\n- 23. “Barbarian” (2022)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy 20th Century/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nZach Cregger’s “Barbarian” is terrifying. And though the majority of this labyrinthian nightmare is far from funny — the first act is nothing short of a nerve-wracking assault on the senses (definitely worth seeing in a theater, by the way!) — there’s no denying this hellish abduction caper knows how to deliver a laugh. Justin Long arrives part-way through in a role reminiscent of his podcaster part for Kevin Smith’s “Tusk,” ratched up in an irredeemable #MeToo arc that doubles as a vehicle for pitch-black comedy, perfectly complimentary to the movie’s jaw-dropping main event.\n- 22. “Scream” (2022)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Paramount Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nMore than any other franchise on this list, “Scream” has packed the 21st century with horror comedy sequels worth celebrating.\nSo, with the full knowledge that recency bias may be at play here, we’re choosing “Scream” (2022) — also known as “Scream 5” — as the crowning jewel in a string of strong follow-up installments. (We’d choose “Scream” itself, but everyone knows that’s a 20th-century gem.) Love it or hate it, the film’s lambasting of “elevated horror” definitely resonates.\nJenna Ortega shines especially bright in a Casey Becker-type role, opening the film with a claustrophobic home invasion sequence that’s evocative of the original without feeling copied. Melissa Barrera fares equally well as the main protagonist, with return engagements from Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette to boot.\n- 21. “The Final Girls” (2015)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Stage 6 Films\t\t\t\n\n“Friday the 13th” meets “Pleasantville” in “The Final Girls,” an ’80s slasher sendup that sees the daughter of a late scream queen transported into her mom’s biggest movie.\nWell received but arguably still ahead of its time, director Todd Strauss-Schulson’s 2015 flick is an under-appreciated gem that makes as much of a meal out of the movie-making format as it does the occasionally clichéd content of horror movies. Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman lead as the mother-daughter duo. Nina Dobrev, Adam DeVine, Thomas Middleditch, and more also star.\n- 20. “Housebound” (2014)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: XLrator Media/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nWriter-director Gerard Johnstone tackles a hilarious premise in his 2014 horror comedy: What do you do when you’re under haunted house arrest?\nAfter the reckless Kylie (Morgana O’Reilly) attempts to steal from an ATM, she’s sentenced to eight months living with her mother (Rima Te Wiata). That tense dynamic gets only more fraught when Kylie begins experiencing supernatural phenomena possibly linked to a grisly murder.\n- 19. “Teeth” (2007)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nWriter-director Mitchell Lichtenstein’s “Teeth” is undoubtedly funnier to some audiences than others. And yet, no matter your genitalia-centric comedy tastes, there is something objectively funny about the straightforwardness of a horror protagonist battling with her own razor-sharp labia.\nJess Weixler is unapologetically great as Dawn: a god-fearing leader in a Christian abstinence group who uncovers she has a strange condition called “vagina dentata.” (Fair warning: “Teeth” explores a lot of campy territory but also includes grounded depictions of assault that can be jarring given the goofy premise.)\n- 18. “The Love Witch” (2016)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Oscilloscope/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nSamantha Robinson channels Bettie Paige, Barbara Steele, and just a touch of Elvira in writer-director Anna Biller’s hyper-femme revenge fantasy about a romance-obsessed sorceress out to find a new apple of her eye in an unsuspecting town. Flush with luxury ’60s style references and boasting timeless witchy appeal, “The Love Witch” casts its spell in two parts: luring audiences in with an earnest homage to soapy bygone cinema then cheekily upending those tropes to deliver a compelling arc that’s more contemporary in spirit.\nThere’s plenty about this transporting title that could be classified as more dramatic — possibly even tragic — than comedic, but with the campy Elaine spouting off over-the-top sexist platitudes (see “According to the experts, men are very fragile….” and “Giving men sex is a way of unlocking their love potential!”) there’s no use taking “The Love Witch” too seriously.\n- 17. “Bodies Bodies Bodies” (2022)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Gwen Capistran/A24/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nExuding an effortless online comedy style, director Halina Reijn’s “Bodies Bodies Bodies” sharpens the typical bullshit you’d see on Twitter into a fearsome spearhead for one of the funniest whodunits ever made.\nWritten by Sarah DeLappe, the very 2022 slasher introduces a tumultuous friend group (Amandla Stenberg, Myha’la Herrold, Chase Sui Wonders, Rachel Sennott, Conner O’Malley, Pete Davidson) and their seemingly caught-in-the-middle plus ones (Lee Pace, Maria Bakalova) during a party weekend set against a dangerous hurricane.\n- 16. “Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon” (2005)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nBorn of the same scary underbelly as the vicious Belgian mockumentary “Man Bites Dog,” Scott Glosserman’s “Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon” imagines a world where all your favorite slasher villains are real: Michael Meyers, Jason Voorhees, you name it.\nIn the sleepy-town of Glen Echo, a new killer is emerging: Leslie Vernon (Nathan Baesel). The titular killer invites along a journalism student (Angela Goethals) to chronicle his surprisingly entertaining attempt at infamy. Where will she draw the line between observation and accessory?\n- 15. “Trick ‘r Treat” (2007)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Warner Bros./Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nA surprisingly sweet homage to the spooky spirit of Halloween, “Trick ‘r Treat” is an anthology film from writer-director Michael Doughtery.\nThe 2007 movie is great for countless reasons: Not only does it feature performances from Anna Paquin and Brian Cox, but the closest thing you’d call a main character — Sam, a silent burlap sack-wearing being with a marked protectiveness over his favorite holiday — has risen to adorable icon status among genre fans. If there’s one horror comedy worth watching on All Hallows’ Eve, it’s this one.\n- 14. “One Cut of the Dead” (2017)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Shudder/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nA zombie movie collides with actual zombies in “One Cut of the Dead” (also known as “Kamera o Tomeru na!” or “Don’t Stop the Camera!”) Writer-director Shin’ichirō Ueda brings fierce, one-of-a-kind fun to the story of an ambitious filmmaker whose underwhelming project gets spiced up by an undead plague… sort of. “One Cut of the Dead” is mandatory viewing for fans of meta mise en scene that pumps fresh blood into not just the zombie category, but the found footage subgenre as a concept.\n- 13. “Shaun of the Dead” (2004)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Rogue Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nSimon Pegg and Edgar Wright outright nailed the zombie comedy (zombedy?) with “Shaun of the Dead,” an ambling survival saga centered on Shaun: a depressed salesman whose unlucky lot in life gets flipped upside down by a viral outbreak.\nAs you’d expect, Pegg is killer in the main role, bringing lovable sweetness to the gritty world his character inhabits. That’s in large part thanks to co-star Nick Frost, whose collaborations with Pegg would continue across “Hot Fuzz” and “The World’s End”: the other two films in Wright’s “Three Flavours Cornetto” trilogy.\n- 12. “Happy Death Day” (2017)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Studios/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\n“Groundhog Day” meets people screaming the “Happy Birthday” song at you in the maddening and hilariously repetitive “Happy Death Day,” directed by Christopher Landon and written by Scott Lobdell.\nIt looks like the end of the line for hard-partying sorority girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) when a masked murderer, dressed as her school’s creepy mascot, stabs her to death on the night of her birthday. But when she wakes up in some guy’s (Israel Broussard) bed — inexplicably for the second time — a confusing time-loop whodunnit begins. The movie got a surprisingly great sequel in 2019, titled “Happy Death Day 2U.”\n- 11. “Ready or Not” (2019)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Eric Zachanowich/Searchlight/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nMeeting the in-laws has never gone so poorly.\nSamara Weaving stars as a blushing bride suddenly fighting for her life in Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett’s “Ready or Not,” a pitch-perfect remix of the mysterious dinner party trope that sees a game of hide-and-seek enter “Most Dangerous Game” territory fast. Mark O’Brien plays the hapless groom, with Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, Melanie Scrofano, and more making up the rest of the not-exactly-happy family.\n- 10. “Slither” (2006)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nJames Gunn’s “Slither” is genuinely gross, boasting the most gut-churning scenes of any of the movies on this list. That said, if you can stomach the slipperiness, “Slither” is also one of the smartest Gunn titles to date: a mutant marriage of his goofy live-action “Scooby-Doo” sensibilities with the ruthlessness he’d cultivate in “The Suicide Squad” that top-to-bottom works.\nMichael Rooker and Elizabeth Banks lead as a man infected by an alien parasite and his suddenly tough-as-nails wife who must fight for survival alongside the rest of her South Carolina town. Nathan Fillion, Gregg Henry, Jenna Fischer, and more also appear.\n- 9. “The Cabin in the Woods” (2012)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Diyah Pera/Lionsgate/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nDrew Goddard makes his directorial debut with the unforgettable pop-up book that is “The Cabin in the Woods.” Starring Kristen Connolly, Fran Kranz, Chris Hemsworth, Jesse Williams, and Anna Hutchison, this mostly sexy zombie slasher kicks off with five college kids settling in for a fun wilderness weekend. But when two snarky technicians from a mysterious facility (a perfectly cast Bradley Whitford and characteristically excellent Richard Jenkins) offer the group as bait in an ancient ritual, an epic battle begins.\n- 8. “Scary Movie” (2000)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Miramax/Everett Collections\t\t\t\n\nFun fact: Wes Craven’s “Scream” was originally written with the title “Scary Movie” in mind. Thankfully, that franchise went with something else, and the Wayans brothers were free to build their aughts horror comedy empire.\nThe original “Scary Movie” kicked of five films’ worth of fun, spoofing, yes, “Scream” but also the likes of “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” “The Matrix,” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Dave Sheridan, Marlon Wayans, and more also star in a shock comedy that’s aged well enough (if not gracefully).\n- 7. “Tucker and Dale vs. Evil” (2010)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Dan Power/Maple Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nTucker and Dale are having a tough day.\nDirected by Eli Craig, from a script co-written with Morgan Jurgenson, “Tucker &amp;amp; Dale vs. Evil” sends up your standard hicksploitation tropes with a twist. When two well-meaning country guys (Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine) save a vacationing psych student (Katrina Bowden) from drowning in a West Virginia river, her friends assume she’s been kidnapped and decide to go after “her captors.”\n- 6. ‘The Substance’ (2024)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Christine Tamalet/MUBI\t\t\t\n\nA blunt force object of a film, Coralie Fargeat’s ‘The Substance’ is one of the least subtle movies ever made, proudly leaving everything hanging out in its send-up of the entertainment industry, misogyny, beauty standards, and addictions. That complete lack of anything resembling nuance means ‘The Substance’ isn’t the scariest film ever made, though the tale of Elizabeth Sparkle (Demi Moore) and the younger woman (Margarey Qualley) she shares her body with goes to unimaginably gory, gross-out places. It does mean that it’s incredibly funny, introducing the audience to an absurdist and knowingly stupid Los Angeles where the height of fame is hosting a Jane Fonda-esque aerobics TV show, showgirls bare T&amp;amp;A on a network New Year’s Eve show, and everything feels both modern and inflected with an ’80s sheen. While the two main actors are moving in their roles, everyone else — particularly Dennis Quaid as a campy TV executive — hams it up to overdrive, which perfectly fits with the ridiculous, laugh-out-louds lengths the film eventually goes to. When the blood finally spills at the film’s climax, you’ll laugh as much as you’ll retch. —WC\n- 5. ‘Beau Is Afraid’ (2023)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Courtesy Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nAri Aster’s first two films ‘Hereditary’ and ‘Midsommar’ contained plenty of laughs, even if most of it was awkwardness out of the sheer horror of the tragedies those nightmares depicted. His third film, ‘Beau Is Afraid,’ is something different altogether; a mammoth-length tragicomic epic that’s surreally horrifying without ever quite fitting into any genre. Starring Joaquin Phoenix as an emotionally stunted man ruled by paranoia, it’s a mesmerizingly weird odyssey from start to finish, containing horrific scenes of violence one second and exquisitely dark comedy the next. Beau’s quest to get to his mom’s funeral the first time around is plenty horrifying and funny, but both factors only ramp up when he reaches his destination; a sex scene between Phoenix and Posey encapsulates the film’s singular tone perfectly, starting out with sublime cringe comedy before ending on one of the more horrifying film images of the last decade. ‘Beau Is Afraid’ is a tricky nut to crack, but its surreal vision of the world seems to offer some sort of truth that one only has the power to laugh in the face of horror and helplessness. —WC\n- 4. “Get Out” (2017)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nYes, Jordan Peele’s triumphant “Get Out” is a horror comedy. It’s also a searing sociopolitical commentary with elements so terrifying that just calling it a horror comedy would be a laughable understatement.\n“It’s not a movie that can really be put into a genre box,” Peele argued following its classification as an outright comedy at the Golden Globes.\nHowever you define it, the Best Original Screenplay Oscar winner is a masterpiece, and Lil Rel Howery’s performance as Rod “Motherfuckin’ TSA” Williams is one of the funniest horror performances ever.\n- 3. “Jennifer’s Body” (2009)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Fox Atomic/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nAt the peak of her “Transformers” fame, Megan Fox starred in a little ol’ demonic possession flick called “Jennifer’s Body.” Directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody, the 2009 feminist fright fest was horrifically misunderstood upon release, with male audiences angry that it didn’t subvert the genre tropes they were interested in seeing subverted.\nBut hidden just beneath the surface was a heart-stopping revenge flick with plenty to say about patriarchy and power. It’s since become something of a cult classic among women and nonbinary horror fans, with particular attention paid to its brilliant queer and bisexual representation.\n- 2. “American Psycho” (2000)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: Lionsgate/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nBret Easton Ellis’ 1991 novel remains one of the more terrifying titles you’ll find on shelves, spinning a gut-wrenching tale of an ’80s New York City banker-turned-sadistic killer of women. Christian Bale acted the ever-living hell out of that premise in Mary Harron’s hard-to-stomach but still decidedly satirical “American Psycho” adaption. Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Reese Witherspoon, Matt Ross, Justin Theroux, Cara Seymour, Chloë Sevigny, and more also appear in this nightmare with an unreliable narrator.\n- 1. “What We Do in the Shadows” (2014)\n\n \n\t\t\t\tImage Credit: The Orchard/Everett Collection\t\t\t\n\nBefore Jemaine Clement spun “What We Do in the Shadows” into one of TV’s most enchanting vampire series, the Sundance mockumentary told its own tale of blood-sucking flatmates battling life’s everyday annoyances.\nWritten and directed by Clement and Taika Waititi, the 2014 horror comedy left audiences howling with laughter thanks to classic lines like “Werewolves not swear-wolves!” and “Leave me to do my dark bidding on the internet!” The former “Flight of the Conchords” collaborators also star, with Jonathan Brugh, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, Stu Rutherford, Ben Fransham, Rhys Darby, and Jackie van Beek.\n\nRead More:\n\n- Horror Comedy\n- Jordan Peele\n- Lists\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpies Like Us\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFuneral Rites and Wrongs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter Dark\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou're entering... the severed zone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterview\n\nDaily Headlines\n\nDaily Headlines covering Film, TV and more.\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\n\t\t\t\tWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

It has since been updated with new entries.</text>\n    </editorNote>\n    <content>\n        Short of outright sobs, there are just two sounds you’ll hear coming from movie theaters: laughter and screams. When filmmakers can successfully elicit both — running horror-loving audiences through emotional minefields that chase each adrenaline spike with just enough comedic relief to set them up for another shock — their films take on an almost electric quality. Just thinking of the stunning yet silly reveals in genre staples like <Name>Shaun of the Dead</Name> or <Name>The Cabin in the Woods</Name> can zap a smile on your face, and leave you itching to rewatch other memorable scenes and scares from your favorite funny yet spooky movies.\n\n        There’s considerable debate about which title merits being called the first horror comedy. Numerous shorts, including the 1920 silent film <Name>Haunted Spooks</Name>, might qualify. But by the time Bud Abbott and Lou Costello joined the Universal Monster Movies in <Name>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</Name>, the horror comedy was firmly established as hallowed cinematic ground.\n\n        In the ’70s and ’80s, film talents from Vincent Price to John Landis joined in the fiendish fun with titles like <Name>The Abominable Dr. Phibes</Name> and <Name>An American Werewolf in London</Name>. Not long after, <Name>Elvira: Mistress of the Dark</Name>, <Name>Evil Dead II</Name>, <Name>Re-Animator</Name>, <Name>They Live</Name>, and more classics popped onto the scene. Horror comedy musicals of that era have been especially enduring, with <Name>Rocky Horror Picture Show</Name>, <Name>Young Frankenstein</Name>, and <Name>Little Shop of Horrors</Name> baiting the Broadway crowd into visiting the dark side.\n\n        Of course, the horror-comedy genre really belongs to the films of the ’90s. Wes Craven broke the mold with the 1996 titan <Name>Scream</Name>. It was followed not much later by the Wayans brothers’ stupidly hysterical <Name>Scary Movie</Name> series. With such fruitful, frightful territory already explored, horror comedies are a dime a dozen these days: packing an already overstuffed market with nightmares that might be funny and scary, but too often make a mess while managing neither.\n\n        Throughout the 21st century, the best horror comedy movies have set themselves apart by lambasting both the tropes of the horror genre and the genuine fears from which those tropes emerged. Genre-defying marvel <Name>Get Out</Name> saw Jordan Peele find the humor in humanity’s hatred. Karyn Kusama’s cult classic <Name>Jennifer’s Body</Name> boasted an unprecedented revenge arc that just so happened to include a man-eating cheerleader. Recent horror comedy heavyweights include <Name>Bodies Bodies Bodies</Name>, a social media-fueled shitshow you’ll love and <Name>Barbarian</Name>, which is only funny for an act but memorable enough to merit inclusion.\n\n        Without further ado (and without any franchise repeats), here are the 35 best horror comedy movies of the 21st century.\n    </content>\n    <movie>\n        <Name>M3gan</Name>\n        <Genre>Horror Comedy</Genre>\n        <Psychological Depth>Moderate</Psychological Depth>\n        <Gore Level>Moderate</Gore Level>\n        <Dark Humor Elements>Present</Dark Humor Elements>\n        <Thrill Factor>High</Thrill Factor>\n        <Emotional Complexity>Low</Emotional Complexity>\n        <AdditionalInformation>{\"Director\": \"Gerard Johnstone\", \"Cast\": [\"Allison Williams\", \"Violet McGraw\"], \"Release Year\": 2023}</AdditionalInformation>\n        <description>One of the rare January horror film releases to actually satisfy, <Name>M3gan</Name> and its knowing camp made it catnip for horror fans upon its 2023 release. The primary target for the memes generated by the Blumhouse release was the titular doll-android itself, a Tiktok dancing, wildly silly looking menace that begins to take horrific measures to protect her young charge Cady. But Gerard Johnstone’s film really shines when it lets Allison Williams, playing Cady’s distant aunt turned reluctant mother figure, add some subtle, underplayed comedy to the equation, from her barely disguised disinterest in parenting to the deadpan way she navigates the increasingly absurd horrors. The film is due for a sequel soon, so here’s hoping it will be able to recapture the original’s blithe magic.</description>\n    </movie>\n    <movie>\n        <Name>The Menu</Name>\n        <Genre>Thriller Comedy</Genre>\n        <Psychological Depth>Moderate</Psychological Depth>\n        <Gore Level>Moderate</Gore Level>\n        <Dark Humor Elements>Present</Dark Humor Elements>\n        <Thrill Factor>High</Thrill Factor>\n        <Emotional Complexity>Moderate</Emotional Complexity>\n        <AdditionalInformation>{\"Director\": \"Mark Mylod\", \"Cast\": [\"Ralph Fiennes\"], \"Release Year\": 2022}</AdditionalInformation>\n        <description>Many eat-the-rich thrillers like <Name>The Menu</Name> fail because they’re preaching to the choir: the rich we want to see fail are more cartoons than humans, and the class consciousness doesn’t extend much beyond an acknowledgment that class exists. Mark Mylod’s send-up of the fine dining world, where a group of wealthy assholes get served up a dinner from hell on an ultra-exclusive island restaurant, isn’t necessarily the deepest film ever made. What makes it great is how little that matters, as it instead uses its premise for a laugh-out-loud-funny but edge-of-your-seat comedic thriller sending up and parodying the fine dining world. Keeping everything hanging together is Ralph Fiennes, playing the head chef of the establishment where the noxious guests meet their end. He’s incredible, combining pathos with a biting, sarcastic disposition and a vicious temper that leads to some of the film’s cruelest and funniest jokes.</description>\n    </movie>\n    <!-- Additional movies would follow the same structure -->\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have maintained the original content while wrapping relevant segments with the appropriate XML tags based on the attributes defined in the ADT.

His main idea, one that runs throughout the three-hundred plus obsessively documented pages (set in smaller than usual type), is that traditional film noir style offers tools with which a distinct black noir genre uses in order to critique 'racialised' existence. The underlying thought is that black noir utilises film noir style because the techniques that define the genre are special in their capacity to create an accessible social critique from the position of the marginalised. Noir, that is, addresses as essential aspects of its style social issues such as power, cultural determinism and, the noir mainstay mentioned above-marginalisation. And\n\nAlphaville Journal of Film and Screen Media, 2020\n\nMy project (Horizon 2020, 2018-20) traces Black female moviegoing in Harlem during the silent film era. The main challenge in uncovering the women's stories is that historical paradigm has always prioritised the voices of the white, middle-class elite. In the field of Black film history, criticism expressed by male journalists-such as Lester A. Walton of New York Age-has understandably received the most attention (Everett; Field, Uplift). Black, working-class women are notoriously missing from the archive. How do we navigate historical records, with their own limits and absences? This paper argues for a broader engagement with historic artefacts-memoirs, correspondence and recollections-as necessary to re-centre film historiography towards the marginalised. It points to the ways in which we can learn from the scholars and methods of African American history to \"fill in the gaps\" in the study of historical spectatorship.\n\nfrom a special issue on film criticism\n\nCinema Journal, 2014\n\nSigns: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, 2004\n\nA review of Gillespie's new book, published by Duke University Press, and an interview with the author on the state of the field, and his next projects.\n\nFilm &amp; History: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 2016\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLoading Preview\n\nSorry, preview is currently unavailable.
