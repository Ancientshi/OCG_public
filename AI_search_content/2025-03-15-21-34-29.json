While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998) , on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.Nolan's second film was Memento (2000) , which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan . Starring Guy Pearce , the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia (2002) , starring Al Pacino , Robin Williams and Hilary Swank .The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005) , Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006) , starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008) .

Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations. The film is widely considered one of the best comic book adaptations of all times, with Heath Ledger 's performance as the Joker receiving an extremely high acclaim. Ledger posthumously became the first Academy Award winning performance in a Nolan film.In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the Sci-Fi thriller Inception (2010) , starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay that he worked on for almost a decade. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year, and of all times. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with a W.G.A. Award accolade, as well as D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards nominations for his work on the film.As one of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy.

In 2020 he released his mind-bending Sci-Fi espionage thriller Tenet (2020) starring John David Washington in the lead role. Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie grossed relatively less than Nolan's previous blockbusters, though it did do good numbers compared to other movies in that period of time. Hailed as Nolan's most complex film yet, the film was one of Nolan's less-acclaimed films at the time, yet slowly built a fan-base following in later years.In July 2023, Nolan released his highly acclaimed biographic drama Oppenheimer (2023) starring Nolan's frequent collaborator Cillian Murphy - in the lead role for the first time in a Nolan film. The movie was a cultural phenomenon that on top of grossing almost 1 billion dollars at the Worldwide Box office, also swept the 2023/2024 award-season and gave Nolan his first Oscars, BAFTAs, Golden Globes, D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards, as well as a handful of regional critics-circles awards and a W.G.A. nomination. Cillian's performance as quantum physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was highly acclaimed as well, and became the first lead performance in a Nolan film to win the Academy Award.During 2023, Nolan also received a fellowship from the British Film Institute (BFI).

The final film was initially judgedto be almost unreleasable weird, but thanks to the efforts ofdistributor Ben Barenholtz , it secured acult following and enabled Lynch to make his first mainstream film (inan unlikely alliance withMel Brooks ), thoughThe Elephant Man (1980) was shotthrough with his unique sensibility. Its enormous critical andcommercial success led to Dune (1984) , ahugely expensive commercial disaster, but Lynch redeemed himself withthe now classic Blue Velvet (1986) ,his most personal and original work since his debut.

Roman Polanski Chinatown (1974) Roman Polanski is a Polish film director, producer, writer and actor.Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA, he isconsidered one of the few truly international filmmakers.Roman Polanski was born in Paris in 1933.His parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began.On Germany's invasion in 1939, as a family of mostly Jewish heritage, they were allsent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent totwo different concentration camps:His father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria, where he survived the war, and his mother to Auschwitz whereshe was murdered. Roman witnessed his father's capture and then, at only 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war, at firstwandering through the Polish countryside and pretending to be a Roman-Catholic kid visiting his relatives.Although this saved his life, he was severely mistreated suffering nearly fatal beating whichleft him with a fractured skull.Local people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed littleconcerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed, Poland became increasingly war-torn and he lived his life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find.Still under 12 years old, he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war'send in 1945, he reunited with his father who sent him to a technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen anothercareer.In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda 's Pokolenie (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School.His early shorts such as Dwaj ludzie z szafa (1958) , Le gros et le maigre (1961) and Ssaki (1962) , showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships.His feature debut, Knife in the Water (1962) , was one of the first Polish post-war films not associated with the war theme.It was also the first movie from Poland to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film.Though already a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France.While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, Gérard Brach , who eventually became his long-time collaborator.The next two films, Repulsion (1965) and Cul-de-sac (1966) , made in England and co-written by Brach, won respectively Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin International Film Festival.In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, Rosemary's Baby (1968) . However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate , by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Chinatown (1974) .It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the sodomy of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from he USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979) , which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films.It wasn't until The Pianist (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. For that movie, he won nearly all the most important film awards, including the Oscar for Best Director, Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, the BAFTA and Cesar Award.He still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results, as in Una pura formalità (1994) .

Brian De Palma Body Double (1984) Brian De Palma is one of the well-known directors who spear-headed the new movement in Hollywood during the 1970s. He is known for his many films that go from violent pictures, to Hitchcock-like thrillers. Born on September 11, 1940, De Palma was born in Newark, New Jersey in an Italian-American family. Originally entering university as a physics student, De Palma became attracted to films after seeing such classics as Citizen Kane (1941) . Enrolling in Sarah Lawrence College, he found lasting influences from such varied teachers as Alfred Hitchcock and Andy Warhol .At first, his films comprised of such black-and-white films as To Bridge This Gap (1969) . He then discovered a young actor whose fame would influence Hollywood forever. In 1968, De Palma made the comedic film Greetings (1968) starring Robert De Niro in his first ever credited film role. The two followed up immediately with the films The Wedding Party (1969) and Hi, Mom! (1970) .After making such small-budget thrillers such as Sisters (1972) and Obsession (1976) , De Palma was offered the chance to direct a film based on Stephen King 's classic novel \"Carrie\". The story deals with a tormented teenage girl who finds she has the power of telekinesis. The film starred Sissy Spacek , Piper Laurie and John Travolta , and was for De Palma, a chance to try out the split screen technique for which he would later become famous.Carrie (1976) was a massive success, and earned the two lead females (Laurie and Spacek) Oscar nominations. The film was praised by most critics, and De Palma's reputation was now permanently secured. He followed up this success with the horror film The Fury (1978) , the comedic film Home Movies (1979) (both these films featured Kirk Douglas ), the crime thriller Dressed to Kill (1980) starring Michael Caine and Angie Dickinson , and another crime thriller entitled Blow Out (1981) starring John Travolta .His next major success was the controversial, ultra-violent film Scarface (1983) . Written by Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino , the film concerned Cuban immigrant Tony Montana's rise to power in the United States through the drug trade. While being a critical failure, the film was a major success commercially.Moving on from Scarface (1983) , De Palma made two more movies before landing another one of his now-classics: The Untouchables (1987) , starring old friend Robert De Niro in the role of Chicago gangster Al Capone. Also starring in the film were Kevin Costner as the man who commits himself to bring Capone down, and Sean Connery , an old policeman who helps Costner's character to form a group known as the Untouchables. The film was one of De Palma's most successful films, earning Connery an Oscar, and gave Ennio Morricone a nomination for Best Score.After The Untouchables (1987) , De Palma made the Vietnam film Casualties of War (1989) starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn . The film focuses on a new soldier who is helpless to stop his dominating sergeant from kidnapping a Vietnamese girl with the help of the coerced members of the platoon. The film did reasonably well at the box office, but it was his next film that truly displayed the way he could make a hit and a disaster within a short time. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) starred a number of well-known actors such as Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman , however it was still a commercial flop and earned him two Razzie nominations.But the roller coaster success that De Palma had gotten so far did not let him down. He made the horror film Raising Cain (1992) , and the criminal drama Carlito's Way (1993) starring Al Pacino and Sean Penn . The latter film is about a former criminal just released from prison that is trying to avoid his past and move on. It was in the year 1996 that brought one of his most well-known movies. This was the suspense-filled Mission: Impossible (1996) starring Tom Cruise and Jon Voight .Following up this film was the interesting but unsuccessful film Snake Eyes (1998) starring Nicolas Cage as a detective who finds himself in the middle of a murder scene at a boxing ring. De Palma continued on with the visually astounding but equally unsuccessful film Mission to Mars (2000) which earned him another Razzie nomination. He met failure again with the crime thriller Femme Fatale (2002) , the murder conspiracy The Black Dahlia (2006) , and the controversial film Redacted (2007) which deals with individual stories from the war in Iraq.Brian De Palma may be down for the moment, but if his box office history has taught us anything, it is that he always returns with amajor success that is remembered for years and years afterwards.

Sidney Lumet 12 Angry Men (1957) Sidney Lumet was a master of cinema, best known for his technicalknowledge and his skill at getting first-rate performances from hisactors -- and for shooting most of his films in his beloved New York.He made over 40 movies, often complex and emotional, but seldom overlysentimental. Although his politics were somewhat left-leaning and heoften treated socially relevant themes in his films, Lumet didn't wantto make political movies in the first place. Born on June 25, 1924, inPhiladelphia, the son of actor Baruch Lumet and dancer Eugenia Wermus Lumet, he made his stage debut at age four atthe Yiddish Art Theater in New York. He played many roles on Broadwayin the 1930s and also in the film...One Third of a Nation... (1939) .After starting an off-Broadway acting troupe in the late 1940s, hebecame the director of many television shows in the 1950s. Lumet madehis feature film directing debut with12 Angry Men (1957) , which won theGolden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and earned three Academy Awardnominations. The courtroom drama, which takes place almost entirely ina jury room, is justly regarded as one of the most auspiciousdirectorial debuts in film history. Lumet got the chance to directMarlon Brando inThe Fugitive Kind (1960) , animperfect, but powerful adaptation ofTennessee Williams ' \"OrpheusDescending\". The first half of the 1960s was one of Lumet's mostartistically successful periods.Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962) ,a masterful, brilliantly photographed adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play, is one of several Lumet films about families. It earnedKatharine Hepburn ,Ralph Richardson ,Dean Stockwell andJason Robards deserved acting awards inCannes and Hepburn an Oscar nomination. The alarming Cold War thrillerFail Safe (1964) unfairly suffered fromcomparison to Stanley Kubrick 'sequally great satireDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) ,which was released shortly before.The Pawnbroker (1964) , arguablythe most outstanding of the great movies Lumet made in this phase,tells the story of a Holocaust survivor who lives in New York and can'tovercome his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps.Rod Steiger 's unforgettable performance inthe title role earned an Academy Award nomination. Lumet's intensecharacter study The Hill (1965) aboutinhumanity in a military prison camp was the first of five films he didwith Sean Connery . After the overly talkybut rewarding drama The Group (1966) about young upper-class women in the 1930s, and the stylish spythrillerThe Deadly Affair (1967) , thelate 1960s turned out to be a lesser phase in Lumet's career. He had astrong comeback with the box-office hitThe Anderson Tapes (1971) .The Offence (1973) was commerciallyless successful, but artistically brilliant - with Connery in one ofhis most impressive performances. The terrific cop thrillerSerpico (1973) , the first of his filmsabout police corruption in New York City, became one of his biggestcritical and financial successes. Al Pacino 'sfascinating portrayal of the real-life cop Frank Serpico earned aGolden Globe and the movie earned two Academy Award nominations (it isworth noting that Lumet's feature films of the 1970s alone earned 30Oscar nominations, winning six times). The love triangleLovin' Molly (1974) was not alwaysconvincing in its atmospheric details, but Lumet's fine sense ofemotional truth and a good Blythe Danner keep it interesting. The adaptation ofAgatha Christie 'sMurder on the Orient Express (1974) ,an exquisitely photographed murder mystery with an all-star cast, was abig success again. Lumet's complex crime thrillerDog Day Afternoon (1975) , whichPauline Kael called \"one of the best \"NewYork\" movies ever made\", gave Al Pacino theopportunity for a breathtaking, three-dimensional portrayal of abisexual man who tries to rob a bank to finance his lover's sex-changeoperation. Lumet's next masterpiece,Network (1976) , was a prophetic satire onmedia and society. The film version ofPeter Shaffer 's stage playEquus (1977) about a doctor and hismentally confused patient was also powerful, not least because of theenergetic acting byRichard Burton andPeter Firth . After the enjoyablemusical The Wiz (1978) and theinteresting but not easily accessible comedyJust Tell Me What You Want (1980) ,Sidney Lumet won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for hisoutstanding direction ofPrince of the City (1981) , oneof his best and most typical films. It's about police corruption, buthardly a remake of Serpico (1973) .Starring a powerful Treat Williams , it'san extraordinarily multi-layered film. In his highly informative book\"Making Movies\" (1995), Lumet describes the film in the following way:\"When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us.Nothing is what it seems.\" It's also a movie about values, friendshipand drug addiction and, like \"Serpico\", is based on a true story. InDeathtrap (1982) , Lumet successfullyblended suspense and black humor.The Verdict (1982) was voted thefourth greatest courtroom drama of all time by the American FilmInstitute in 2008. A few minor inaccuracies in legal details do not marthis study of an alcoholic lawyer (superbly embodied byPaul Newman ) aiming to regain hisself-respect through a malpractice case. The expertly directed moviereceived five Academy Award nominations. Lumet's controversial dramaDaniel (1983) withTimothy Hutton , an adaptation ofE.L. Doctorow 's \"The Book of Daniel\" abouttwo young people whose parents were executed during the McCarthy RedScare hysteria in the 1950s for alleged espionage, is one of hisunderrated achievements. His later masterpieceRunning on Empty (1988) has asimilar theme, portraying a family which has been on the run from theFBI since the parents (played byChristine Lahti andJudd Hirsch ) committed a bomb attack on anapalm laboratory in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam. The son(played by River Phoenix in anextraordinarily moving, Oscar-nominated performance) falls in love witha girl and wishes to stay with her and study music.Naomi Foner 's screenplay won the GoldenGlobe. Other Lumet movies of the 1980s are the melancholic comedy dramaGarbo Talks (1984) ; the occasionallyclichéd Power (1986) about electioncampaigns; the all too slow thrillerThe Morning After (1986) andthe amusing gangster comedyFamily Business (1989) . WithQ &amp;amp; A (1990) Lumet returned to the genre ofthe New York cop thriller. Nick Nolte shinesin the role of a corrupt and racist detective in this multi-layered,strangely underrated film. Sadly, with the exception ofNight Falls on Manhattan (1996) ,an imperfect but fascinating crime drama in the tradition of his ownprevious genre works, almost none of Lumet's works of the 1990s didquite get the attention they deserved. The crime dramaClose to Eden (1992) blended genres in a way that did not seem to match most viewers'expectations, but its contemplations about life arouse interest. Theintelligent hospital satireCritical Care (1997) was unfairlyneglected as well. The courtroom thrillerGuilty as Sin (1993) was cold butintriguing. Lumet's Gloria (1999) remakeseemed unnecessary, but he returned impressively with theunderestimated courtroom comedyFind Me Guilty (2006) and thejustly acclaimed crime thrillerBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007) .In 2005, Sidney Lumet received a well-deserved honorary Academy Awardfor his outstanding contribution to filmmaking. Sidney Lumet tragicallydied of cancer in 2011. Twisty Thriller Highlights : Deathtrap, Murder On The Orient Express, Before The Devil Knows Your Dead\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n- ## 9.

The terrific cop thriller\n, the first of his films\nabout police corruption in New York City, became one of his biggest\ncritical and financial successes. 's\nfascinating portrayal of the real-life cop Frank Serpico earned a\nGolden Globe and the movie earned two Academy Award nominations (it is\nworth noting that Lumet's feature films of the 1970s alone earned 30\nOscar nominations, winning six times). The love triangle\n was not always\nconvincing in its atmospheric details, but Lumet's fine sense of\nemotional truth and a good \nkeep it interesting. The adaptation of\n's\n,\nan exquisitely photographed murder mystery with an all-star cast, was a\nbig success again. Lumet's complex crime thriller\n, which\n called \"one of the best \"New\nYork\" movies ever made\", gave  the\nopportunity for a breathtaking, three-dimensional portrayal of a\nbisexual man who tries to rob a bank to finance his lover's sex-change\noperation. Lumet's next masterpiece,\n, was a prophetic satire on\nmedia and society. The film version of\n's stage play\n about a doctor and his\nmentally confused patient was also powerful, not least because of the\nenergetic acting by\n and\n. After the enjoyable\nmusical  and the\ninteresting but not easily accessible comedy\n,\nSidney Lumet won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for his\noutstanding direction of\n, one\nof his best and most typical films. It's about police corruption, but\nhardly a remake of .\nStarring a powerful , it's\nan extraordinarily multi-layered film. In his highly informative book\n\"Making Movies\" (1995), Lumet describes the film in the following way:\n\"When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us.\nNothing is what it seems.\" It's also a movie about values, friendship\nand drug addiction and, like \"Serpico\", is based on a true story. In\n, Lumet successfully\nblended suspense and black humor.\n was voted the\nfourth greatest courtroom drama of all time by the American Film\nInstitute in 2008. A few minor inaccuracies in legal details do not mar\nthis study of an alcoholic lawyer (superbly embodied by\n) aiming to regain his\nself-respect through a malpractice case. The expertly directed movie\nreceived five Academy Award nominations. Lumet's controversial drama\n with\n, an adaptation of\n's \"The Book of Daniel\" about\ntwo young people whose parents were executed during the McCarthy Red\nScare hysteria in the 1950s for alleged espionage, is one of his\nunderrated achievements. His later masterpiece\n has a\nsimilar theme, portraying a family which has been on the run from the\nFBI since the parents (played by\n and\n) committed a bomb attack on a\nnapalm laboratory in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam. The son\n(played by  in an\nextraordinarily moving, Oscar-nominated performance) falls in love with\na girl and wishes to stay with her and study music.\n's screenplay won the Golden\nGlobe. Other Lumet movies of the 1980s are the melancholic comedy drama\n; the occasionally\nclichéd  about election\ncampaigns; the all too slow thriller\n and\nthe amusing gangster comedy\n. With\n Lumet returned to the genre of\nthe New York cop thriller.  shines\nin the role of a corrupt and racist detective in this multi-layered,\nstrangely underrated film. Sadly, with the exception of\n,\nan imperfect but fascinating crime drama in the tradition of his own\nprevious genre works, almost none of Lumet's works of the 1990s did\nquite get the attention they deserved. The crime drama\n\nblended genres in a way that did not seem to match most viewers'\nexpectations, but its contemplations about life arouse interest. The\nintelligent hospital satire\n was unfairly\nneglected as well. The courtroom thriller\n was cold but\nintriguing. Lumet's  remake\nseemed unnecessary, but he returned impressively with the\nunderestimated courtroom comedy\n and the\njustly acclaimed crime thriller\n.\nIn 2005, Sidney Lumet received a well-deserved honorary Academy Award\nfor his outstanding contribution to filmmaking. Sidney Lumet tragically\ndied of cancer in 2011.\n- : Deathtrap, Murder On The Orient Express, Before The Devil Knows Your Dead\n- 10.

John Huston The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) An eccentric rebel of epic proportions, this Hollywood titan reignedsupreme as director, screenwriter and character actor in a career thatendured over five decades. The ten-time Oscar-nominated legend was bornJohn Marcellus Huston in Nevada, Missouri, on August 5, 1906. Hisancestry was English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, distant German and very remote Portuguese. The age-old storygoes that the small town of his birth was won by John's grandfather ina poker game. John's father was the equally magnanimous character actorWalter Huston , and his mother, Rhea Gore,was a newspaperwoman who traveled around the country looking forstories. The only child of the couple, John began performing on stagewith his vaudevillian father at age 3. Upon his parents' divorce at age7, the young boy would take turns traveling around the vaudevillecircuit with his father and the country with his mother on reportingexcursions. A frail and sickly child, he was once placed in asanitarium due to both an enlarged heart and kidney ailment. Making amiraculous recovery, he quit school at age 14 to become a full-fledgedboxer and eventually won the Amateur Lightweight Boxing Championship ofCalifornia, winning 22 of 25 bouts. His trademark broken nose was theresult of that robust activity.John married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Harvey, and also tookhis first professional stage bow with a leading role off-Broadwayentitled \"The Triumph of the Egg.\" He made his Broadway debut that sameyear with \"Ruint\" on April 7, 1925, and followed that with anotherBroadway show \"Adam Solitaire\" the following November. John soon grewrestless with the confines of both his marriage and acting andabandoned both, taking a sojourn to Mexico where he became an officerin the cavalry and expert horseman while writing plays on the sly.Trying to control his wanderlust urges, he subsequently returned toAmerica and attempted newspaper and magazine reporting work in New Yorkby submitting short stories. He was even hired at one point by mogulSamuel Goldwyn Jr. as a screenwriter,but again he grew restless. During this time he also appeared unbilledin a few obligatory films. By 1932 John was on the move again and leftfor London and Paris where he studied painting and sketching. Thepromising artist became a homeless beggar during one harrowing point.Returning again to America in 1933, he played the title role in aproduction of \"Abraham Lincoln,\" only a few years after father Walterportrayed the part on film forD.W. Griffith . John made a newresolve to hone in on his obvious writing skills and begancollaborating on a few scripts for Warner Brothers. He also marriedagain. Warners was so impressed with his talents that he was signed onas both screenwriter and director for theDashiell Hammett mystery yarnThe Maltese Falcon (1941) . Themovie classic made a superstar out ofHumphrey Bogart and is considered bycritics and audiences alike--- 65 years after the fact--- to be thegreatest detective film ever made. In the meantime John wrote/staged acouple of Broadway plays, and in the aftermath of his mammoth screensuccess directed bad-girl'Bette Davis (I)' and good girlOlivia de Havilland in the film melodramaIn This Our Life (1942) , andthree of his \"Falcon\" stars (Bogart,Mary Astor andSydney Greenstreet ) in the romanticwar pictureAcross the Pacific (1942) .During WWII John served as a Signal Corps lieutenant and went on tohelm a number of film documentaries for the U.S. government includingthe controversialLet There Be Light (1980) ,which father Walter narrated. The end of WWII also saw the end of hissecond marriage. He married third wifeEvelyn Keyes , of \"Gone With the Wind\" fame,in 1946 but it too lasted a relatively short time. That same year theimpulsive and always unpredictable Huston directedJean-Paul Sartre 's experimental play\"No Exit\" on Broadway. The show was a box-office bust (running lessthan a month) but nevertheless earned the New York Drama Critics Awardas \"best foreign play.\"Hollywood glory came to him again in association with Bogart and WarnerBrothers'.The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) ,a classic tale of gold, greed and man's inhumanity to man set inMexico, won John Oscars for both director and screenplay and his fathernabbed the \"Best Supporting Actor\" trophy. John can be glimpsed at thebeginning of the movie in a cameo playing a tourist, but he wouldn'tact again on film for a decade and a half. With the momentum in hisfavor, John hung around in Hollywood this time to write and/or directsome of the finest American cinema made includingKey Largo (1948) andThe African Queen (1951) (bothwith Bogart),The Asphalt Jungle (1950) ,The Red Badge of Courage (1951) and Moulin Rouge (1952) . Laterfilms, including Moby Dick (1956) ,The Unforgiven (1960) ,The Misfits (1961) ,Freud (1962) ,The Night of the Iguana (1964) andThe Bible: In the Beginning... (1966) were, for the most part, well-regarded but certainly not close to thelevel of his earlier revered work. He also experimentedbehind-the-camera with color effects and approached topics that mostothers would not even broach, including homosexuality andpsychoanalysis.An ardent supporter of human rights, he, along with directorWilliam Wyler and others, dared to formthe Committee for the First Amendment in 1947, which strove toundermine the House Un-American Activities Committee. Disgusted by theHollywood blacklisting that was killing the careers of many talentedfolk, he moved to St. Clerans in Ireland and became a citizen therealong with his fourth wife, ballet dancer Enrica (Ricki) Soma. Thecouple had two children, including daughterAnjelica Huston who went on to have anenviable Hollywood career of her own. Huston and wife Ricki split aftera son (director Danny Huston ) was born toanother actress in 1962. They did not divorce, however, and remainedestranged until her sudden death in 1969 in a car accident. Johnsubsequently adopted his late wife's child from another union. Theever-impulsive Huston would move yet again to Mexico where he married(1972) and divorced (1977) his fifth and final wife, Celeste Shane.Huston returned to acting auspiciously with a major role inOtto Preminger 's epic filmThe Cardinal (1963) for which Hustonreceived an Oscar nomination at age 57. From that time forward, hewould be glimpsed here and there in a number of colorful, baggy-eyedcharacter roles in both good and bad (some positively abysmal) filmsthat, at the very least, helped finance his passion projects. Theformer list included outstanding roles inChinatown (1974) andThe Wind and the Lion (1975) ,while the latter comprised of hammy parts in such awful drek asCandy (1968) andMyra Breckinridge (1970) .Directing daughter Angelica in her inauspicious movie debut, thethoroughly mediocreA Walk with Love and Death (1969) ,John made up for it 15 years later by directing her to Oscar glory inthe mob talePrizzi's Honor (1985) . In the1970s Huston resurged as a director of quality films withFat City (1972) ,The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and Wise Blood (1979) . He ended hiscareer on a high note withUnder the Volcano (1984) , theafore-mentionedPrizzi's Honor (1985) andThe Dead (1987) . His only certifiablemisfire during that era was the elephantine musical version ofAnnie (1982) , though it later becamesomewhat of a cult favorite among children.Huston lived the macho, outdoors life, unencumbered by convention orrestrictions, and is often compared in style or flamboyancy to anErnest Hemingway orOrson Welles .

Fritz Lang Contempt (1963) Fritz Lang was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1890. His father managed aconstruction company. His mother, Pauline Schlesinger, was Jewish butconverted to Catholicism when Lang was ten. After high school, heenrolled briefly at the Technische Hochschule Wien and then started totrain as a painter. From 1910 to 1914, he traveled in Europe, and hewould later claim, also in Asia and North Africa. He studied paintingin Paris from 1913-14. At the start of World War I, he returned toVienna, enlisting in the army in January 1915. Severely wounded in June1916, he wrote some scenarios for films while convalescing. In early1918, he was sent home shell-shocked and acted briefly in Viennesetheater before accepting a job as a writer atErich Pommer 's production company inBerlin, Decla. In Berlin, Lang worked briefly as a writer and then as adirector, at Ufa and then for Nero-Film, owned by the AmericanSeymour Nebenzal . In 1920, he began arelationship with actress and writerThea von Harbou (1889-1954), who wrotewith him the scripts for his most celebrated films:Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler (1922) ,Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924) ,Metropolis (1927) andM (1931) (credited to von Harbou alone). Theymarried in 1922 and divorced in 1933. In that year, Nazi propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels offered Lang thejob of head of the German Cinema Institute. Lang--who was an anti-Nazimainly because of his Catholic background--did not accept the position(it was later offered to and accepted by filmmakerLeni Riefenstahl ) and, after secretlysending most of his money out of the country, fled Germany to Paris.After about a year in Paris, Lang moved to the United States inmid-1934, initially under contract to MGM. Over the next 20 years, hedirected numerous American films. In the 1950s, in part because thefilm industry was in economic decline and also because of Lang'slong-standing reputation for being difficult with, and abusive to,actors, he found it increasingly hard to get work. At the end of the1950s, he traveled to Germany and made what turned out to be his finalthree films there, none of which were well received.In 1964, nearly blind, he was chosen to be president of the jury at theCannes Film Festival. He was an avid collector of primitive art andhabitually wore a monocle, an affectation he picked up during his earlydays in Vienna. After his divorce from von Harbou, he had relationshipswith many other women, but from about 1931 to his death in 1976, he wasclose to Lily Latte , who helped him in manyways.

Robert Siodmak Nachts wenn der Teufel kam (1957) Robert Siodmak (8 August 1900 - 10 March 1973) was a German-born, American film director. He is best remembered as a thriller specialist and for a series of stylish, unpretentious Hollywood films noirs he made in the 1940s.Siodmak (pronounced SEE-ODD-MACK) was born in Dresden, Germany, the son of Rosa Philippine (née Blum) and Ignatz Siodmak. His parents were both from Jewish families in Leipzig (the myth of his American birth in Memphis, Tennessee was necessary for him to obtain a visa in Paris during World War II). He worked as a stage director and a banker before becoming editor and scenarist for Curtis Bernhardt in 1925 (Bernhardt would direct a film of Siodmak's story \"Conflict\" in 1945). At twenty-six he was hired by his cousin, producer Seymour Nebenzal, to assemble original silent movies from stock footage of old films. Siodmak worked at this for two years before he persuaded Nebenzal to finance his first feature, the silent chef d'oeuvre, \"Menschen am Sonntag\" (\"People on Sunday\") in1929. The script was co-written by Billy Wilder and Siodmak's brother Curt Siodmak, later the screenwriter of \"The Wolf Man\" (1941). It was the last German silent and also included such future Hollywood artists as Fred Zinnemann, Edgar G. Ulmer, and Eugen Schufftan. His next film--the first at UFA to use sound--was the 1930 comedy \"Abschied\" for writers Emeric Pressburger and Irma von Cube, followed by \"Der Mann, der seinen Mörder sucht,\" another comedy, yet quite different and unusual, a likely product of Billy Wilder's imagination (remade a noir, \"DOA,\" in 1950). But in his next film, the crime thriller \"Stürme der Leidenschaft,\" with Emil Jannings and Anna Sten, Siodmak found a style that would become his own.With the rise of Nazism and following an attack in the press by Hitler's minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels in 1933 after viewing \"Brennendes Geheimnis\" (\"The Burning Secret\"), Siodmak left Germany for Paris. His creativity flourished, as he worked for the next six years in a variety of film genres, from comedy (\"Le sexe fable\" and \"La Vie Parisienne\" ) to musical (\"La crise est finie,\" with Danielle Darrieux) to drama (\"Mister Flow,\" \"Cargaison blanche,\" \"Mollenard\"--compare Gabrielle Dorziat's shrewish wife with that of Rosalind Ivan's in \"The Suspect\"--and the superb \"Pièges,\" with Maurice Chevalier and Erich Von Stroheim). While in France, he was well on his way to becoming successor to Rene Clair, until Hitler again forced him out. Siodmak arrived in Hollywood in 1939, where he made 23 movies, many of them widely popular thrillers and crime melodramas, which critics today regard as classics of film noir.Beginning in 1941, he first turned out several B-films and programmers for various studios before he gained a seven-year contract with Universal Studios in 1943. The best of those early films are the thriller \"Fly by Night\" in 1942, with Richard Carlson and Nancy Kelly, and in 1943 the touching weepie \"Someone to Remember,\" with Mable Paige in a signature role. As house director, his services were often used to salvage troublesome productions at the studio. On Mark Hellinger's production \"Swell Guy\" (1946), for instance, Siodmak was brought in to replace Frank Tuttle only six days after completing work on \"The Killers.\" Siodmak worked steadily while under contract, overshadowed by high profile directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, with whom he had been often compared by the press.At Universal, Siodmak made yet another B-film, \"Son of Dracula\"(1943), the third and best in a trilogy of Dracula movies (based on his brother Curt's original story). His second feature, and first A-film, was the Maria Montez/Jon Hall vehicle, \"Cobra Woman\" (1944), made in garish Technicolor (Montez's cobra dance alone is worth the price of admission).His first all-out noir was \"Phantom Lady\" (1944), for staff producer Joan Harrison, Universal's first female executive and Alfred Hitchcock's former secretary and script assistant. A classic, however flawed, it showcased Siodmak's skill with camera and editing to dazzling effect, but no more so than in the iconic jam-session sequence with Elisha Cook Jr. in throes on the drums. Following the critical success of \"Phantom Lady,\" Siodmak directed \"Christmas Holiday\" (1944) with Deanna Durbin and Gene Kelly (Hans J. Salter received an Oscar nomination for best music). Beginning with this film, his work in Hollywood attained the stylistic and thematic characteristics that are evident in his later noirs. \"Christmas Holiday,\" adapted from a W. Somerset Maugham novel by Herman J. Mankiewicz, was Durbin's most successful feature, which she considered her only good film (and that Mankiewicz said was among his work in the 40s of which he was most proud). Siodmak's use of black-and-white cinematography and urban landscapes, together with his light-and-shadow designs, formed the basic structure of class",

In fact, sometimes the best films—or aspects of films—come from looking inward for sources of turmoil that can feel more real and be more relatable for viewers than any gunfight or car chase.  We're talking about stories that explore mental illness, and what kind of impact varying illness can have on lives, relationships, and more. And while mental illness still holds far too significant of a stigma in modern society, that stigma is decreasing; mainstream depiction in films seen and loved by many can be a major factor in continuing to break down that wall.\n\nMovies either centering on or touching upon mental illness aren't a new concept, but the range of genres doing so is wider than ever before. From romantic comedies to action blockbusters, a discussion on mental illness—and mental health—can be found almost anywhere. In fact, a movie doesn't even need to be about mental illness or mental health to be part of the ongoing surrounding conversation. That could be a good way to normalize the conversation, and some of the movies on out list below do a great job of doing so.\n\nThe list below is in no way expansive, but it does cover a lot of ground. Some movies are great, some are merely good, but all do a great job of facilitating the conversation that it's important for all of us to be having.\n\n## Silver Linings Playbook (2012)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on Matthew Quick's novel of the same name, Silver Linings Playbook follows its two main characters closely. Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan and diagnosed bipolar who's recently been released from a stint in a mental hospital, and Jennifer Lawrence (in her Oscar-winning role) plays a widow dealing with her own mental illness in the aftermath of her husband's death. Despite those seemingly-heavy themes, the movie is actually a fantastic romantic comedy, showing the ways two people with their own sets of problems can find greatness in one another, even when they aren't looking for it. Bonus greatness comes in the form of performances from Robert DeNiro, Jackie Weaver, Chris Tucker, and a really great soundtrack.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerhaps the most famous movie ever made about mental illness is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the classic from Milos Foreman. The movie, rightly considered a classic, finds a criminal who pleaded insanity (Jack Nicholson) in a mental asylum, helping to lead his fellow patients in an uprising against the abusive nurse (Louise Fletcher) who takes advantage of them.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Trainspotting (1996)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAddiction is without question a mental illness, and no movie shows it for the high highs and low lows better than director Danny Boyle's stylish breakout hit Trainspotting. The film, led by Ewan McGregor's Renton, follows a group of heroin0-addicted friends in '90s Scotland, and it's fun one minute, with one of the best soundtracks around, and absolutely horrifying the next. Trainspotting is a staple of modern cinema, and for good reason.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Aftersun (2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerhaps the best depiction of living through manic depression in recent years is Aftersun, the debut film from director Charlotte Wells. Following a young father (Paul Mescal) and his daughter (Frankie Corio) on a vacation, the movie dives deep into these two specific characters, and the impact this trip holds even years later. Mescal has been one of the industry's shining stars, but his performance in Aftersun—which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor—is the highlight of his career thus far.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Take Shelter (2011)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTake Shelter, starring Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain and coming from director Jeff Nichols, is a psychological thriller in every sense of the word. The film depicts the paranoia that comes along with schizophrenia—the illness runs in Shannon's character's family, and  viewers are forced to share his same fears: is this really happening, or is it just happening to me? This film features one of Shannon's best performances, and the uncertainty that comes along with its storyline is something that all of those diagnosed with a mental illness like schizophrenia can likely relate to.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Birth (2004)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirector Jonathan Glazer has only made four films, all of which are made specifically when he's got something to say or something, specifically, he wants to explore. Birth, which came out in 2004, is an interesting and at times distressing look at grief. Nicole Kidman plays a woman who's husband suddenly died during a run in the park, only for a boy to show up years later claiming to be her late husband reincarnated. Much of this wasn't considered anything more than typical grief or PTSD, but Prolonged Grief Disorder became a diagnosable mental illness in DSM-5, and the symptoms are significantly at play in this engaging and interesting film.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Girl, Interrupted (1999)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJames Mangold (Logan, Walk the Line) directed Girl, Interrupted which follows a young woman (Winona Ryder) who finds herself institutionalized following a suicide attempt. Inside the institution (called Claymoore) she meets another young woman (Angelina Jolie), and the film explores how these characters grow throughout the course of her 18-month stay.\n\nGirl, Interrupted is set in the late '60s, and makes for an interested modern day watch because not only do you get to see how the perception of mental illness and health changed between the '60s and 1999 (when the film was released), but also the differences between 1999 and now. Based on Susanna Kaysen's book of the same name.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## The King of Staten Island (2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe newest movie on this list, The King of Staten Island follows a recent pattern of movies directed by Judd Apatow, in which he allows his lead actor to co-write the movie in order to tell (some version of) their own story. The King of Staten Island, then, follows many of the same beats as star Pete Davidson's life. He plays a kid from, yes, Staten Island, who's lost his father at a young age, and has grown up his entire life with depression and a diagnosis with bipolar disorder.\n\nThe movie shows the beats of Davidson's character's life, and also shows how his own life intersects with those around him, including his mother (Marissa Tomei), sister (Maude Apatow), friends, and mother's boyfriend (Bill Burr). The movie is funny in many of the ways you'd expect from Apatow and Davidson, but even more manages to tell a great story with a really big heart.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Black Swan (2010)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce you know that Black Swan was directed by Darren Aronofsky—a master at following someone slowly losing their grip on sanity—everything else makes perfect sense. Natalie Portman won an Oscar for her role as a dancer who lands a heavily-coveted role in a ballet production, and has trouble dealing with the internal and external pressure that comes after.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Lars and the Real Girl (2007)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRyan Gosling might give his best performance in Lars and the Real Girl, where he plays the titular shy, introverted main character, who finally finds the \"real girl\" of his dreams...who just happens to be a doll he found on the internet. The movie takes place in a small town where everyone knows one another, so rather than making fun of him, the town mostly plays along, allowing Gosling's character—and all of the years of trauma that resulted in this delusion—to run its course.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Fight Club (1999)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf Lars and the Real Girl is mostly a nice movie, well, David Fincher's Fight Club is...uh, not. Fight Club is aggressive and in your face about what it means, with not-so-subtle points all along the way about toxic masculinity, suppressed pain and trauma, and way more. If you somehow haven't seen Fight Club and haven't had it spoiled, you're in for a big treat—Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both mesmerizing, and Fincher does as Fincher does. The movie is stunning from start to finish.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## A Beautiful Mind (2001)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Beautiful Mind is a fairly straightforward entry on this list, telling the true-life tale of paranoid schizophrenic mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe), who takes on additional work and begins to believe that he's involved in a massive conspiracy. Anyone who's been watching MCU movies or WandaVision will also be pleased to find a relatively early Paul Bettany performance here as well. \n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Little Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine doesn't entirely revolve around mental health or mental illness, but it plays a huge role in the movie. The inciting incident of the film is a family road trip in a yellow VW bus taking young Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in a pageant. But just before the events of the film, Frank (Steve Carell) has just attempted suicide, and Duane (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence. The movie shows how different people handle different forms of trauma, and does so in a total package that's both respectful and entertaining.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## It's Kind Of a Funny Story (2010)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt's Kind of a Funny Story, based on the novel of the same name, is about a 16-year-old kid who spends time in the psychiatric hospital after contemplating suicide. The movie, which features Keir Gilchrist in the lead, along with Emma Roberts, Viola Davis, and Zach Galifianakis, is not as grim as it may sound. In fact, it's fairly light in tone, showing that the people who need help are just that: people who need help, people who make jokes, and people who can help others, too.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## The Skeleton Twins (2014)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Skeleton Twins pairs two beloved Saturday Night Live alums—Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig—together as estranged twins brought together by tragic circumstance: the former attempted suicide, and the latter was about to do the same—until she found out about her brother. The two reunite, and the movie dives deep and carefully into the subject of depression. Of course, the movie takes on a lighter tone as it goes along and we get to know the characters and they learn to accept themselves. Plus, the two great leads do what they're best at.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape finds a dysfunctional family where the titular character (Johnny Depp) is a young man who needs to care for his family members, including his mentally-impaired younger brother and mother, who's morbidly obsese and confined to her home as a result of an eating disorder. The movie not only explores the lives of the latter two characters amidst their impairments, but also the stress and anxiety that it puts on Gilbert as their de facto caretaker.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Matchstick Men (2003)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNicolas Cage does a lot of bad movies, but a lot of good movies too. Matchstick Men, where he plays a con man with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, is one of the good ones. The movie follows Cage's character and his partner, played by Sam Rockwell, as the two plan to pull off a big score—only to be interrupted by the discovery of Cage's character's daughter from a brief past marriage. One of director Ridley Scott's most underrated movies, and based on the novel of the same name.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerks of Being a Wallflower was a YA sensation when it was initially released as a novel by Stephen Chobsky, and it's proven to be just as lasting a success in film form (which Chobsky directed himself). The story follows Charlie, a high school freshman who's a bit shy and prone to anxiety at first, but manages to find himself as he makes high school friends.\n\nStream It Here\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Uncut Gems (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSometimes the most destructive of behaviors are mental illnesses, and a compulsive gambling addiction would certainly qualify. Uncut Gems isn't only Adam Sandler's best performance of his career, but the entire movie is fantastic, as Benny and Josh Safdie manage to get the audience on the side of Sandler's Howard Ratner, a man who risks far too much and brings his entire life to the brink as a way to appease his destructive urges to gamble on basically any and everything.\n\nStream It Here\n\n## Welcome to Me (2015)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWelcome to Me is one of the strangest movies on the list, anchored by a really winning performance from Kristen Wiig. The former SNL star here plays a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder who wins the lottery after stopping taking her medication, and immediately uses the money to buy and put on her own daytime talk show. The movie is just as wild as it sounds, but puts the spotlight on a mental illness that doesn't often get much publicity. Wiig does a great job of playing the character with real traits of Borderline Personality Disorder, including mood swings and inability to maintain relationships.\n\nStream It Here\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n## Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow ‘Reacher’ Season 3 Compares to the Book\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n‘Invincible’ Is Back Sooner Than We Expected\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n‘Reacher’ Is Finally Back for Season 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn '80s Staple Made an Epic '1923' Cameo\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Movies We Can’t Wait for in 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'1923' Continues the 'Yellowstone' Story With S2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'The Righteous' Gemstones' Goes Full '1923'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou Need To Be Watching ‘The White Lotus’ Season 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow Jon Gries Became 'White Lotus's Biggest Twist\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Complete Ranking of Bong Joon-ho Movies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Lumon Gang Is Back for ‘Severance’ Season 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Ultimate 'Sad Man in Space' Movie Ranking\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\n\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n\n©2025 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

                "Plot": "Following the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will refers to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit. A series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her in an honor killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage. While Nawal is at university in Daresh, civil war and war crimes break out, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Nawal leaves town to try to find her son and boards a bus full of Muslim refugees. Christian Nationalists shoot the driver and fire into the bus full of passengers, only missing Nawal and a mother with her child. As the Nationalists prepare to set the bus on fire, the survivors try to escape towards the back of the bus. Nawal shows her crucifix and tells the Nationalists that she is Christian. She attempts to save a child by claiming her as her own, but the child runs back towards the burning bus, calling for her mother, and is unceremoniously shot. Nawal finds her way back to town and joins the Muslim fighters. She tutors the son of a nationalist leader, eventually earning enough trust to smuggle in a gun to shoot the leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and sings through the screams of other prisoners, earning her the nickname 'The Woman Who Sings'. To attempt to break her, she is raped by torturer Abou Tarek who leaves her saying, 'Sing now.' She consequently gives birth to the twins. After traveling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May (the month he was born in) and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool and saw both the tattoo (proving him as her son) and his face (proving him as her rapist). The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke, which led to her decline and untimely death at age 60. The twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love. Horrified at the truth, Nihad tries to chase after the twins, but they are gone. Nawal gets her gravestone. Sometime later, Nihad visits it.",

                    "Development": "Director Denis Villeneuve adapted Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004. Parts of the story were based on the life of Souha Bechara. The story is based on events that happened during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous. Director Denis Villeneuve first saw Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies at Théâtre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 2004, commenting 'I had this strong intuition that I was in front of a masterpiece'. Villeneuve acknowledged unfamiliarity with Arab culture, but was drawn to Incendies as 'a modern story with a sort of Greek tragedy element'. In adapting the screenplay, Villeneuve, while keeping the story structure and characters, replaced 'all' the dialogue, even envisioning a silent film, abandoning the idea due to expense. He showed Mouawad some completed scenes to convince the initially reluctant playwright to grant permission for the film. Villeneuve spent five years working on the screenplay, in between directing two films. Mouawad later praised the film as 'brilliantly elegant' and gave Villeneuve full credit. The project had a budget of $6.5 million, and received funding from Telefilm Canada."

                    "BoxOffice": "In Canada, the film passed the $1 million mark at the box office by October 2010. By the end of April 2011, the film grossed $4.7 million. In Quebec theatres alone, Incendies made $3 million. It was considered a success in the country. According to Box Office Mojo, the film completed its theatrical run on 29 September 2011, after making $2,071,334 in the U.S. According to The Numbers, the film grossed $6,857,096 in North America and $9,181,247 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,038,343.",
                    "CriticalResponse": "Incendies received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% positive reviews based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, 'It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 80 out 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'. The film enjoyed a positive reception in its country and province. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal gave it 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, 'Villeneuve has done his best work yet here'. The Montreal Gazette's Brendan Kelly gave the film five stars and called it a 'masterwork'. Marc Cassivi of La Presse claimed the film transcended the play. Peter Howell, writing for The Toronto Star, gave the film four stars, called it 'a commanding film of multiple revelations', and the best of 2010, and praised Lubna Azabal as 'first amongst equals'. However, Martin Morrow of CBC News was unimpressed, saying, 'Villeneuve's screen adaptation strips away all this finely textured flesh and leaves only the bare bones'. University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote that the film, along with Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012), represent a break in the Cinema of Quebec from focus on local history to global concerns, with Incendies adding Oedipal themes. Authors Gada Mahrouse, Chantal Maillé and Daniel Salée wrote McCraw and Déry's films, Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar and Inch'Allah, depict Quebec as part of the global village and as accepting minorities, particularly Middle Easterners or 'Muslim Others'. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying 'it wants to be much more than a thriller and succeeds in demonstrating how senseless and futile it is to hate others because of their religion', and Azabal 'is never less than compelling'. He later selected the film as his favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it lost to In a Better World from Denmark. Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars, referring to it as 'tough, spellbinding'. Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film three and a half stars, praising a bus scene as harrowing but saying the climax is 'a plot twist that feels like one coincidence too far', that 'leaves the audience doing math on their fingers rather than reeling in shock'. Incendies was named by Stephen Holden of The New York Times as one of the 10 best films of 2011. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it Villeneuve's 'best-realized work yet'. A number of reviews complimented use of the song 'You and Whose Army?' by Radiohead. Criticisms have included charges of melodrama and orientalism."

                "Accolades": "On 22 September 2010, Incendies was chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. It made the shortlist on 19 January 2011, one of nine films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on 25 January 2011. It won eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actress for Azabal and Best Director for Villeneuve. Along with Incendies, Villeneuve won the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award in 2009 for the film Polytechnique, the first Canadian filmmaker to win it twice in a row. Incendies also won the Prix Jutra for Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actress (Azabal), Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Sound. It is also the only film to date to have won both the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film and the Vancouver International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film."

                "Plot": "Aging Reno, Nevada, police detective Jerry Black attends a retirement party hosted by his department during which Captain Pollack presents tickets to Jerry for a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime. Jerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with an intellectual disability, is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry's suspicions. Still adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from Heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places it loved in life, before delivering it to God. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called 'The Giant' shortly before she was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of 'The Giant', but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him. Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same modus operandi as seen with Ginny's, which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful. While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (against whom Lori has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy and even begins a romance with Lori herself. One day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station. Jerry suspects that Jackson is Ginny's killer after he invites Chrissy to his church. Jerry rushes to the church after Jackson picks her up one day while he is fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close call, and that Jackson is not the killer. Meanwhile, Chrissy meets a man who drives a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of Ginny's drawing that stood out to Jerry. That night, while reading her a bedtime story, Chrissy tells Jerry that she met a 'wizard' who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell anyone about their interaction. (A later scene hints that the chocolates are laced with narcotics.) Chrissy tells Jerry she is supposed to meet the 'wizard' again the next day at a nearby picnic area. Using Chrissy as bait, Jerry stages a sting operation with Stan's help to catch the killer. However, while on the way to the meeting, the 'wizard' dies in a car accident; hours later, the SWAT team gives up and leaves Jerry alone. They inform Lori of what is happening. She confronts Jerry angrily about putting Chrissy in danger and breaks up with him. Sometime later, Jerry sits by himself on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute, and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.",

She wakes up in the hospital with amnesia, recalling nothing about the incident or her life prior. A man by her bedside (Mike Vogel) introduces himself as Russell Williams, her husband, and says that her name is Jennifer. To help her regain memories, he shows her photos of her life, telling her that her parents died in a fire two years ago, that she had quit her job, and that she rarely talks to her friends anymore. Detective Frank Page (Dennis Haysbert), obsessed with his work after failing to find his own daughter's kidnapper, investigates Jennifer's accident and grows suspicious of Russell, who drives a truck similar to one seen in the vicinity where Jennifer was hit. After Jennifer is discharged, Russell takes her to their secluded home. Jennifer is haunted by brief flashes of memories from the rainy night of her accident. She becomes uneasy by Russell's strange behavior and realizes that he has been locking her inside the house at night. She also notices that most of the photos in her home have been manipulated. Frank's investigation leads him to Jennifer's parents' home, where he finds their rotting corpses. He learns from Jennifer's former employer that 'Russell' is actually Ryan Gaerity, a temperamental worker fired over two months ago. While Ryan is out, Jennifer finds her own ID in his wallet, which she uses to unlock his computer. She finds images of her actual husband Russell (Daniel Booko) and realizes the danger she's in. Before she can escape, Ryan knocks her unconscious and chains her to the bed while he goes out to get supplies. When he returns, the real Russell's corpse is revealed to be in his car trunk. Frank arrives at their home and tries to rescue Jennifer, but Ryan knocks him out, locking him in a freezer. He rants to Jennifer that he had loved her for years but her lack of reciprocation and marriage to Russell enraged him, leading him to kill Russell and take Jennifer for himself. Jennifer manages to escape into the forest with Ryan giving chase. Knowing that Jennifer will never love him, Ryan decides to kill her with his gun, but Frank tackles him before he can shoot her, and Jennifer takes the gun and shoots Ryan in the arm. A wounded Ryan desperately attempts to run towards Jennifer to retrieve the gun, but Jennifer fires another shot, ultimately killing Ryan. Three months later, Frank gives Jennifer a note from her late husband that he had found during the investigation. As she drives, leaving for San Jose, Russell's voice narrates the note, telling her how much he loves her.",

                "Plot": "Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, Money Monster. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but Camby unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland. Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives. With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it. Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong. Once Camby arrives, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to Johannesburg, South Africa. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper misses a shot at Lee, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where, according to Diane, Camby is headed. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, simply clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers. Camby had bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. Had his plan succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when mine work resumed and the owner's stock owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company. Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then Kyle, much to Lee's dismay, gets fatally shot by the police. Lee punches Camby, as his greed and corruption cost Kyle his life. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be placed under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Lee and Patty reconcile, wondering how they follow their last broadcast.",

It would be the company's first produced film. IM Global financed while Dubiecki produced, along with Stuart Ford. Alan Di Fiore and Jim Kouf wrote the script of the film. On October 11, 2012, Jodie Foster was set to direct the film. Lara Alameddine also produced the film. The story was altered from its original script inspired by the stock market glitch and crash of Cynk Technologies. On July 25, 2014, TriStar Pictures won the rights to finance and release the film, whose latest draft was written by Jamie Linden. Clooney and Grant Heslov also produced for their Smoke House Pictures.",
                    "Casting": "On May 8, 2014, it was announced that George Clooney was director Foster's choice to star in the film as a TV personality, Lee Gates, but the deal was not yet confirmed. Clooney's involvement was confirmed in July 2014. Jack O'Connell and Julia Roberts were added to the cast November 14, 2014 to star along with Clooney in the film. Caitriona Balfe joined the cast of the film on January 29, 2015, to play the head of PR of the company whose stock bottomed. Dominic West signed-on on February 25, 2015 to play the CEO of the company. Christopher Denham also joined the cast on March 4, 2015, playing Ron, a producer on the show.",
                    "Filming": "In October 2012, filming was scheduled to begin early 2013. In July 2014, it was announced that production would begin after Clooney completed the Coen brothers' Hail, Caesar!, and principal photography on the film began in New York City on February 27, 2015. On April 8, filming began on Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, where it would last for 15 days. A scene was also shot in front of Federal Hall National Memorial. Some re-shooting for the film took place in mid-January 2016 in New York City on William Street and Broad Street."

                "Release": "In August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment set the film for an April 8, 2016 release. The film was later pushed back to May 13, 2016. The Money Monster Premiered in Cannes on May 12, 2016, where the cast attended the photocall and screening in the evening.",
                "Reception": {
                    "BoxOffice": "Money Monster grossed $41 million in the United States and Canada, and $52.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $93.3 million, against a net production budget of $27 million. In North America, the film was released alongside The Darkness and the wide expansion of Green Room, and was projected to gross $10–12 million from 3,104 theaters in its opening weekend. The film grossed $600,000 from its early Thursday night previews and $5 million on its first day. It went on to gross $14.8 million in its opening weekend, beating expectations and finishing 3rd at the box office behind Captain America: Civil War and The Jungle Book. It fell 53% to $7 million in its second weekend, finishing 6th.",
                    "CriticalResponse": "On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site's critics consensus reads: 'Money Monster's strong cast and solidly written story ride a timely wave of socioeconomic anger that's powerful enough to overcome an occasionally muddled approach to its worthy themes.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating 'mixed or average reviews'. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of 'B+' on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 81% overall positive score, with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it. Clooney's performance was praised by critics. A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that the 'quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points.' Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com, in a mixed review, praised Clooney's 'enormous charisma', but criticized the film for not 'being quite as thrilling or thought-provoking as [its] premise sounds.' Chris Hewitt of Empire however gave a more positive review. Several reviewers praised the atmosphere of suspense. Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the film, particularly Foster's directing and her ability to 'keep things moving'. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that Foster 'keeps the action vigorous and the suspense high', but said that the film was 'swallowed up by the very hectoring and impersonal sensationalism that it derides.' Some reviewers criticized the script. Wendy Ide of The Observer gave the film a negative review, writing that the film lacks the 'authentic anger' of The Big Short and the 'sniper-like accuracy' of Network, criticizing Clooney's 'complete lack of sincerity'. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that what the script lacks in 'emotional subtext' can be found in the cast's 'richly detailed' performances. In a mixed review, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called the film a 'raucous hostage thriller that eschews explanation for wish-fulfillment', concluding by saying that 'in the heat of the moment, Money Monster's bluster and nerve keeps you hooked.' Josh Lasser of IGN was critical of the film's mix of comedy and drama, calling the transitions 'too fast, ripping the audience out of the unfolding drama.' Despite comparisons of Clooney's character to Jim Cramer and his TV show Mad Money, Clooney and Foster denied this."

I understand the need for character development, but there were just too many disjointed holes and illogical decisions made in the plot."

                "Plot": "In Monte Carlo, Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier) stops to speak to Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) only after recognizing her companion (Joan Fontaine), the woman he had encountered earlier. Maxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge, seemingly contemplating suicide. A young woman shouts at him to stop him in his tracks, but he curtly asks her to walk on. Later, at a Monte Carlo hotel, the same young woman, serving as a paid companion to the pompous aging Mrs. Van Hopper, again encounters the debonair widower de Winter. Aspiring to social prominence, Mrs. Van Hopper is obsequious to the aristocratic de Winter, but is soon confined to her room due to illness. Maxim invites the companion on excursions, which she conceals from her employer as tennis lessons, and the young woman soon becomes infatuated, though puzzled by such attention. On her recovery, Mrs. Van Hopper decides to leave Monte Carlo; her companion furtively informs Maxim of her departure, and Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. After being informed of the proposal by Maxim, a shocked Mrs. Van Hopper privately tells her companion that Maxim is marrying her as a desperate distraction because he is still tormented by thoughts of his beloved dead wife, Rebecca. She asserts that her companion is ill-prepared to be the second Mrs. de Winter and cannot hope to succeed as the mistress of the stately Manderley. Maxim brings his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in Cornwall. Manderley is dominated by its austere housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a cold and unyielding woman who had once been a confidante of the first Mrs. de Winter. Danvers harbors a deep resentment for the new Mrs. de Winter, whom she views as a usurper. Danvers feeds the bride's insecurity by showing her Rebecca's grand bedroom suite, left untouched and off-limits to the new wife, and by retaining items throughout the house that carry Rebecca's monogram. Eventually, constant reminders of Rebecca's glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his tragically drowned first wife, which could explain his restlessness and irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to assert her new role by holding a costume party as Maxim and Rebecca had done annually. Danvers suggests she copy the dress that one of Maxim's ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. However, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. When Mrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window of Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog and, during the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat with Rebecca's body in it has been discovered. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When Rebecca implied she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim's line. During a heated argument, Rebecca fell, struck her head, and died. Afraid he would be blamed for her death, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled; some days later, he identified another body that washed ashore as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her naïve ways. When the inquest considers the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, threatening to reveal a letter from Rebecca hinting at a pregnancy that made suicide improbable. When Maxim informs the police of the attempted blackmail, they must investigate Favell's accusations that Maxim murdered Rebecca. Further investigation with a doctor, however, reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her to ruin him. As a free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.",

Vincent accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself. Months later, Malcolm has begun working with Cole Sear, a nine-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his own failure to help Vincent and to reconcile with Anna, who is suffering from depression. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in it, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Once released, he faints and appears to have been physically assaulted, which his mother attributes to the bullies. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who are unaware that they are dead. Malcolm believes Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent was supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them. One night, Cole finds Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He works out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he gives to her father. The tape reveals that her stepmother poisoned her food, alerting her father to the cause of her death and saving her younger sister. Cole is given a lead part in his school play. He is coached by a ghost director and gives his performance with Malcolm looking on. Before leaving, Cole suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep so he can hear her thoughts and feelings. Cole tells Lynn his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her that his late grandmother visits him and describes details from his mother's childhood that he could not have known. Shocked, Lynn finally believes him. Malcolm returns home to find his wedding video playing and Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her. Suddenly, she drops his wedding ring, and he notices that he is not wearing it. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see, Malcolm locates his gunshot injury, and he realizes that he did not survive being shot by Vincent. He has been dead the entire time while working with Cole. Malcolm quickly comes to terms with the fact that he is a ghost and apologizes to Anna for haunting her and not letting her move on. He tells her that she was never second to anything and that he loves her. Anna indicates she is now at peace, and Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.",

                "Review": "I really recently just watched Donnie Darko and I was super blown away by it. I loved the movie's originality, atmosphere, and complexity. All of the characters were interesting and I cared about them. Particularly the acting from Jake Gyllenhaal was truly amazing.",
                "Themes Analysis": "The reason why I’m making this post is to examine the message and themes of Donnie Darko. Because the plot in itself is so complicated, I feel people are too focused on unraveling that to really talk about the actual themes and message of the film. Usually, looking up the analysis of a film would reveal its message and meaning. But doing that with this film only led me to websites talking about the time travel aspect of the movie. This is my first watch of my film, so I think I still need to pick up on a lot. What I saw was a theme of isolation and selflessness.",
                "Character Insights": "Donnie starts out as an isolated, resentful kid who’s cold towards his family. He also discusses with his therapist about dying alone, saying he fears it but also feels it’s unavoidable. I found this interesting as Donnie is quite clearly the cause of his own isolation as a result of his antisocial, cold behavior. He hates being so alone, but is also the cause behind such loneliness.",
                "Selflessness Theme": "I think selflessness/sacrifice is another theme present in the film. Depending on which theory you follow about the time travel stuff, it can be interpreted that Donnie willingly allows himself to be killed by the jet engine that falls through his bedroom.",
                "Foreshadowing": "I also noticed that when Donnie and Gretchen are exiting the theater, the camera clearly focuses on the movie titles. While most are Halloween based, there’s also the movie title of 'The Passion of Christ' - which isn’t a Halloween-y movie at all. I feel this was sort of foreshadowing of Donnie, a chosen person given special gifts who ultimately has to sacrifice himself.",
                "Mother's Role": "His mother also embodies this theme. Rather than be resentful of her son for his issues or his various outbursts, she completely loves him and accepts him.",
                "Final Thoughts": "Ultimately, these themes of isolation and sacrifice connect to form the theme of 'destruction leads to creation'. In the ending of the film, Donnie is afraid to die alone, but seconds before being hit by a jet engine - he starts laughing."

                "Plot": "Sean and Anna are a married couple living in New York City. At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies. Ten years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fiancé, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on. Sometime later, at a party for Anna's mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband. That night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms. Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning. Anna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt. When Anna misses an appointment with her fiancé to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips. Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused. When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean's edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.",

                "Production": "Director Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about 'the idea of eternal love' and a 'mystery of the heart'. While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a 'paranormal piece'. He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on. The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: 'There's this little kid and he tells a woman he's her dead husband – and he's ten years old.' Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière at his producer's recommendation. Carrière ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant. The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story. With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead. 'We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,' said Glazer. 'I'm not a Buddhist and I don't believe in reincarnation; I don't think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.'"

Throughout his stay, Craig bonds with various patients in the psychiatric unit, including Bobby, who takes Craig under his wing.

Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in Los Angeles and suggests that he come to stay with her in their childhood hometown of Nyack, New York. He agrees and meets Maggie's husband Lance. Milo is surprised when Lance tells him that he and Maggie are trying to have a baby, as Maggie never expressed a desire for children. Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking contraceptive pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she had been having sex with her scuba instructor Billy. She worries that she is not worthy of Lance, but Milo reassures her. Milo reconnects with his high school English teacher Rich, with whom he had a sexual relationship when he was 15. Rich now has a sixteen-year-old son and is dating a woman. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later, Milo appears at Rich's house while his son is there. This infuriates Rich, who does not want his past exposed. Maggie is also upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich, as she exposed the relationship to end it as well as Rich's teaching career. Milo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, a boy who their father had assured him would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turns out that the bully has a successful happy life, and it is Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he will not kill himself, and he promises to try not to. Lance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, leading Lance to find the contraceptives. Maggie ends the relationship with Billy and returns home where she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no 'marriage', and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide he should do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note and goes to the pool where she had been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to her body, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps into the pool and rescues her. The film closes with the twins at Maggie's house, looking at their new fish tank filled with goldfish.",

After his father's premature death, Gilbert has assumed the responsibility of caring for Arnie, his developmentally delayed younger brother. In addition to being Arnie's caregiver, Gilbert is expected to hold a steady job in order to provide for the family financially. Amy, Gilbert's older sister, assumes the maternal role. She cooks and cleans the family's home, and she even assists in its many repairs. However, it becomes clear that each family member is burdened by their responsibilities. They are still young, and it is evident that their emotional development has been stunted because they have been expected to behave like adults. Once Becky comes to town, the Grape family is pushed to re-evaluate their functionality, their domestic duties, and their own mental health statuses in order to preserve their longevity.",

                    "The opening scene of the campers driving through Endora reveals that Gilbert Grape desires freedom but is ultimately deprived of it. In this way, Endora's vast landscape is, ironically, Gilbert's trap. When Gilbert meets Becky, he begins to understand that she personifies freedom.",
                    "This film, undoubtedly influenced by the cinéma vérité style, provides a realistic depiction of love. We see how each member of the Grape family loves one another.",
                    "The Grape family deviates from the traditional American family. Instead of Bonnie providing for her entire family, the children are forced to provide for their mother.",
                    "Although there are many ways in which courage is represented in the film, the two scenes in which Bonnie moves from the couch demonstrate her courageous spirit.",
                    "As Gilbert, Tucker, and Bobby sit in the town's diner, they ponder the meaning of life and its fleeting nature."

It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being \"Inception\". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found \"Shutter Island\" to be much more superior, as \"Inception\" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.\n\nGood.\n\"Shutter Island\" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many \"illusions\" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from \"Memento\" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.\n\nConclusion.\nOn the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of \"Shutter Island\". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.\n\nRating.\nScore : absolute 10/10\nGrade : A+\n\n- NpMoviez\n- Jul 28, 2018\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ14\n\n- What is \"Shutter Island\" about?\n- Is \"Shutter Island\" based on a book?\n- Who is Andrew Laeddis?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - February 18, 2010 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Ebook\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - German\n- Also known as\n    - La isla siniestra\n- Filming locations\n    - Peddocks Island, Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Paramount Pictures\n    - Phoenix Pictures\n    - Sikelia Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $80,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $128,012,934\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $41,062,440\n    - Feb 21, 2010\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $294,972,125\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 18 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - SDDS\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - DTS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I — Masculinity\n\nby\n\n\nHal Kitchen\n\n\nOctober 5, 2020, 12:00 am \n\n7 Comments\n\nI never really liked Wind River. The first time I watched it though, I thought it was just a bit disappointingly rote, without the nail-biting tension of screenwriter Taylor Sheridan’s previous works like Sicario. I probably ascribed this discrepancy to Sheridan’s inexperience as a first time director, and lead actors Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen’s status as poor substitutes for Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro. However, I found myself starting to return to the movie over the following years. Not because it was growing on me, quite the opposite. It had got it’s teeth into me. It had got under my skin. I had a bone to pick with this movie.\n\nThis two-part series is intended as an exploration of the ways Wind River fails to effectively teach its progressive themes and how it instead falls back on regressive and inaccurate dominant cultural narratives. The first part will deal with the films portrayal of masculinity, and the second, longer entry will focus primarily on the topic of race.\n\nDespite its attempts to raise awareness of inter-sectional feminist issues, Wind River represents a more regressive depiction of sexual violence by exploring its theme almost exclusively through the perspective of its male protagonist, who is perpetually shielded by a stoicism that the film never effectively challenges. It also heavily reinforces regressive conceptions of gender roles in a way that is typical of the film’s writer-director Taylor Sheridan’s other work in the genre. This results in a complicated picture sending mixed messages about masculinity, where the narrative contradicts what the film is supposedly trying to tell us. Wind River is an effective example of some of the difficulties modern films are having reconciling concepts of masculinity with supposedly liberal ideologies.\n\nThe film is a procedural thriller, structured from a standpoint of empathy for women and with Native Americans. The film follows Corey Lambert (Jeremy Renner), a white professional hunter who agrees to assist FBI Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) in her investigation into the death of Natalie Hanson, (Kelsey Chow) a Native American woman, with the covert goal of exacting revenge on her killers on behalf of Natalie’s father Martin (Gil Birmingham).\n\nWind River was the directorial debut of screenwriter Taylor Sheridan. Sheridan received acclaim for his previous writing work on the films Hell or High Water and Sicario as well as the latter’s sequel Sicario: Day of the Soldado. In Wind River we see many tropes that appear in Sheridan’s other work, such as its police procedural elements, law enforcers breaking the law to achieve their goals, and invocations of frontier mythology. Specifically relevant to the subject under discussion are the ways that both Sicario and Wind River present their female leads, and imply threats of sexualised violence against the two women as a form of punishment for failure in a male dominated profession.\n\nWind River and Sicario both feature female federal law enforcers who are defined by their inexperience and naivete in comparison to their hyper-competent male partners. In both instances, Sheridan engineers a scenario where a naïve and inexperienced female is rescued from certain death at the hands of a sexualised male attacker by her armed and ruthless male colleague. In both cases, the male colleague’s presence is concealed from both the other characters in the scene, and the audience, up until the moment of their intervention. This puts both Sicario and Wind River within the context of what Candida Yates described as the “rescue-romance” in Masculine Jealousy and Contemporary Cinema: movies where the male hero saves the female from violence at the hands of another male and is rewarded by, if not love, at least a debt of gratitude.\n\nIn the final scene of Sicario—a film I greatly enjoy on the whole, although not its comparatively brainless sequel—the protagonist Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is confronted by her male colleague Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) who tells her: “You should move to a small town, where the rule of law still exists. You will not survive here. You’re not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves now.” This scene somewhat mirrors the final farewell between the protagonists Cory Lambert and Jane Banner in Wind River, where, as Banner is recovering in the hospital after being rescued by Lambert, he tells her: “Wolves don’t kill the unlucky deer, they kill the weak ones”.\n\nThese two films offer narratives where female characters are presented as ill-equipped to deal with the realities of policing and are violently intimidated and physically punished by predatory males for their trespass, before finally being spared at the last moment through the interventions of a supposedly ‘good’ older male, who rescues them through violence before reinforcing the viewpoint that their agency is unwanted in such thriller narratives.\n\nThis is a common and established trope in the Western genre, described by Susan Hatty’s chapter in Masculinitites, Violence and Culture (2000) “Frontier Nation: Men at the Edge”:\n\nWesterns are a masculine protest against feminine domesticity and the Christian sacrifice and reform celebrated in the late 19th century woman’s novel. Westerns […] can be seen as a counterpoint to the emotional sensibilities of this literature and also as an attempt to deny, or even eradicate, femininity in American popular culture.\n\nTherefore, Sheridan’s invocation of the Western canon to deal with the invisibility of violence against indigenous women in popular culture could have had some significant relevance and potential for revisionism. However, the degree to which his films remain traditional Westerns that still deny the role of women in these narratives undermines his films’ ability to make progressive statements. As with Sicario, Wind River makes clear that the Frontier is no place for a woman, with the standing of the heroines of both films constantly diminished by their male co-stars.\n\nTo examine the portrayal of masculinity in Wind River it is first crucial to note that the film’s hero Cory Lambert is narratively speaking a “flat character”—he does not have a character arc. He is presented as hardy, highly competent and uncomplicatedly heroic from the start and remains so for the duration of the film. He is functionally the “impact character” from whose example the supporting characters learn. This is most clearly seen when he comforts his grieving friend Martin after finding Martin’s daughter Natalie, raped and murdered.\n\nThe advice he gives Martin is:\n\nI got some good news, and I got some bad news. The bad news is, you’re never gonna be the same, you’re never gonna be whole. Not ever again. You lost your daughter and nothing’s ever going to replace that. Now the good news is, as soon as you accept that, you’ll let yourself suffer. You’ll allow yourself to visit her in your mind. And you’ll remember all the love she gave, all the joy she knew. The point is Martin, you can’t steer from the pain. If you do, you’ll rob yourself. You’ll rob yourself of every memory of her.\n\nAlthough this advice has the potential to challenge the way male characters in Westerns deal with their emotions onscreen, it is not reinforced by the contextualizing of the narrative. Despite the fact that he is advocating the value of opening oneself up to emotionality, the advice is phrased in the manner of man-to-man tough-love platitudes, with Cory continually pausing to compose himself. Even when extolling the advantages of confronting one’s own pain, and in front of another grieving father, he fights to maintain his mask. Renner’s performance remains as stoic here as throughout the rest of the film.\n\nThis scene also displays some ambivalence about men seeking help with their feelings in itself. Although Cory is comforting Martin and telling him about how he found comfort in the words of another man, his introductory tone and language are almost ashamed of this:\n\nI went to a grief seminar…in Caspar…d’you know that? I dunno why…just wanted the bad to go away. Wanted answers to questions that couldn’t be answered.\n\nIn spite of the fact he is acknowledging that the experience helped him, he is dismissive and contemptuous of grief seminars, feeling the need to defend having been to one and distance himself from the acknowledging of weakness and open displays of vulnerability associated with them. This further contributes to the film’s central failing as a feminist text, that its characters talk a lot about their feelings, but the workings of the narrative tell a different story, where the most unfeeling character is most celebrated.\n\nThis is the inherent contradiction in Wind River’s representation of masculinity. We might argue that the film is aware of this character fault, attempting to present Cory as a man who failed to suffer and is warning Martin not to make his same mistake, but his stoicism is never challenged by the narrative and his behaviour is reinforced by the glorification of his potency as a hero. As a result, the film undermines its own message, telling audiences about the value of their emotions while showing them the strength and efficacy that results from not feeling, as it is the stoical Cory who saves the day and avenges Natalie’s rape when more sensitive, feminine characters are unable to.\n\nWind River features a kind of twist as to the identity of the rapist. We hear about Natalie’s white boyfriend Matt (Jon Bernthal), who has been missing since her disappearance and he becomes the primary suspect until he is also found dead. Later, as Banner is waiting outside a cabin to meet a new suspect—a man named Pete (James Jordan), who we later learn is the actual rapist—we are introduced to a character as he is shaving inside the cabin. He is shirtless, bearded and built with intimidating muscles. However, when he comes to answer the door it is revealed that this is not Pete but the as yet unseen Matt, Natalie’s loving boyfriend who was killed defending her.\n\nThis scene—actually a flashback—plays with the audience’s expectations of what a rapist looks like, presuming an audience would believe a rapist to be manly and physically powerful and then undercutting this supposition by revealing that this man is not the villain and is in fact a model boyfriend. This twist acts as a rejection of the idea that a rugged masculinity is connected with mistreatment of women as the overtly masculine Matt is contrasted against the ineffectual, hysterical and immature Pete.\n\nThis jolt to the audience’s expectations functions to challenge their supposed assumptions for pre-judging men as abusers by using film language to lead them to the presumption that Matt is the rapist and then revealing his innocence. This could be read as a reactionary response to the challenge to masculinity presented by the specter of rape in the film, where the masculinity of Matt is temporarily suspected only in order to be exonerated.\n\nThe real rapists are Matt’s friends and co-workers, principally Pete, who shares a trailer with him. Natalie’s rape takes place when, as we see in this flashback, Pete and the others returned home unexpectedly, drunkenly walking in on Matt and Natalie in bed together. The film presents an effectively uncomfortable scenario as the sexually frustrated Pete becomes increasingly intrusive with Natalie while the others do nothing to intervene. The situation escalates and becomes violent, ultimately ending with Natalie, having been raped, running home through the wintry night and freezing to death.\n\nThe social problems that the film seems to be addressing are usually framed as products of urban life, and the resolution offered is found in the natural order represented by the frontier wilderness that Cory embodies. Agent Banner arrives from Las Vegas, unequipped for the Wyoming weather conditions and is shown through the narrative to be unsuited to the harshness of life there. The corrupting influence of city life is also shown in the graffiti strewn drug den where Natalie’s wayward brother is found. The most notable example though is in the final confrontation with Pete, who when challenged for his behaviour, hysterically laments that he raped Natalie because there was nothing else to do:\n\nYou don’t know what it’s like! Out here in this frozen hell. There’s no nothin’ to do. No nothin’. Ain’t no women. No fun. There’s just f—-n’, just f—-n’ snow. And f—-n’ silence. That’s all.\n\nPete represents the figure of the rapist in the film, but also a chaotic, soft urban masculinity unable to deal with the brutal natural order either mentally or physically. He is a reversal of the hillbilly rapist trope as seen in films such as I Spit On Your Grave and Sudden Impact dissected by Peter Lehmen in his 1993 work, or the nihilistic rural violence of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’s (1974) Sawyer family as described by Carol Clover in her seminal book Men Women and Chainsaws (1987). This time it is the urban chaos that is rejected, in contrast to the serene masculine authority represented by Cory and the sublime natural order that so terrifies Pete.\n\nThe resolution to Pete’s character is that Cory leaves him to die in the same manner Natalie was: “I’m going to give you the same chance she got”. Left to walk home barefoot through the snow, he dies of the cold in seconds. This leads us back to the film’s idea of strength: “Wolves don’t kill the unlucky deer, they kill the weak ones”. This scene underlines another incoherence in the way Wind River understands the idea of strength. Much focus is placed on the strength Natalie displays in running barefoot through the snow, but she still dies, and is therefore characterised by this line as “weak”. This is typical of the problem often faced when films attempt to build narratives of female empowerment around premises of sexual assault. As stated by Diane Shoos in her book Domestic Violence in Hollywood Film:\n\nThis is the dichotomy to be confronted when depicting victims escape from abuse, emphasising the need for strength on the part of the victim, but equally acknowledging and providing for, the weakness instilled by victimhood.\n\nLike its attempts to advocate male emotional openness, Wind River’s celebration of the strength displayed by assault victims is undercut by its strict adherence to Western thriller conventions. The film enforces ideas of absolutes and natural order, its core belief being that the environment in which the film is set mercilessly punishes any who do not have the “strength” to survive. The implication of course being that neither Natalie, nor Pete, nor Banner, who survives only through Lambert’s intervention, were strong enough to survive in the wilderness, while Lambert himself, is. Not only is it our male hero who dispatches the rapist villains, but the killing blow is delivered by the elements themselves, the final rapist freezing to death in the same manner as his victim.\n\nWind River, even in its very title, venerates a natural order that brutally punishes all but the manliest and in which the undisciplined, chaotic, unmanly urban characters such as Pete and Banner cannot survive.\n\nAlthough typical of an identifiable approach to sexual assault in genre fiction, where positive, ordered masculine archetypes are juxtaposed against the negative ones, to whom the behaviour of sexual assault is assigned, Wind River is somewhat atypical in its date of release and the comparative lack of negative criticism it has received, with many focusing on its portrayal of male grief as a positive.\n\nHowever, Wind River is a particularly good example of a defensive male approach to this subject matter, as among its many genre tropes, it presents a portrait of masculinity that forms a de facto rejection of the proposition that the male hero of Hollywood myth is in any way problematic. It reinforces traditional gender roles, disavowing open displays of feeling as being healthy behaviour for male characters or authoritative, dangerous work as befitting females. As a result, its attempts to discuss issues of sexual violence against indigenous women, in a narrative that so effectively silences women of all backgrounds, comes across as unconvincing, condescending and dated in the context of 2017. Ultimately, despite its apparent attempts to advocate emotional openness, Wind River ends up merely continuing the veneration of the stoical masculine hero of Western myth.\n\n## Help us keep the conversation alive!\n\nFind our new content easily by following us on BlueSky, Instagram, or Facebook.

I agree they painted the natives to seem helpless though maybe you’re missing the fact that everyone is helpless in that environment and the main character is one of the few who knew how to go about the land, and that’s not to forget that he very well may have learned this from natives. Jane is not a representation for women, she represents larger law enforcement and Taylor pinned that very well showing her naivety. The actual women’s representation is through the strength of the main victim. Corey’s daughter has a lack of depth because it is representing the lack of care for the thousands of other cold cases within the native culture, not to give him some hero back story. It gives humanity to show that any white man can be victim to loosing his daughter just as the natives have for years and bridge the gap of community to speak to a larger audience.\n\n\nReply\n- Donal says:\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 13, 2023 at 6:10 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSo Cory, as a hunter of predators, is the Uber-predator, at the apex of the “blood-chain”.  But a chain only as strong as its weakest link, the cubs which allow it to perpetuate.\nThe mother of those cubs need to be fighters. And there Wind River seems to lose its way.  Natalie was a fighter but is played by Kelsey Asbille (Chow) who claimed to be “part Cherokee”and to have a “Cherokee identity” but seems in fact to be of Chinese descent.  Isn’t that the ultimate sell-out of what Wind River purports to stand for?\nAnd Jane Banner is a fighter but comes from Florida (alligator country) totally, unbelievably, unprepared.  Barely an adult as Natalie’s father comments.  No hint of her motivations.  No sense that she is capable of motherhood.\nWorse I think than flawed.\nMendacious.\n\n\nReply\n- Donal says:\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 13, 2023 at 12:35 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nEspecially in view of the upcoming “Lioness” series.\n\n\nReply\n- Donal says:\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarch 13, 2023 at 12:31 am\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nThe role of animals in relation to The Hunter is also worth exploring.  There are the wolves, the horse, and especially the lioness and her cubs.  When the den is discovered it’s “end of the line, guys”.  Like Cory, the lioness has blinked and will lose her cubs.\n\n\nReply\n- Alex says: .comment-author October 5, 2022 at 5:17 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta My main problem with the movie was that once again a white man is the hero amongst people of color, solving their problems for them because they couldn’t possibly do so.

The first time I watched it though, I thought it was just a bit disappointingly rote, without the nail-biting tension of screenwriter Taylor Sheridan’s previous works like Sicario. I probably ascribed this discrepancy to Sheridan’s inexperience as a first-time director, and lead actors Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen’s status as poor substitutes for Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro. However, I found myself starting to return to the movie over the following years. Not because it was growing on me, quite the opposite. It had got its teeth into me. It had got under my skin. I had a bone to pick with this movie.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>This two-part series is intended as an exploration of the ways <Name>Wind River</Name> fails to effectively teach its progressive themes and how it instead falls back on regressive and inaccurate dominant cultural narratives. The first part will deal with the film's portrayal of masculinity, and the second, longer entry will focus primarily on the topic of race.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>Despite its attempts to raise awareness of inter-sectional feminist issues, <Name>Wind River</Name> represents a more regressive depiction of sexual violence by exploring its theme almost exclusively through the perspective of its male protagonist, who is perpetually shielded by a stoicism that the film never effectively challenges. It also heavily reinforces regressive conceptions of gender roles in a way that is typical of the film’s writer-director Taylor Sheridan’s other work in the genre. This results in a complicated picture sending mixed messages about masculinity, where the narrative contradicts what the film is supposedly trying to tell us. <Name>Wind River</Name> is an effective example of some of the difficulties modern films are having reconciling concepts of masculinity with supposedly liberal ideologies.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>The film is a procedural thriller, structured from a standpoint of empathy for women and with Native Americans. The film follows <Name>Cory Lambert</Name> (<Actor>Jeremy Renner</Actor>), a white professional hunter who agrees to assist <Actor>FBI Agent Jane Banner</Actor> (<Actor>Elizabeth Olsen</Actor>) in her investigation into the death of <Actor>Natalie Hanson</Actor> (<Actor>Kelsey Chow</Actor>), a Native American woman, with the covert goal of exacting revenge on her killers on behalf of Natalie’s father <Actor>Martin</Actor> (<Actor>Gil Birmingham</Actor>).</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p><Name>Wind River</Name> was the directorial debut of screenwriter <Director>Taylor Sheridan</Director>. Sheridan received acclaim for his previous writing work on the films Hell or High Water and Sicario as well as the latter’s sequel Sicario: Day of the Soldado. In <Name>Wind River</Name> we see many tropes that appear in Sheridan’s other work, such as its police procedural elements, law enforcers breaking the law to achieve their goals, and invocations of frontier mythology. Specifically relevant to the subject under discussion are the ways that both Sicario and <Name>Wind River</Name> present their female leads, and imply threats of sexualized violence against the two women as a form of punishment for failure in a male-dominated profession.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p><Name>Wind River</Name> and Sicario both feature female federal law enforcers who are defined by their inexperience and naivete in comparison to their hyper-competent male partners. In both instances, Sheridan engineers a scenario where a naïve and inexperienced female is rescued from certain death at the hands of a sexualized male attacker by her armed and ruthless male colleague. In both cases, the male colleague’s presence is concealed from both the other characters in the scene, and the audience, up until the moment of their intervention. This puts both Sicario and <Name>Wind River</Name> within the context of what Candida Yates described as the “rescue-romance” in Masculine Jealousy and Contemporary Cinema: movies where the male hero saves the female from violence at the hands of another male and is rewarded by, if not love, at least a debt of gratitude.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>In the final scene of Sicario—a film I greatly enjoy on the whole, although not its comparatively brainless sequel—the protagonist <Actor>Kate Macer</Actor> (<Actor>Emily Blunt</Actor>) is confronted by her male colleague <Actor>Alejandro</Actor> (<Actor>Benicio del Toro</Actor>) who tells her: “You should move to a small town, where the rule of law still exists. You will not survive here. You’re not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves now.” This scene somewhat mirrors the final farewell between the protagonists <Actor>Cory Lambert</Actor> and <Actor>Jane Banner</Actor> in <Name>Wind River</Name>, where, as Banner is recovering in the hospital after being rescued by Lambert, he tells her: “Wolves don’t kill the unlucky deer, they kill the weak ones”.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>These two films offer narratives where female characters are presented as ill-equipped to deal with the realities of policing and are violently intimidated and physically punished by predatory males for their trespass, before finally being spared at the last moment through the interventions of a supposedly ‘good’ older male, who rescues them through violence before reinforcing the viewpoint that their agency is unwanted in such thriller narratives.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>This is a common and established trope in the Western genre, described by Susan Hatty’s chapter in Masculinitities, Violence and Culture (2000) “Frontier Nation: Men at the Edge”: Westerns are a masculine protest against feminine domesticity and the Christian sacrifice and reform celebrated in the late 19th century woman’s novel. Westerns […] can be seen as a counterpoint to the emotional sensibilities of this literature and also as an attempt to deny, or even eradicate, femininity in American popular culture.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>Therefore, Sheridan’s invocation of the Western canon to deal with the invisibility of violence against indigenous women in popular culture could have had some significant relevance and potential for revisionism. However, the degree to which his films remain traditional Westerns that still deny the role of women in these narratives undermines his films’ ability to make progressive statements. As with Sicario, <Name>Wind River</Name> makes clear that the Frontier is no place for a woman, with the standing of the heroines of both films constantly diminished by their male co-stars.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>To examine the portrayal of masculinity in <Name>Wind River</Name> it is first crucial to note that the film’s hero <Actor>Cory Lambert</Actor> is narratively speaking a “flat character”—he does not have a character arc. He is presented as hardy, highly competent and uncomplicatedly heroic from the start and remains so for the duration of the film. He is functionally the “impact character” from whose example the supporting characters learn. This is most clearly seen when he comforts his grieving friend <Actor>Martin</Actor> after finding Martin’s daughter <Actor>Natalie</Actor>, raped and murdered.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>The advice he gives Martin is: “I got some good news, and I got some bad news. The bad news is, you’re never gonna be the same, you’re never gonna be whole. Not ever again. You lost your daughter and nothing’s ever going to replace that. Now the good news is, as soon as you accept that, you’ll let yourself suffer. You’ll allow yourself to visit her in your mind. And you’ll remember all the love she gave, all the joy she knew. The point is Martin, you can’t steer from the pain. If you do, you’ll rob yourself. You’ll rob yourself of every memory of her.”</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>Although this advice has the potential to challenge the way male characters in Westerns deal with their emotions onscreen, it is not reinforced by the contextualizing of the narrative. Despite the fact that he is advocating the value of opening oneself up to emotionality, the advice is phrased in the manner of man-to-man tough-love platitudes, with <Actor>Cory</Actor> continually pausing to compose himself. Even when extolling the advantages of confronting one’s own pain, and in front of another grieving father, he fights to maintain his mask. <Actor>Renner</Actor>’s performance remains as stoic here as throughout the rest of the film.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>This scene also displays some ambivalence about men seeking help with their feelings in itself. Although <Actor>Cory</Actor> is comforting <Actor>Martin</Actor> and telling him about how he found comfort in the words of another man, his introductory tone and language are almost ashamed of this: “I went to a grief seminar…in Caspar…d’you know that? I dunno why…just wanted the bad to go away. Wanted answers to questions that couldn’t be answered.”</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>In spite of the fact he is acknowledging that the experience helped him, he is dismissive and contemptuous of grief seminars, feeling the need to defend having been to one and distance himself from the acknowledging of weakness and open displays of vulnerability associated with them. This further contributes to the film’s central failing as a feminist text, that its characters talk a lot about their feelings, but the workings of the narrative tell a different story, where the most unfeeling character is most celebrated.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>This is the inherent contradiction in <Name>Wind River</Name>’s representation of masculinity. We might argue that the film is aware of this character fault, attempting to present <Actor>Cory</Actor> as a man who failed to suffer and is warning <Actor>Martin</Actor> not to make his same mistake, but his stoicism is never challenged by the narrative and his behaviour is reinforced by the glorification of his potency as a hero. As a result, the film undermines its own message, telling audiences about the value of their emotions while showing them the strength and efficacy that results from not feeling, as it is the stoical <Actor>Cory</Actor> who saves the day and avenges <Actor>Natalie</Actor>’s rape when more sensitive, feminine characters are unable to.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p><Name>Wind River</Name> features a kind of twist as to the identity of the rapist. We hear about <Actor>Natalie</Actor>’s white boyfriend <Actor>Matt</Actor> (<Actor>Jon Bernthal</Actor>), who has been missing since her disappearance and he becomes the primary suspect until he is also found dead. Later, as <Actor>Banner</Actor> is waiting outside a cabin to meet a new suspect—a man named <Actor>Pete</Actor> (<Actor>James Jordan</Actor>), who we later learn is the actual rapist—we are introduced to a character as he is shaving inside the cabin. He is shirtless, bearded and built with intimidating muscles. However, when he comes to answer the door it is revealed that this is not <Actor>Pete</Actor> but the as yet unseen <Actor>Matt</Actor>, <Actor>Natalie</Actor>’s loving boyfriend who was killed defending her.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>This scene—actually a flashback—plays with the audience’s expectations of what a rapist looks like, presuming an audience would believe a rapist to be manly and physically powerful and then undercutting this supposition by revealing that this man is not the villain and is in fact a model boyfriend. This twist acts as a rejection of the idea that a rugged masculinity is connected with mistreatment of women as the overtly masculine <Actor>Matt</Actor> is contrasted against the ineffectual, hysterical and immature <Actor>Pete</Actor>.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>This jolt to the audience’s expectations functions to challenge their supposed assumptions for pre-judging men as abusers by using film language to lead them to the presumption that <Actor>Matt</Actor> is the rapist and then revealing his innocence. The real rapists are <Actor>Matt</Actor>’s friends and co-workers, principally <Actor>Pete</Actor>, who shares a trailer with him. <Actor>Natalie</Actor>’s rape takes place when, as we see in this flashback, <Actor>Pete</Actor> and the others returned home unexpectedly, drunkenly walking in on <Actor>Matt</Actor> and <Actor>Natalie</Actor> in bed together. The film presents an effectively uncomfortable scenario as the sexually frustrated <Actor>Pete</Actor> becomes increasingly intrusive with <Actor>Natalie</Actor> while the others do nothing to intervene. The situation escalates and becomes violent, ultimately ending with <Actor>Natalie</Actor>, having been raped, running home through the wintry night and freezing to death.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>The social problems that the film seems to be addressing are usually framed as products of urban life, and the resolution offered is found in the natural order represented by the frontier wilderness that <Actor>Cory</Actor> embodies. <Actor>Agent Banner</Actor> arrives from Las Vegas, unequipped for the Wyoming weather conditions and is shown through the narrative to be unsuited to the harshness of life there. The corrupting influence of city life is also shown in the graffiti-strewn drug den where <Actor>Natalie</Actor>’s wayward brother is found. The most notable example though is in the final confrontation with <Actor>Pete</Actor>, who when challenged for his behaviour, hysterically laments that he raped <Actor>Natalie</Actor> because there was nothing else to do: “You don’t know what it’s like! Out here in this frozen hell. There’s no nothin’ to do. No nothin’. Ain’t no women. No fun. There’s just f—-n’, just f—-n’ snow. And f—-n’ silence. That’s all.”</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p><Actor>Pete</Actor> represents the figure of the rapist in the film, but also a chaotic, soft urban masculinity unable to deal with the brutal natural order either mentally or physically. He is a reversal of the hillbilly rapist trope as seen in films such as I Spit On Your Grave and Sudden Impact dissected by <Actor>Peter Lehman</Actor> in his 1993 work, or the nihilistic rural violence of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’s (1974) Sawyer family as described by <Actor>Carol Clover</Actor> in her seminal book Men Women and Chainsaws (1987). This time it is the urban chaos that is rejected, in contrast to the serene masculine authority represented by <Actor>Cory</Actor> and the sublime natural order that so terrifies <Actor>Pete</Actor>.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>The resolution to <Actor>Pete</Actor>’s character is that <Actor>Cory</Actor> leaves him to die in the same manner <Actor>Natalie</Actor> was: “I’m going to give you the same chance she got”. Left to walk home barefoot through the snow, he dies of the cold in seconds. This leads us back to the film’s idea of strength: “Wolves don’t kill the unlucky deer, they kill the weak ones”. This scene underlines another incoherence in the way <Name>Wind River</Name> understands the idea of strength. Much focus is placed on the strength <Actor>Natalie</Actor> displays in running barefoot through the snow, but she still dies, and is therefore characterised by this line as “weak”. This is typical of the problem often faced when films attempt to build narratives of female empowerment around premises of sexual assault. As stated by <Actor>Diane Shoos</Actor> in her book Domestic Violence in Hollywood Film: This is the dichotomy to be confronted when depicting victims escape from abuse, emphasising the need for strength on the part of the victim, but equally acknowledging and providing for, the weakness instilled by victimhood.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>Like its attempts to advocate male emotional openness, <Name>Wind River</Name>’s celebration of the strength displayed by assault victims is undercut by its strict adherence to Western thriller conventions. The film enforces ideas of absolutes and natural order, its core belief being that the environment in which the film is set mercilessly punishes any who do not have the “strength” to survive. The implication of course being that neither <Actor>Natalie</Actor>, nor <Actor>Pete</Actor>, nor <Actor>Banner</Actor>, who survives only through <Actor>Lambert</Actor>’s intervention, were strong enough to survive in the wilderness, while <Actor>Lambert</Actor> himself, is. Not only is it our male hero who dispatches the rapist villains, but the killing blow is delivered by the elements themselves, the final rapist freezing to death in the same manner as his victim.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p><Name>Wind River</Name>, even in its very title, venerates a natural order that brutally punishes all but the manliest and in which the undisciplined, chaotic, unmanly urban characters such as <Actor>Pete</Actor> and <Actor>Banner</Actor> cannot survive.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>Although typical of an identifiable approach to sexual assault in genre fiction, where positive, ordered masculine archetypes are juxtaposed against the negative ones, to whom the behaviour of sexual assault is assigned, <Name>Wind River</Name> is somewhat atypical in its date of release and the comparative lack of negative criticism it has received, with many focusing on its portrayal of male grief as a positive.</p>\n        </section>\n        \n        <section>\n            <p>However, <Name>Wind River</Name> is a particularly good example of a defensive male approach to this subject matter, as among its many genre tropes, it presents a portrait of masculinity that forms a de facto rejection of the proposition that the male hero of Hollywood myth is in any way problematic. It reinforces traditional gender roles, disavowing open displays of feeling as being healthy behaviour for male characters or authoritative, dangerous work as befitting females. As a result, its attempts to discuss issues of sexual violence against indigenous women, in a narrative that so effectively silences women of all backgrounds, comes across as unconvincing, condescending and dated in the context of 2017. Ultimately, despite its apparent attempts to advocate emotional openness, <Name>Wind River</Name> ends up merely continuing the veneration of the stoical masculine hero of Western myth.</p>\n        </section>\n    </content>\n</article>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while organizing it into a structured format with XML tags that correspond to the attributes defined in the ADT.

Things don't go well, and Nick, who is mentally handicapped, gets arrested. Connie then begins a night-long odyssey to try and get his brother free while avoiding the cops himself, running into an assortment of fringe characters along the way. Also featuring Buddy Duress, Taliah Webster, Barkhad Abdi, Peter Verby, Robert Clohessy, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.\n\nFilmed in a gritty manner with over-saturated colors and a relentless electronic score, once this movie gets started it becomes an adrenaline-fueled marathon of tense situations, with Pattinson's character consistently asked to make split-second decisions that go wrong as often as right. I consider Robert Pattinson one of the least impressive movie stars to have sprung up in the last decade, but he acquits himself well here, grungy, desperate and vulpine. All of the supporting characters are believable, although largely unsavory. I wasn't quite as impressed with the end result as some critics, as I felt that the story stumbled to an unsatisfying conclusion, and nothing really added up to much, with events virtually ending where they began. That may have been the filmmakers point, but the majority of the film is a tense journey that crime film fans should enjoy.\n\n- AlsExGal\n- Nov 23, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 12, 2017 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site (Japan)\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Good Time: Viviendo al límite\n- Filming locations\n    - Adventureland - 2245 Broadhollow Road, Farmingdale, Long Island, New York, USA(adventureland amusement park scene)\n- Production companies\n    - Elara Pictures\n    - Hercules Film Fund\n    - Rhea Films (II)\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $4,500,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $2,026,499\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $125,101\n    - Aug 13, 2017\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $3,274,936\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 42 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Good Time (2017) in Canada?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig as journalist Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, it tells the story of Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a girl from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years ago. He recruits the help of Salander, a computer hacker.\n\nSony Pictures began development on the film in 2009. It took the company a few months to obtain the film adaptation rights to the novel, while also recruiting Zaillian and Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo premiered at Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 12, 2011, and was released in the United States on December 21, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film grossed $232.6 million against a $90 million production budget and received acclaim from critics, with praise for Craig and Mara's performances as well as Fincher's direction, the score, and the film's tone and visuals. The film was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2011 and was a candidate for numerous awards, winning, among others, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing,[4] while Mara's performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 84th Academy Awards.[5]\n\nA soft reboot and sequel, The Girl in the Spider's Web, was released in October 2018.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn Stockholm, journalist Mikael Blomkvist is recovering from the legal and professional fallout of a libel suit brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. The wealthy Henrik Vanger offers Blomkvist evidence against Wennerström in exchange for an unusual task: investigate the 40-year-old disappearance and presumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, 16-year-old Harriet.\n\nEvery year, Vanger receives a framed pressed flower, the type Harriet always gave him on his birthday. He believes her killer is taunting him. Blomkvist moves into a cottage on the Vanger family estate on Hedestad Island and starts his investigation.\n\nLisbeth Salander is an asocial investigator and hacker who is antagonized by her state-appointed guardian, Nils Bjurman. Bjurman controls Salander's finances and extorts sexual favors by threatening to have her institutionalized. In one meeting, Bjurman chains Salander to his bed and brutally anally rapes her, unaware his action is recorded. At their next meeting, Salander tasers Bjurman, binds him, rapes him with a steel dildo, and tattoos \"I'm a rapist pig\" across his chest. Using the recording she made, she blackmails him into giving her financial independence and ceasing contact with her.\n\nBlomkvist explores the island and interviews Vanger's relatives, most of whom were Nazis and Nazi sympathizers during World War II. He uncovers a list of names and numbers that are Bible verse references and recruits Salander as his research assistant. She discovers a connection between the list and young women brutally murdered from 1947 to 1967, indicating a serial killer. Many of the victims have Jewish names, making her theorize that the murders could have been motivated by antisemitism. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of his cat on the doorstep. Another night, a bullet grazes his forehead; after Salander tends to his wounds, they have sex. The pair learn that Harriet's late father, Gottfried, and later Martin, her brother, committed the murders.\n\nWhile looking for more proof, Blomkvist gets caught by Martin, gassed unconscious, and restrained in a specially prepared basement. Martin brags about killing and raping women for decades, like his father, but admits to not knowing what happened to Harriet. As Martin prepares to kill Blomkvist, Salander arrives and wounds Martin, forcing him to flee. Pursued by Salander on her motorcycle, Martin runs his car off the road and hits a propane tank, which blows up the car and kills him. As she nurses Blomkvist back to health, Salander reveals that she was institutionalized after attempting to burn her father alive as a child.\n\nThey deduce that Harriet is alive and in hiding; traveling to London, they find her. Harriet reveals that Gottfried sexually abused her when she was 14 for an entire year before she was able to defend herself, killing him in the process by drowning him.  After witnessing the murder, Martin continued to sexually abuse Harriet after Gottfried's death. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her off the island and let Harriet assume her identity in London, though Anita and her husband were later killed in a car accident. Finally free of her brother, Harriet returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.\n\nHenrik gives Blomkvist the promised information against Wennerström, but it proves to be outdated, and any statutes of limitations have run out. Salander reveals that she has hacked Wennerström's accounts and discovered he is laundering money for various criminal syndicates. She gives Blomkvist evidence of Wennerström's crimes, which Blomkvist publishes in a scathing editorial, ruining Wennerström and bringing Blomkvist to national prominence. Salander, in disguise, travels to Switzerland and removes two billion euros from Wennerström's secret accounts. Wennerström is later murdered in an apparent gangland shooting.\n\nOn her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him and his lover, Erika Berger, being affectionate. She discards the gift and rides away on her motorbike.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(left) and  respectively portray  and .\n\n- Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist: A co-owner for Swedish magazine Millennium, Blomkvist is devoted to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to \"go too far\".[6]\n- Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander: Salander is a computer hacker who has survived severe emotional and sexual abuse. The character was a \"vulnerable victim-turned-vigilante\" with the \"take-no-prisoners\" attitude of Lara Croft and the \"cool, unsentimental intellect\" of Spock. David Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling, and stated, \"there's a kind of wish fulfillment to her in the way that she takes care of things, the way she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well.\"[6]\n- Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger: Vanger is a wealthy businessman who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family \"dysfunctional\", Plummer said of the character: \"I love the character of the old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish.\"[7] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik.[8] \"I think that the old man would have it,\" he opined, \"because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them.\"[8] Julian Sands portrays a young Henrik Vanger.\n- Stellan Skarsgård as Martin Vanger: Martin is the current CEO of Vanger Industries. Skarsgård was allured by the character's dual nature, and was fascinated that he got to portray him in \"two totally different ways\".[9] Regarding Martin's \"very complex\" and \"complicated\" personality, the Swedish actor said, \"He can be extremely charming, but he also can seem to be a completely different person at different points in the film.\"[6] While consulting with Fincher, the director wanted Skarsgård to play Martin without reference to the book.[9]\n- Steven Berkoff as Dirch Frode, Head Legal Counsel for Vanger Industries\n- Robin Wright as Erika Berger: Blomkvist's business partner and editor-in-chief of Millennium magazine. She's also Blomkvist's occasional lover.\n- Yorick van Wageningen as Nils Bjurman: As Salander's legal guardian, he uses his position to sexually abuse her. Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, although he did not want to emulate the stereotypical \"mustache-twirling pervert\". The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor—one who was a \"full-fledged human being\" and a \"brilliant\" actor. \"He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside,\" Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, \"This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go through all that. I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding the humanity of him.\"[6]\n- Joely Richardson as Harriet Vanger: Henrik's long-lost grandniece who went into hiding posing as her cousin Anita. In performing her \"tricky\" character, Richardson recalled that Fincher wanted her to embrace a \"darker, edgier\" persona, without sugarcoating, and not \"resolved or healed\". \"Even if you were starting to move towards the direction of resolved or healed, he still wanted it edgy and dark. There are no straightforward emotions in the world of this film.\"[6] Moa Garpendal portrays a young Harriet Vanger.\n- Goran Višnjić as Dragan Armansky, head of Milton Security, Salander's employer\n- Donald Sumpter as Detective Morell.

By December, two major developments occurred for the project: Steven Zaillian, who had recently completed the script for Moneyball (2011), became the screenwriter, while producer Scott Rudin finalized a partnership allocating full copyrights to Sony.[10] Zaillian, who was unfamiliar with the novel, got a copy from Rudin. The screenwriter recalled, \"They sent it to me and said, 'We want to do this. We will think of it as one thing for now. It's possible that it can be two and three, but let's concentrate on this one.'\"[11] After reading the book, the screenwriter did no research on the subject.[12]\nDavid Fincher, who was requested with partner Ceán Chaffin by Sony executives to read the novel,[10][13]\nwas astounded by the Millennium series' size and success. As they began to read, the duo noticed that it had a tendency to take \"readers on a lot of side trips\"—\"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists,\" professed The Hollywood Reporter's Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: \"The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of.\" Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable \"they were headed in the same direction\".[10]\n\n\"I imagined someone who could move through the streets of Stockholm almost invisibly even though she looks the way she looks ... it's almost like a forcefield\"\n\nThe writing process consumed approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel.[11] Zaillian noted that, as time progressed, the writing accelerated. \"As soon as you start making decisions,\" he explained, \"you start cutting off all of the other possibilities of things that could happen. So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do.\" Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time.[11] Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a \"low-grade\" anxiety, \"but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease,\" he continued. \"I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything just for the sake of changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it.\"[14]\n\nZaillian discussed many of the themes in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher was familiar with the concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, \"A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different.\"[14] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. \"We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But at the same time you have to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed.\"[6] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is \"very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas.\"[15]\n\n### Casting\n\nDaniel Craig competed with George Clooney, Johnny Depp, Viggo Mortensen and Brad Pitt as candidates for the role of Mikael Blomkvist.[16][10] Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of Cowboys &amp; Aliens (2011) and Skyfall (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process.[10][17] Given the uncertainty surrounding Skyfall following Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's bankruptcy, Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part.[17] The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric. Having read the book amid its \"initial craze\", Craig commented, \"It's one of those books you just don't put down\" [...] There's just this immediate feeling that bad things are going to happen and I think that's part of why they've been so readable for people.\"[6]\n\nCasting of Lisbeth Salander was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Emily Browning, Eva Green, Anne Hathaway, Scarlett Johansson, Keira Knightley, Jennifer Lawrence, Carey Mulligan, Elliot Page, Natalie Portman, Léa Seydoux, Vanessa Hudgens, Sophie Lowe, Sarah Snook, Kristen Stewart, Olivia Thirlby, Mia Wasikowska, Emma Watson, Evan Rachel Wood and Yolandi Visser; Lowe, Rooney Mara, Seydoux, and Snook were the final four candidates.[18][19][20][21] Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay.[22] Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film The Social Network.[6][10] Fincher, while fond of the actress' youthful appearance,[23] found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander's antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the personable Erica Albright.[10] Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander. Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the appearance that she cut it herself.[24][25] In addition to her transgressive appearance, which was described as a \"mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth with a dash of S&amp;M temptress\" by Lynn Hirschberg of W,[24] Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.[10]\n\n### Filming\n\nStockholm, Sweden provided for much of the setting of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFincher and Zaillian's central objective was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. \"So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but its reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, but at the same time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image.\"[6] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, \"Its always an element in the background and it was very important that you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct.\"[6] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, \"It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design.\"[6]\n\nPrincipal photography began in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2010.[26] Production mostly took place at multiple locations in the city's central business district, including at the Stockholm Court House.[27] One challenge was realizing the Vanger estate. They picked an eighteenth-century French architecture mansion Hofsta located approximately 60 miles (97 km) southwest of Stockholm. Filmmakers wanted to use a typical \"manor from Småland\" that was solemn, formal, and \"very Old Money\". \"The Swedish are very good at the modern and the minimal but they also have these wonderful country homes that can be juxtaposed against the modern city—yet both speak to money.\"[6] Principal photography relocated in October to Uppsala. On Queen Street, the facade of the area was renovated to mimic the Hotel Alder, after an old photograph of a building obtained by Fincher.[28] From December onward, production moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where locations were established at Dolder Grand Hotel and the Zurich Airport.[29] Because of the \"beautiful\" environment of the city, Fincher found it difficult to film in the area.[30] Principal photography concluded in Oslo, Norway, where production took place at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Recorded for over fifteen hours, twelve extras were sought for background roles.[31] Filming also took place in the United Kingdom and the United States.[citation needed]\n\nIn one sequence the character Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsgård) plays the song \"Orinoco Flow\" by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, said that he believed that Martin \"doesn't like to kill, he doesn't like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music\" so therefore the character should play a song during the scene.[32] Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected \"Orinoco Flow\" on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said \"And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it's worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about? And he said, ‘You know, \"Sail away, sail away...\"’ And I thought, this guy is going to make Blomkvist as metro as we need.\"[32]\n\n#### Title sequence\n\nIn the \"Hot Hands\" vignette, the rough, gnarled hands caressing Salander's face represents systemic abuse of women by men.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Miller, creative director for the title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, as well as the character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. \"We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys,\" Miller explained, \"Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys.\"[33] Among Miller's many vignettes was \"The Hacker Inside\", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the \"cyber\" look for Salander, Miller said, \"Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together.\"[33]\n\nFincher wanted the vignette to be a \"personal nightmare\" for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. \"Early on, we knew it was supposed to feel like a nightmare,\" Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, standing in the middle of a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the \"gooey\" element that was so desired. \"David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette,\" Miller recalled. \"It ties everything together other than the black on black.\"[33]\n\nThe title sequence includes abundant references to the novel, and exposes several political themes. Salander's tattoos, such as her phoenix and dragon tattoos, were incorporated. The multiple flower representations signified the biological life cycle, as well as Henrik, who received a pressed flower each year on his birthday. \"One had flowers coming out of this black ooze,\" said Fincher, \"it blossoms, and then it dies. And then a different flower, as that one is dying is rising from the middle of it. It was supposed to represent this cycle of the killer sending flowers.\"[33] Ultimately, the vignette becomes very conceptual because Miller and his team took \"a whole thought, and cut it up into multiple different shots that are mixed in with other shots\". In one instance, Blomkvist is strangled by strips of newspaper, a metaphor for the establishment squelching his exposes.[33]\n\nIn the \"Hot Hands\" vignette, a pair of rough, distorted hands that embrace Salander's face and melt it represent all that's bad in men. The hands that embrace Blomkvist's face and shatter it, represent wealth and power.[33] Themes of domestic violence become apparent as a woman's face shatters after a merciless beating; this also ties in the brutal beating of Salander's mother Agneta Salander by her father Alexander Zalachenko, an event revealed in the sequel, The Girl Who Played with Fire (2006).[33]\n\nA cover of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\" (1970) plays throughout the title sequence. The rendition was produced by soundtrack composers Atticus Ross and Nine Inch Nails member Trent Reznor, and features vocals from Yeah Yeah Yeahs lead singer Karen O.[34] Fincher suggested the song, but Reznor agreed only at his request.[35] Led Zeppelin licensed the song only for use in the film's trailer and title sequence. Fincher stated that he sees title sequences as an opportunity to set the stage for the film, or to get an audience to let go of its preconceptions.[36]\n\nSoftware packages that were primarily used are 3ds Max (for modeling, lighting, rendering), Softimage (for rigging and animation), Digital Fusion (for compositing), Real Flow (for fluid dynamics), Sony Vegas (for editorial), ZBrush and Mudbox (for organic modeling), and VRAY (for rendering).[37]\n\n### Soundtrack\n\n\"[The instrumental sounds are] processed and stretched and manipulated into a setting where it may sound harmonically familiar, but if you tune into it, it's not behaving in a way that you're accustomed to that type of sound behaving. I find experimenting around in that is an interesting place to work.\"\n\nFincher recruited Reznor and Ross to produce the score; aside from their successful collaboration on The Social Network, the duo had worked together on albums from Nine Inch Nails' later discography.[38][39] They dedicated much of the year to work on the film, as they felt it would appeal to a broad audience.[40] Akin to his efforts in The Social Network, Reznor experiments with acoustics and blends them with elements of electronic music, resulting in a forbidding atmosphere. \"We wanted to create the sound of coldness—emotionally and also physically,\" he asserted, \"We wanted to take lots of acoustic instruments [...] and transplant them into a very inorganic setting, and dress the set around them with electronics.\"[38]\n\nEven before viewing the script, Reznor and Ross opted to use a redolent approach to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. \"We composed music we felt might belong,\" stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, \"and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head's at and he responded positively. He was filming at this time last year and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently.\" Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. \"We weren't working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'\"[40]\n\n## Marketing\n\n### Websites\n\nDuring production of the film, Sony created a Tumblr blog to see behind the scenes activities from the production of the soundtrack, costumes and set design.[41][42] This use of guerrilla marketing was used to draw fans in with its mysterious nature as to allude to   hidden websites which contained encrypted messages.[43] Found throughout these websites were new photos of props and when found, prizes would be awarded.[44] This tactic seemed to represent a similar style of an alternative reality game.\n\n### Clothing line\n\nPromotional material\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrish Summerville, the costume designer of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo collaborated with the clothing brand H&amp;M to release a Lisbeth Salander inspired collection which was announced on October 27, 2011.[45] The collection consisted of \"Leather motorcycle jackets, faux leather pants, t-shirts and a few varieties of shoes, including boots with studs and gray tennis shoes.\" of which the pieces were meant to appear as cyberpunk-esque, but also lived-in and gritty. The collection first appeared at the Paris-based boutique Collete on November 28, 2011, which was then opened to several H&amp;M locations on December 14, 2011. Journalists praised the release for its uses of a 'cross-promotional’ strategy.[46]\n\n## Release\n\n### Pre-release\n\nMara, Craig, and Fincher at the French premiere of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Paris.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA screening for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo took place on November 28, 2011, as part of a critics-only event hosted by the New York Film Critics Circle. Commentators at the event predicted that while the film would become a contender for several accolades, it would likely not become a forerunner in the pursuit for Academy Award nominations.[47] A promotional campaign commenced thereafter, including a Lisbeth Salander-inspired collection, designed by Trish Summerville for H&amp;M.[48][49] The worldwide premiere was at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 12, 2011,[50] followed by the American opening at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 14 and Stockholm the next day.[51][52] Sony's target demographics were men and women over the age of 25 and 17–34.[53] The film went into general release in North America on December 21, at 2,700 theaters,[54] expanding to 2,974 theaters on its second day.[54] The United Kingdom release was on December 26,[55] Russia on January 1, 2012,[56] and Japan on February 13.[57] India and Vietnam releases were abandoned due to censorship concerns.[58][59] A press statement from the Central Board of Film Certification stated: \"Sony Pictures will not be releasing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in India. The censor board has judged the film unsuitable for public viewing in its unaltered form and, while we are committed to maintaining and protecting the vision of the director, we will, as always, respect the guidelines set by the board.\"[59] In contrast, the National Film Board of Vietnam insisted that the film's withdrawal had no relation to rigid censorship guidelines, as it had not been reviewed by the committee.[58]\n\n### Home media\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film in a DVD and Blu-ray disc combo pack in the United States on March 20, 2012.[60] Bonus features include a commentary from Fincher, featurettes on Blomkvist, Salander, the sets and locations, etc.[61] The disc artwork for the DVD version of the film resembles a Sony brand DVD-R, a reference to the hacker Lisbeth Salander. This caused a bit of confusion in the marketplace with consumers thinking they had obtained a bootleg copy.[62][63] The release sold 644,000 copies in its first week, in third place behind The Muppets and Hop.[64] The following week, the film sold an additional 144,000 copies generating $2.59 million in gross revenue.[65] As of January 2014[update], 1,478,230 units had been sold, grossing $22,195,069.[66]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nFincher's film grossed $232.6 million during its theatrical run.[3] The film's American release grossed $1.6 million from its Tuesday night screenings,[54] a figure that increased to $3.5 million by the end of its first day of general release.[67] It maintained momentum into its opening weekend, accumulating $13 million for a total of $21 million in domestic revenue.[68] The film's debut figures fell below media expectations.[69][70][71] Aided by positive word of mouth,[72] its commercial performance remained steady into the second week, posting $19 million from 2,914 theaters.[73] The third week saw box office drop 24% to $11.3 million, totaling $76.8 million. The number of theaters slightly increased to 2,950.[74] By the fifth week, the number of theaters shrank to 1,907, and grosses to $3.7 million, though it remained within the national top ten.[75] The film completed its North American theatrical run on March 22, 2012, earning over $102.5 million.[3]\n\nThe international debut was in six Scandinavian markets on December 19–25, 2011, securing $1.6 million from 480 venues.[76] In Sweden the film opened in 194 theaters to strong results, accounting for more than half of international revenue at the time ($950,000).[76] The first full week in the United Kingdom collected $6.7 million from 920 theaters.[55] By the weekend of January 6–8, 2012, the film grossed $12.2 million for a total of $29 million; this included its expansion into Hong Kong, where it topped the box office, earning $470,000 from thirty-six establishments. The film similarly led the field in South Africa. It accumulated $6.6 million from an estimated 600 theaters over a seven-day period in Russia, placing fifth.[56] The expansion continued into the following week, opening in nine markets. The week of January 13–15 saw the film yield $16.1 million from 3,910 locations in over forty-three territories, thus propelling the international gross to $49.3 million.[77] It debuted at second place in Austria and Germany, where in the latter, it pulled $2.9 million from 525 locations.[77] Similar results were achieved in Australia, where it reached 252 theaters.[77] The film's momentum continued throughout the month, and by January 22, it had hit ten additional markets, including France and Mexico, from which it drew $3.25 million from 540 venues and $1.25 million from 540 theaters, respectively.[78] In its second week in France it descended to number three, with a total gross of $5.8 million.[79]\n\nThe next major international release came in Japan on February 13, where it opened in first place with $3.68 million (¥288 million)[57] in 431 theaters.[80] By the weekend of February 17–19, the film had scooped up $119.5 million from international markets.[81] The total international gross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was $130.1 million.[3] MGM, one of the studios involved in the production, posted a \"modest loss\" and declared that they had expected the film to gross at least 10% more.[82]\n\n### Critical response\n\nRooney Mara's performance as Lisbeth Salander garnered widespread critical acclaim, earning her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo received widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise for the cast, tone, score and cinematography. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 86% based on 259 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critics consensus states, \"Brutal yet captivating, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the result of David Fincher working at his lurid best with total role commitment from star Rooney Mara.\"[83] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[84] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[67]\n\nDavid Denby of The New Yorker asserted that the austere, but captivating installment presented a \"glancing, chilled view\" of a world where succinct moments of loyalty coexisted with constant trials of betrayal.[85] To USA Today columnist Claudia Puig, Fincher captures the \"menace and grim despair in the frosty Scandinavian landscape\" by carefully approaching its most gruesome features.[86] Puig noted a surfeit of \"stylistic flourishes\" and \"intriguing\" changes in the narrative, compared to the original film.[86] In his three-and-a-half star review, Chris Knight of the National Post argued that it epitomized a so-called \"paradoxical position\" that was both \"immensely enjoyable and completely unnecessary\".[87] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald said that the \"fabulously sinister entertainment\" surpassed the original film \"in every way\".[88] The film took two and a half stars from Rolling Stone commentator Peter Travers, who concluded: \"Fincher's Girl is gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark.\"[89] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, admired the moments of \"brilliantly orchestrated\" anxiety and confusion, but felt that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was vulnerable to the \"lumbering proceduralism\" that he saw in its literary counterpart, as evident with the \"long stretches of drab, hackneyed exposition that flatten the atmosphere\".[90] The Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern praised Cronenweth's cinematography, which he thought provided for glossy alterations in the film's darkness; \"Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors, and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack.\"[91] Rex Reed of The New York Observer professed that despite its occasional incomprehensibility, the movie was \"technically superb\" and \"superbly acted\".[92]\n\nThe performances were a frequent topic in the critiques. Mara's performance, in particular, was admired by commentators. A revelation in the eyes of Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman, he proclaimed that her character was more important than \"her ability to solve a crime\".[93] Her \"hypnotic\" portrayal was noted by Justin Chang of Variety,[94] as well as Salon critic Andrew O'Hehir, who wrote, \"Rooney Mara is a revelation as Lisbeth Salander, the damaged, aggressive computer geek and feminist revenge angel, playing the character as far more feral and vulnerable than Noomi Rapace’s borderline-stereotype sexpot Goth girl.\"[95] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club enjoyed the chemistry between Mara and Craig,[96] as did David Germain of the Associated Press; \"Mara and Craig make an indomitable screen pair, he nominally leading their intense search into decades-old serial killings, she surging ahead, plowing through obstacles with flashes of phenomenal intellect and eruptions of physical fury.\"[97] Although Puig found Mara inferior to Rapace in playing Salander, with regard to Craig's performance, he said that the actor shone.[86] This was supported by Morgenstern, who avouched that Craig \"nonetheless finds welcome humor in Mikael's impassive affect\".[91] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film was given a more assured quality than the original because of Fincher's direction and the lead performances, although he believed this did not always work to the film's advantage, preferring the original version's \"less confident surface\" where \"emotions were closer to the surface.\"[98]\n\n### Accolades\n\nIn addition to numerous awards, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was included on several year-end lists by film commentators and publications. It was named the best film of 2011 by MTV and James Berardinelli of ReelViews.[99][100] The former wrote, \"The director follows up the excellent Social Network with another tour de force, injecting the murder mystery that introduces us to outcast hacker Lisbeth Salander [...] and embattled journalist [...] with style, intensity and relentless suspense. Mara is a revelation, and the film's daunting 160-minute runtime breezes by thanks to one heart-racing scene after the next. Dark and tough to watch at times, but a triumph all around.\"[99] The film came second in indieWire's list of \"Drew Taylor's Favorite Films Of 2011\",[101] while reaching the top ten of seven other publications,[102] including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,[103] San Francisco Chronicle,[104] and the New Orleans Times-Picayune.[105] The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was declared one of the best films of the year by the American Film Institute,[106] as well as the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.[107]\n\n| Date of ceremony    | Award                                                       | Category                               | Recipients                                               | Result    |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| February 26, 2012   | 84th Academy Awards[108]                                    | Best Actress                           | Rooney Mara                                              | Nominated |\n| February 26, 2012   | 84th Academy Awards[108]                                    | Best Cinematography                    | Jeff Cronenweth                                          | Nominated |\n| February 26, 2012   | 84th Academy Awards[108]                                    | Best Film Editing                      | Angus Wall, Kirk Baxter                                  | Won       |\n| February 26, 2012   | 84th Academy Awards[108]                                    | Best Sound Editing                     | Ren Klyce                                                | Nominated |\n| February 26, 2012   | 84th Academy Awards[108]                                    | Best Sound Mixing                      | David Parker, Michael Semanick, Ren Klyce and Bo Persson | Nominated |\n| January 10, 2012    | Alliance of Women Film Journalists Awards[109]              | Best Film Music or Score               | Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross                               | Won       |\n| February 12, 2012   | American Society of Cinematographers Awards[110]            | Best Cinematography                    | Jeff Cronenweth                                          | Nominated |\n| February 12, 2012   | 65th British Academy Film Awards[111]                       | Best Cinematography                    | Jeff Cronenweth                                          | Nominated |\n| February 12, 2012   | 65th British Academy Film Awards[111]                       | Best Original Music                    | Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross                               | Nominated |\n| January 12, 2012    | Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards[112]              | Best Editing                           | Kirk Baxter, Angus Wall                                  | Won       |\n| January 12, 2012    | Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards[112]              | Best Composer                          | Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross                               | Nominated |\n| January 5, 2012     | Central Ohio Film Critics Association Awards[113]           | Best Picture                           | Best Picture                                             | Nominated |\n| January 5, 2012     | Central Ohio Film Critics Association Awards[113]           | Best Director                          | David Fincher                                            | Nominated |\n| January 5, 2012     | Central Ohio Film Critics Association Awards[113]           | Best Adapted Screenplay                | Steven Zaillian                                          | Won       |\n| December 19, 2011   | Chicago Film Critics Association Awards[114]                | Best Original Score                    | Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross                               | Nominated |\n| January 10, 2012    | Denver Film Critics Association Awards[115]                 | Best Actress                           | Rooney Mara                                              | Nominated |\n| January 28, 2012    | Directors Guild of America Awards[116]                      | Best Director                          | David Fincher                                            | Nominated |\n| January 15, 2012    | Golden Globe Awards[117]                                    | Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama    | Rooney Mara                                              | Nominated |\n| January 15, 2012    | Golden Globe Awards[117]                                    | Best Original Score                    | Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross                               | Nominated |\n| February 10, 2013   | Grammy Awards[118]                                          | Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media | Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross                               | Won       |\n| June 7, 2012        | Kerrang!

Mara was not expected to reprise her role,[135] though she later stated that she was still contractually signed on to do so.[136][137] The following year, Fede Álvarez was announced by Sony as director, as well as co-screenwriter with Steven Knight and Jay Basu.[138][139] The Girl in the Spider's Web was notably the first adaptation of an installment in the book series to be produced into an English-language film upon its initial release.[140] By March 2017, Álvarez announced that the film would have an entirely new cast, as he wanted the entire film to be his interpretation of the story.[141][142]\n\nIn September of the same year, Claire Foy was cast as Lisbeth Salander, replacing Mara.[143] The film was released in the U.S. on November 9, 2018.[144]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (18)\".

It is based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson. Starring <Name>Daniel Craig</Name> as journalist <Name>Mikael Blomkvist</Name> and <Name>Rooney Mara</Name> as <Name>Lisbeth Salander</Name>, it tells the story of Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a girl from a wealthy family who disappeared 40 years ago. He recruits the help of Salander, a computer hacker.\n\nSony Pictures began development on the film in 2009. It took the company a few months to obtain the film adaptation rights to the novel, while also recruiting Zaillian and Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo premiered at Odeon Leicester Square in London on <ReleaseYear>December 12, 2011</ReleaseYear>, and was released in the United States on <ReleaseYear>December 21, 2011</ReleaseYear>, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film grossed $232.6 million against a $90 million production budget and received acclaim from critics, with praise for Craig and Mara's performances as well as Fincher's direction, the score, and the film's tone and visuals. The film was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2011 and was a candidate for numerous awards, winning, among others, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, while Mara's performance earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 84th Academy Awards.\n\nA soft reboot and sequel, The Girl in the Spider's Web, was released in October 2018.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn Stockholm, journalist <Name>Mikael Blomkvist</Name> is recovering from the legal and professional fallout of a libel suit brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. The wealthy <Name>Henrik Vanger</Name> offers Blomkvist evidence against Wennerström in exchange for an unusual task: investigate the 40-year-old disappearance and presumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, 16-year-old <Name>Harriet</Name>.\n\nEvery year, Vanger receives a framed pressed flower, the type Harriet always gave him on his birthday. He believes her killer is taunting him. Blomkvist moves into a cottage on the Vanger family estate on Hedestad Island and starts his investigation.\n\n<Name>Lisbeth Salander</Name> is an asocial investigator and hacker who is antagonized by her state-appointed guardian, Nils Bjurman. Bjurman controls Salander's finances and extorts sexual favors by threatening to have her institutionalized. In one meeting, Bjurman chains Salander to his bed and brutally anally rapes her, unaware his action is recorded. At their next meeting, Salander tasers Bjurman, binds him, rapes him with a steel dildo, and tattoos \"I'm a rapist pig\" across his chest. Using the recording she made, she blackmails him into giving her financial independence and ceasing contact with her.\n\nBlomkvist explores the island and interviews Vanger's relatives, most of whom were Nazis and Nazi sympathizers during World War II. He uncovers a list of names and numbers that are Bible verse references and recruits Salander as his research assistant. She discovers a connection between the list and young women brutally murdered from 1947 to 1967, indicating a serial killer. Many of the victims have Jewish names, making her theorize that the murders could have been motivated by antisemitism. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of his cat on the doorstep. Another night, a bullet grazes his forehead; after Salander tends to his wounds, they have sex. The pair learn that Harriet's late father, Gottfried, and later Martin, her brother, committed the murders.\n\nWhile looking for more proof, Blomkvist gets caught by Martin, gassed unconscious, and restrained in a specially prepared basement. Martin brags about killing and raping women for decades, like his father, but admits to not knowing what happened to Harriet. As Martin prepares to kill Blomkvist, Salander arrives and wounds Martin, forcing him to flee. Pursued by Salander on her motorcycle, Martin runs his car off the road and hits a propane tank, which blows up the car and kills him. As she nurses Blomkvist back to health, Salander reveals that she was institutionalized after attempting to burn her father alive as a child.\n\nThey deduce that Harriet is alive and in hiding; traveling to London, they find her. Harriet reveals that Gottfried sexually abused her when she was 14 for an entire year before she was able to defend herself, killing him in the process by drowning him. After witnessing the murder, Martin continued to sexually abuse Harriet after Gottfried's death. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her off the island and let Harriet assume her identity in London, though Anita and her husband were later killed in a car accident. Finally free of her brother, Harriet returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.\n\nHenrik gives Blomkvist the promised information against Wennerström, but it proves to be outdated, and any statutes of limitations have run out. Salander reveals that she has hacked Wennerström's accounts and discovered he is laundering money for various criminal syndicates. She gives Blomkvist evidence of Wennerström's crimes, which Blomkvist publishes in a scathing editorial, ruining Wennerström and bringing Blomkvist to national prominence. Salander, in disguise, travels to Switzerland and removes two billion euros from Wennerström's secret accounts. Wennerström is later murdered in an apparent gangland shooting.\n\nOn her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him and his lover, Erika Berger, being affectionate. She discards the gift and rides away on her motorbike.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes.",

It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as an unhinged stringer who seeks out violent and morbid events late at night in Los Angeles so he can film them and sell the exclusive footage to a local television news station. The supporting cast includes Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed, and Bill Paxton.\n\nGilroy originally wanted to make a film about the life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote the protagonist as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism; a common theme in the film is the symbiotic relationship between unethical journalism and consumer demand. Gyllenhaal served as a producer on the film and played a pivotal role in its creation, becoming involved in choosing members of the crew and watching other actors' audition tapes. Filming was a challenging process, taking place across 80 locations over the course of four weeks.\n\nOpen Road Films utilized viral marketing to promote Nightcrawler, including a fictional video résumé on Craigslist and fake social media profiles for the protagonist. The film premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 15 and was released theatrically on October 31, going on to gross $50.3 million against a budget of $8.5 million[2] and gaining a cult following in the process.[3] It was met with widespread praise, especially Gilroy's screenplay and the performances of Gyllenhaal and Russo. Several critics listed Nightcrawler as one of the best films of 2014 and it received various accolades, including a Best Original Screenplay nomination at the 87th Academy Awards. Gyllenhaal was nominated for the BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and Critics' Choice Movie Award, surprisingly missing in the Best Actor Oscar category.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10]\n\n## Plot\n\nPetty thief Louis \"Lou\" Bloom is caught stealing from a Los Angeles railyard by a security guard. He attacks the guard, steals his watch and leaves with stolen manhole covers, fencing, and other materials. While trying to sell the materials at a scrap yard, Lou asks for a job, but the foreman, who has already been questioned by police looking for the manhole covers, refuses to hire a thief. While driving home in his beat-up Toyota Tercel, Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record two police officers pulling a woman from the burning wreckage. One of the stringers, Joe Loder, explains to Lou that they sell their footage to local news stations.\n\nInspired, Lou steals an expensive bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director, Nina Romina, tells him the station is especially interested in footage of \"graphic\" accidents and violent crime in affluent, predominantly white areas. Lou hires an assistant, Rick, a young homeless man desperate for money. To give his footage more impact, Lou tampers with crime scenes, in one case moving a body to get a better camera angle. As Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car (a red Dodge Challenger).\n\nLou pressures Nina into a date, telling her he knows she is desperate for higher ratings. On their date, he threatens to terminate his business with Nina unless she has sex with him, and it is implied that she acquiesces. Lou turns down an offer to work for Joe, but when Joe beats him to an important plane crash story, Nina demands that Lou get better footage and keep his end of their bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joe's Ford Econoline van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath.\n\nLater, Lou and Rick arrive before the police at the site of a triple-homicide home invasion in Granada Hills. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their Cadillac Escalade and of the victims in the house, and later presents footage to the station with the perpetrators edited out. The news staff frets over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri shows up at Lou's apartment to question him about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the incident, cutting out the parts with the gunmen.\n\nThat night, Lou and Rick track down the driver to his house, staking out the house until he leaves to pick up his partner. Lou wants to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half of the reward money for locating the gunmen, threatening to tell the police about Lou's withholding of evidence. After some back-and-forth, Lou agrees.\n\nWhen the gunmen stop at a restaurant, Lou phones the police, warning them that the suspects are armed. They arrive and exchange gunfire. A police officer is shot and one of the killers is gunned down while the other manages to escape in the Escalade. The police give chase. Lou and Rick follow close behind in the Challenger, filming the chase as it happens, culminating in a long multiple-car collision. After the gunman's Escalade crashes, Lou approaches the vehicle, claiming that the gunman is dead and urging Rick to film him. The gunman is revealed to be alive as he shoots Rick, flees, and is killed by arriving police officers. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who successfully extorted him for withholding evidence, because he knows it will happen again.\n\nNina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually the criminals breaking in to steal cocaine that the homeowners were stashing; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate Lou's footage as evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it and airs it immediately. Lou voluntarily speaks with Detective Frontieri. While being interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates a story about the men in the Escalade following him; Frontieri knows he is lying, but cannot prove it. Later, Lou hires a team of interns to expand his business, saying that he will not ask them to do anything he is unwilling to do himself.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Jake Gyllenhaal as Louis \"Lou\" Bloom[11]\n- Rene Russo as Nina Romina[11]\n- Riz Ahmed as Rick[11]\n- Bill Paxton as Joe Loder[11]\n- Kevin Rahm as Frank Kruse[11]\n- Michael Hyatt as Detective Frontieri[11]\n- Ann Cusack as Linda\n\nCarolyn Gilroy, the daughter of editor John Gilroy and niece of director Dan Gilroy, portrays KWLA 6 employee Jenny.

PopMatters' Jon Lisi believes that, because of Nina's actions, the film specifically targets journalists who exaggerate headlines in order to combat a decline in viewership.[13] Ed Rampell of The Progressive offers similar commentary, stating: \"Nightcrawler contends that ethnic and class biases are used to determine what is, and is not, deemed 'worthy' of news coverage. Local politics and related matters that actually affect viewers' lives get short shrift.\"[14] As much as the film indicts modern journalism, Nightcrawler's director Dan Gilroy noted that his goal was for audiences to realize that by watching sensationalized news stories, they themselves are encouraging unethical journalism.[15] Biron argues that Lou's character in the film is created because of consumer demand, and that he is a \"reflection of the symbiotic relationship between commercial imperatives and audience desire\".[12] Critics Alyssa Rosenberg and Sam Adams argue that Nightcrawler is not so much a critique of journalism, but instead a depiction of Lou's entitlement.[16][17]\n\nThe exact genre of Nightcrawler has been the subject of debate.[18] While most critics agree that the film predominantly features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy,[18][19] drama,[18][20] horror,[20][21] and neo-noir.[22][23] When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: \"I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it's a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and I think I understand the question as there's some really strong elements of drama.\"[18] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: \"Gilroy and I were laughing pretty much the whole movie.\"[24]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nNightcrawler was the directorial debut for Dan Gilroy, who had previously spent several years as a screenwriter.[25]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGilroy conceived the idea for Nightcrawler in 1988, after reading the photo-book Naked City, a collection of photographs taken by American photographer Weegee of 1940s New York City residents at night. Often lewd and sensationalized in content, Weegee would sell these photos to tabloid newspapers. Intrigued by what he described as \"an amazing intersection of art and crime and commerce\", Gilroy wrote a film treatment with a \"Chinatown feel\".[26] He shelved the idea after the release of The Public Eye (1992), which was loosely based on Weegee's life.[27] Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, and noted the predominance of violent crime stories on local news stations. \"I suddenly became aware of and intrigued by the idea that it must be a powerful force for a TV station, when they realize their ratings go through the roof when they show something with the potential for violence, like a police chase\", says Gilroy.[28] Sometime later, he discovered the stringer profession, and considered it to be the modern day equivalent of Weegee.[29] Unaware of any film that focused on the livelihood of stringers, he began writing a screenplay.[30]\n\nGilroy spent several years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements.[22] Eventually, he decided to instead start by designing the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheroes were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; in an attempt to break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story.[31] Several films, including The King of Comedy (1982), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.[30]\n\nTo create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy explored the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge.[32][33] Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals at a certain point in their life, and that they stay that way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost his morality as a result of the job.[34] Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character.[30] Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.[35]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nIn addition to portraying the role of Lou Bloom, Jake Gyllenhaal (pictured) became heavily involved in the pre-production of Nightcrawler, from choosing members of the production crew to watching audition tapes.[27]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOnce the script was finalized, Gilroy knew that he wanted to direct the film. He sent the script to his brother Tony Gilroy, and asked him for advice on directing. His brother described the script as \"absolutely compelling\", and noted every person who read the script afterwards wanted to work on the project, a rarity in the film industry. The production crew included film editor John Gilroy, cinematographer Robert Elswit, and composer James Newton Howard.[27] Gilroy previously met Elswit while working as a screenwriter for The Bourne Legacy (2012); the two formed a partnership, and created a shot-list for Nightcrawler months before filming.[36] The production team needed licensed background footage for the newsroom scenes, and the Raishbrook brothers, three real stringers, offered their footage.[37] The Raishbrook brothers were eventually brought on as technical advisers.[38]\n\nGyllenhaal was Gilroy's first choice for the role of Lou. During pre-production, Gyllenhaal was going to star in another film, but that project fell through, allowing time to meet with Gilroy.[27] The two discussed the script in Atlanta, where Gyllenhaal was filming Prisoners (2013).[39] When Gilroy told Gyllenhaal that he wrote Nightcrawler as a success story, Gyllenhaal became interested in the film. \"This character was beautifully written. The dialogue is pretty extraordinary. Just even the style of the script was an amazing read\", said Gyllenhaal.[40] The two rehearsed the script months before filming began, and Gyllenhaal became heavily involved in production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes.[27][41] While rehearsing the character, Gilroy mentioned how he saw Lou as a coyote, a nocturnal predator who is driven by its never ending hunger.[39] Gyllenhaal took this comment literally, and lost nearly thirty pounds by eating nothing but kale salads and chewing gum, and running fifteen miles every day.[42] Although some of the crew disagreed with this decision, Gilroy was supportive of the weight loss; Gyllenhaal was respectful and did not alter the script, so Gilroy wanted to reciprocate this generosity.[29]\n\nRiz Ahmed was one of seventy-five actors to audition for the role of Rick.[27] Ahmed was attending a friend's wedding in Los Angeles, when his talent agent suggested he meet Gilroy to discuss the film's script. Gilroy told Ahmed that he had seen his previous work; he was not fit for the role, but still allowed him to audition.[43] Within the first minute of his audition tape, Gilroy felt confident in the actor's abilities.[27] To prepare for the role, Ahmed met with homeless people in Skid Row, and researched homeless shelters to \"understand the system\". He found that most of the people dealt with abandonment issues, and attempted to replicate this in Rick's abusive relationship with Lou.[43] Additionally, Gilroy, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed rode with the Raishbrook brothers at night to accurately portray their lifestyle.[44][45]\n\nGilroy specifically wrote the role of Nina for his wife Rene Russo; this was because he felt that Nina could easily be reduced to a \"hard-nosed corporate bitch\", but Russo would bring a sense of vulnerability to the character.[27] Although Russo was unaware of Gilroy's intention while writing the script, she was interested in performing the role, as she had never portrayed a desperate woman in a film.[46] Russo initially struggled with the character, because she never saw herself as the victim. In order to accurately portray the character, Russo had to recall memories of when she crossed moral boundaries in her life as a result of desperation and fear. In contrast to the preparations Gyllenhaal and Ahmed took for their roles, Russo did not consult news directors or journalists, as she believed that Nina could be in any business, and did not want to limit her character to one profession.[47]\n\n### Filming\n\nNightcrawler was filmed on a budget of $8.5 million, most of which was financed by Bold Films.[48][49] Part of the budget came from a $2.3 million California Film Tax Credit, which rewards directors for producing films in California.[49][50] Tony Gilroy noted the budget was extremely low, and should have \"easily cost twice that amount\".[27] To make the most out of the budget, Elswit built \"efficiencies\" into each day of the film schedule, a role that all three Gilroy brothers described as instrumental to the completion of the film.[27] Before the filming for Nightcrawler began, the production crew spent two days location scouting across Los Angeles.[27] Some crew members did not believe there was going to be enough time to film every scene, and that at least 15 pages of the script would have to be cut; Gilroy took these comments as a personal challenge.[27] Principal photography began on October 6, 2013, in Los Angeles and lasted 27 days.[31][49] Filming was a challenging and busy process, as 80 locations were used, and there were many times in which the crew had to move to multiple locations each night.[39] Gilroy remarked that there was never a day that filming was not completed minutes before sunrise.[27]\n\nOne of the goals while filming Nightcrawler was to portray Los Angeles as having \"an untamed spirit, a wildness, a timelessness,\nabout it\", and to not let the visuals dictate the dark tone of the script. Gilroy believes that, in contrast to the desaturated, man-made feel that the city is often depicted with, Los Angeles is a \"landscape of primal struggle and survival\".[36] Gyllenhaal's animalistic approach to the script influenced this belief, and the idea was to film Nightcrawler like a wildlife documentary.[35] To achieve this goal, Elswit used wide-angle lens, depth of field, and avoided soft focus to bring a sense of landscape.[27][36]\n\n### Music\n\nJames Newton Howard composed the score for Nightcrawler. Unlike the large and cinematic scores that had previously defined his career, Howard composed moody electronica pieces for Nightcrawler, heavily influenced by 1980s synth.[51] Howard initially struggled writing a score that fit both the overall atmosphere of the film and Gilroy's expectations.[52] Instead of using what Consequence of Sound described as \"the expected 10 strings and a nightmarish score\", Gilroy wanted more uplifting and subversive music.[53] The goal was for the audience to believe that the music is actually playing inside Lou's mind. For example, in the scene when Lou moves a dead body to get a better angle, the music sounds triumphant instead of dark, which is meant to convey how excited Lou is about the shot. Howard describes this as \"an anthem of potential for his tremendous success\".[52] For shots of Los Angeles, Howard used a subtle electronic sound, while shots with Lou used a more orchestral, clarinet-driven sound. He believed that Lou could go through difficult situations easily and with a certain intelligence, and that orchestral music would best suit Lou.[52]\n\n## Marketing\n\nAccording to Open Road Films CEO Tom Ortenberg, the company attempted to market Nightcrawler to both mainstream audiences and art house critics. \"We had material that portrayed the picture as the commercial property that it is, but not while abandoning its indie roots\", says Ortenberg.[54] The first trailer was released on July 23,[55] while a red band trailer was released on October 24.[56] In addition to typical trailers, Nightcrawler also used some unusual viral marketing strategies. On July 19, a fictional video résumé for Lou was posted on Craigslist. In the video, Lou discusses his benefits for potential employers.[57] A few months later, LinkedIn and Twitter profiles were created for Lou. These profiles purport the video production business that Lou runs in the film to be real, and endorse Lou's management and strategic planning skills.[17]\n\n## Release\n\nAn unfinished version of Nightcrawler was screened on May 16, at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival; the film sparked a bidding war between several distribution companies, including A24, Focus Features, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Open Road Films, and The Weinstein Company.[58] Open Road Films acquired the distribution rights in the United States for around $4.5 million.[59] Nightcrawler had its world premiere on September 5, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.[60] It also screened at several other film festivals, including the Atlantic Film Festival,[61] Fantastic Fest,[62] and the Rome Film Festival.[63] The film was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on October 17, but Open Road Films moved the release to October 31, to avoid competition with several bigger-budget films like Fury, Birdman, Dracula Untold, and The Book of Life.[64]\n\n### Home media\n\nNightcrawler was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 10, 2015,[65] courtesy of Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.[66] Special features on the Blu-ray release include an audio commentary in which the three Gilroy brothers discuss the film's production, and a five-minute making-of video with behind-the-scenes shots and interviews.[66] In its first week of DVD and Blu-ray release, Nightcrawler sold 67,132 units, and grossed $1.1 million. In its second week, the film dropped sixty-seven percent in sales, and made $371,442, for an overall total of $1.5 million.[67]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nIn North America, Nightcrawler earned $500,000 from early screenings, and after opening to 2,766 theaters, grossed $3.2 million on its first day of release.[54][68] It finished its opening weekend with $10.9 million;[69] journalists attributed the low sales to Halloween festivities.[68][69] In its second weekend, Nightcrawler dropped forty-nine percent in sales, and grossed $5.4 million.[70] After grossing $28.8 million by December, Nightcrawler reentered North American theaters due to several nominations during the 2014 film awards season.[71] The film eventually finished with $32.4 million in North America.[48]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Nightcrawler opened to £1 million ($1.33 million), and grossed an additional £545,221 ($725,563) in its second weekend.[72][73] The film would eventually earn $18 million in international territories, and when combined with its North American sales, earned $50.3 million.[48] Despite its low production budget, Ortenberg believes that Nightcrawler was able to succeed at the box office by word-of-mouth marketing. \"College kids, cinephiles, mainstream moviegoers across the country as well as critics and bloggers started taking possession of Nightcrawler as their own and championed it. It became a cause for people to promote it and get it seen\", says Ortenberg.[54]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe website Rotten Tomatoes aggregated an approval rating of 95% for the film based on 279 reviews and an average rating of 8.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.\"[74] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[75] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.[76]\n\nReviewers call Gyllenhaal's character a \"charming sociopath\" and his performance \"a bravura, career-changing tour-de-force\".[77][78] Film critic Christy Lemire called Gyllenhaal's performance \"supremely creepy\" and praised the film's themes and messages.[79] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic compared Gyllenhaal to a young Robert De Niro and his performances in the films Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy, feeling Gyllenhaal's character harbored traits shared by De Niro's characters in the two films. Orr called Gyllenhaal \"tremendous\" in the role and stated that the actor was learning to \"channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once\". He also declared the role as Gyllenhaal's \"best performance to date\".[80] Ben Sachs of the Chicago Reader highlighted Gilroy's direction, and how he was able to command an \"uncommon assurance\" from the cast and crew, despite being a first time director.[81] Conversely, Richard Roeper felt that Gyllenhaal's performance was merely good, and that it did not enter \"new dramatic territory\". He also found that Russo's character eventually becomes a caricature.[82]\n\nKeith Uhlich of The A.V. Club named Nightcrawler the eighth-best film of 2014.[83] Its screenplay was ranked the ninth best of the 2010s in WhatCulture: \"This feverous script succeeds because it contains one of modern cinema's greatest character [sic], Lou Bloom- macabre, ruthless, brazenly tranquil yet simmering with a latent violence [...] Gilroy opts for one-word sentences which zip across the page like Bloom's Dodge Challenger tearing down the interstate for the next car crash or burn victim.\" The writer also argued that the trajectory of the main character \"plays to our guilt over our voyeurism- we consume the footage which men like Bloom provide, we allow the likes of him to rise in society\".[84]\n\nIn 2024, Paste Magazine ranked the character 5th among \"the best portrayals of cinematic sociopaths\".[85]\n\n### Top ten lists\n\nNightcrawler was listed on many critics' top ten lists.[86]\n\n- 1st – Den of Geek\n- 2nd – Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York\n- 3rd – Matt Goldberg, Collider.com\n- 3rd – Erik Davis, Movies.com\n- 3rd – Yahoo!

At the 87th Academy Awards, Gilroy was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[87] The film received an additional four nominations at the 68th British Academy Film Awards, three nominations at the 20th Critics' Choice Awards, one nomination at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and one nomination at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, but did not win any of them.[88][89][90][91] It did, however, win Best Film at the 19th San Diego Film Critics Society Awards.\n\nGyllenhaal was nominated for the BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and Critics' Choice Movie Award, surprisingly missing in the Best Actor Oscar category.[92][93][94][95][96][97][98]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films featuring psychopaths and sociopaths\n\n- Medium Cool\n- Mukundan Unni Associates\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Nightcrawler\".

Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, Incendies stars Lubna Azabal, Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin, Maxim Gaudette, and Rémy Girard.\n\nThe story concerns Canadian twins who travel to their mother's native country in the Levant to uncover her hidden past amidst a bloody civil war. While the country is unnamed, the events in the film are heavily influenced by the Lebanese Civil War and particularly the story of the prisoner Souha Bechara. The film was shot mainly in Montreal, with fifteen days spent in Jordan.\n\nIt premiered at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals in September 2010, and was released in Quebec on 17 September 2010. It met with critical acclaim in Canada and abroad and won numerous awards.\n\nIn 2011, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Incendies also won eight Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.\n\n## Plot\n\nFollowing the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will refers to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\n\nA series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her in an honor killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage.\n\nWhile Nawal is at university in Daresh, civil war and war crimes break out, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Nawal leaves town to try to find her son and boards a bus full of Muslim refugees. Christian Nationalists shoot the driver and fire into the bus full of passengers, only missing Nawal and a mother with her child. As the Nationalists prepare to set the bus on fire, the survivors try to escape towards the back of the bus. Nawal shows her crucifix and tells the Nationalists that she is Christian. She attempts to save a child by claiming her as her own, but the child runs back towards the burning bus, calling for her mother, and is unceremoniously shot. Nawal finds her way back to town and joins the Muslim fighters. She tutors the son of a nationalist leader, eventually earning enough trust to smuggle in a gun to shoot the leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and sings through the screams of other prisoners, earning her the nickname \"The Woman Who Sings\". To attempt to break her, she is raped by torturer Abou Tarek who leaves her saying, \"Sing now.\" She consequently gives birth to the twins.\n\nAfter traveling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May (the month he was born in) and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool and saw both the tattoo (proving him as her son) and his face (proving him as her rapist). The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke, which led to her decline and untimely death at age 60.\n\nThe twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love. Horrified at the truth, Nihad tries to chase after the twins, but they are gone.\n\nNawal gets her gravestone.  Sometime later, Nihad visits it.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan\n- Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin as Jeanne \"Janaan\" Marwan\n- Maxim Gaudette as Simon \"Sarwan\" Marwan\n- Rémy Girard as Jean Lebel\n- Abdelghafour Elaaziz as Abou Tarek/Nihad \"Nihad de Mai\" Harmanni\n- Allen Altman as Notary Maddad\n- Mohamed Majd as Chamseddine\n- Nabil Sawalha as Fahim\n- Baya Belal as Maika\n- Bader Alami as Nicolas\n- Karim Babin as Chamseddine's guard\n- Anthony Ecclissi as Lifeguard\n- Joyce Raie as Student Journalist\n- Yousef Shweihat as Sharif\n- Celine Soulier as French Journalist\n- Mher Karakashian as Chamseddine's assistant\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve adapted Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nParts of the story were based on the life of Souha Bechara.[5][6][7] The story is based on events that happened during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous.[8][9]\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve first saw Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies at Théâtre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 2004, commenting \"I had this strong intuition that I was in front of a masterpiece\".[9] Villeneuve acknowledged unfamiliarity with Arab culture, but was drawn to Incendies as \"a modern story with a sort of Greek tragedy element\".[10] In adapting the screenplay, Villeneuve, while keeping the story structure and characters, replaced \"all\" the dialogue, even envisioning a silent film, abandoning the idea due to expense.[9] He showed Mouawad some completed scenes to convince the initially reluctant playwright to grant permission for the film.[9] Villeneuve spent five years working on the screenplay, in between directing two films.[11] Mouawad later praised the film as \"brilliantly elegant\" and gave Villeneuve full credit.[12] The project had a budget of $6.5 million,[3] and received funding from Telefilm Canada.[13]\n\n### Casting\n\nMoroccan-Belgian actress Lubna Azabal was cast as Nawal after an extensive search, and won Best Actress at Belgium's Magritte Awards and Canada's Genie Awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the part of Nawal, Villeneuve said he conducted an extensive search for actresses across Canada.[11] He considered casting the main character to be the most challenging, and at one point contemplated using two or three actresses to play the character since the story spans four decades.[14] He finally met Lubna Azabal, a Belgian actress of Moroccan—Spanish descent[15] in Paris, intrigued by her \"expressive and eloquent\" face in Paradise Now (2005).[11] Although she was 30, Villeneuve thought she appeared 18 and could play the part throughout the entire film, using makeup.[14]\n\nVilleneuve selected Canadian actress Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin to play Jeanne, saying the role required listening skills and Désormeaux-Poulin is \"a very generous actress\".[11] Before Incendies, Désormeaux-Poulin was mainly known for \"light fare\".[16] Montreal actor Allen Altman, who played a notary, worked with a dialect coach for hours to develop a blend of the French and Arab accents before auditioning.[17] While shooting in Jordan, to research his role, actor Maxim Gaudette toured a Palestinian refugee camp near Amman.[18]\n\n### Filming\n\nSome of the 15 days of filming in Jordan was done in Amman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film was shot in Montreal and Jordan.[17] The film took 40 days to shoot, of which 15 were spent in Jordan, with Villeneuve aiming to film no scene without being sure it would not be cut.[3]\n\nFor the scenes filmed in Jordan, Villeneuve used a Lebanese and Iraqi crew, though he feared the war scenes would be too reminiscent of bad experiences for them. However, he said the Arab crew members felt \"It's important that those sorts of stories are on the screen\".[19] Some of the filming in Jordan took place in the capital of Amman.[1] To recreate Beirut, art director André-Line Beauparlant built up rock and debris on a street in Amman.[18]\n\n### Music\n\nTwo tracks by British band Radiohead from their album Amnesiac, \"You and Whose Army?\" and \"Like Spinning Plates\", were used in the film.[20] The music was considered so notable and integral to the film that the music was mentioned in many reviews.[21][22][23][24] Film critic David Ehrlich wrote that \"Incendies exploits Radiohead tracks for the multiplicity of their meaning, empowering the image by dislocating viewers from it\". Villeneuve said that he had written \"You and Whose Army?\" into the script from the beginning, as it was intended to make it \"clear that [the film] will be a westerner's point of view about this world\".[25] One music reviewer gave it first place in their \"Top Ten Music Moments in Film\".[26]\n\n## Release\n\nIncendies was officially selected to play in the 67th Venice International Film Festival, 2010 Telluride Film Festival, 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, 2011 Sundance Film Festival and 2011 New Directors/New Films Festival.[27] The film opened in Toronto and Vancouver in January 2011.[9]\n\nIn the United States, the film was distributed by Sony Pictures Classics.[10] When the film was screened in Beirut in March 2011, Villeneuve claimed \"a lot of people said to me that we should show this film to their children, to show them what they had been through\".[19]\n\nIn 2023, Telefilm Canada announced that the film was one of 23 titles that will be digitally restored under its new Canadian Cinema Reignited program to preserve classic Canadian films.[28]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nIn Canada, the film passed the $1 million mark at the box office by October 2010.[29] By the end of April 2011, the film grossed $4.7 million.[30] In Quebec theatres alone, Incendies made $3 million.[3] It was considered a success in the country.[19]\n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, the film completed its theatrical run on 29 September 2011, after making $2,071,334 in the U.S.[31] According to The Numbers, the film grossed $6,857,096 in North America and $9,181,247 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,038,343.[4]\n\n### Critical response\n\nIncendies received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% positive reviews based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.\"[32] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 80 out 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[33]\n\nThe film enjoyed a positive reception in its country and province. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal gave it 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, \"Villeneuve has done his best work yet here\".[34] The Montreal Gazette's Brendan Kelly gave the film five stars and called it a \"masterwork\".[35]  Marc Cassivi of La Presse claimed the film transcended the play.[36] Peter Howell, writing for The Toronto Star, gave the film four stars, called it \"a commanding film of multiple revelations\", and the best of 2010, and praised Lubna Azabal as \"first amongst equals\".[37] However, Martin Morrow of CBC News was unimpressed, saying, \"Villeneuve's screen adaptation strips away all this finely textured flesh and leaves only the bare bones\".[38] University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote that the film, along with Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012), represent a break in the Cinema of Quebec from focus on local history to global concerns, with Incendies adding Oedipal themes.[39] Authors Gada Mahrouse,  Chantal Maillé and Daniel Salée wrote McCraw and Déry's films, Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar and Inch'Allah, depict Quebec as part of the global village and as accepting minorities, particularly Middle Easterners or \"Muslim Others\".[40]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying \"it wants to be much more than a thriller and succeeds in demonstrating how senseless and futile it is to hate others because of their religion\", and Azabal \"is never less than compelling\".[41] He later selected the film as his favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film,[42] though it lost to In a Better World from Denmark. Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars, referring to it as \"tough, spellbinding\".[43] Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film three and a half stars, praising a bus scene as harrowing but saying the climax is \"a plot twist that feels like one coincidence too far\", that \"leaves the audience doing math on their fingers rather than reeling in shock\".[44] Incendies was named by Stephen Holden of The New York Times as one of the 10 best films of 2011.[45] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it Villeneuve's \"best-realized work yet\".[46] A number of reviews complimented use of the song \"You and Whose Army?\" by Radiohead.[11][38][47][48] Criticisms have included charges of melodrama and orientalism.[49]\n\n### Accolades\n\nOn 22 September 2010, Incendies was chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.[50] It made the shortlist on 19 January 2011, one of nine films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on 25 January 2011.[51][52]\n\nIt won eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actress for Azabal and Best Director for Villeneuve.[53] Along with Incendies, Villeneuve won the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award in 2009 for the film Polytechnique, the first Canadian filmmaker to win it twice in a row.[54]  Incendies also won the Prix Jutra for Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actress (Azabal), Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Sound.\n\nIt is also the only film to date to have won both the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film and the Vancouver International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film.[55]\n\n| Award

Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, Incendies stars Lubna Azabal, Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin, Maxim Gaudette, and Rémy Girard.\n\n    The story concerns Canadian twins who travel to their mother's native country in the Levant to uncover her hidden past amidst a bloody civil war. While the country is unnamed, the events in the film are heavily influenced by the Lebanese Civil War and particularly the story of the prisoner Souha Bechara. The film was shot mainly in Montreal, with fifteen days spent in Jordan.\n\n    It premiered at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals in September 2010, and was released in Quebec on <ReleaseYear>17 September 2010</ReleaseYear>. It met with critical acclaim in Canada and abroad and won numerous awards.\n\n    In <ReleaseYear>2011</ReleaseYear>, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Incendies also won eight Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    <Plot>\n        Following the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will refers to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit.\n\n        A series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her in an honor killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage.\n\n        While Nawal is at university in Daresh, civil war and war crimes break out, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Nawal leaves town to try to find her son and boards a bus full of Muslim refugees. Christian Nationalists shoot the driver and fire into the bus full of passengers, only missing Nawal and a mother with her child. As the Nationalists prepare to set the bus on fire, the survivors try to escape towards the back of the bus. Nawal shows her crucifix and tells the Nationalists that she is Christian. She attempts to save a child by claiming her as her own, but the child runs back towards the burning bus, calling for her mother, and is unceremoniously shot. Nawal finds her way back to town and joins the Muslim fighters. She tutors the son of a nationalist leader, eventually earning enough trust to smuggle in a gun to shoot the leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and sings through the screams of other prisoners, earning her the nickname \"The Woman Who Sings\". To attempt to break her, she is raped by torturer Abou Tarek who leaves her saying, \"Sing now.\" She consequently gives birth to the twins.\n\n        After traveling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May (the month he was born in) and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool and saw both the tattoo (proving him as her son) and his face (proving him as her rapist). The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke, which led to her decline and untimely death at age 60.\n\n        The twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love. Horrified at the truth, Nihad tries to chase after the twins, but they are gone.\n\n        Nawal gets her gravestone. Sometime later, Nihad visits it.\n    </Plot>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    <Cast>\n        - Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan\n        - Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin as Jeanne \"Janaan\" Marwan\n        - Maxim Gaudette as Simon \"Sarwan\" Marwan\n        - Rémy Girard as Jean Lebel\n        - Abdelghafour Elaaziz as Abou Tarek/Nihad \"Nihad de Mai\" Harmanni\n        - Allen Altman as Notary Maddad\n        - Mohamed Majd as Chamseddine\n        - Nabil Sawalha as Fahim\n        - Baya Belal as Maika\n        - Bader Alami as Nicolas\n        - Karim Babin as Chamseddine's guard\n        - Anthony Ecclissi as Lifeguard\n        - Joyce Raie as Student Journalist\n        - Yousef Shweihat as Sharif\n        - Celine Soulier as French Journalist\n        - Mher Karakashian as Chamseddine's assistant\n    </Cast>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    <Production>\n        <Development>\n            Director <Director>Denis Villeneuve</Director> adapted Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004.\n\n            Parts of the story were based on the life of Souha Bechara. The story is based on events that happened during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous.\n\n            Director <Director>Denis Villeneuve</Director> first saw Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies at Théâtre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 2004, commenting \"I had this strong intuition that I was in front of a masterpiece\". Villeneuve acknowledged unfamiliarity with Arab culture, but was drawn to Incendies as \"a modern story with a sort of Greek tragedy element\". In adapting the screenplay, Villeneuve, while keeping the story structure and characters, replaced \"all\" the dialogue, even envisioning a silent film, abandoning the idea due to expense. He showed Mouawad some completed scenes to convince the initially reluctant playwright to grant permission for the film. Villeneuve spent five years working on the screenplay, in between directing two films. Mouawad later praised the film as \"brilliantly elegant\" and gave Villeneuve full credit. The project had a budget of $6.5 million, and received funding from Telefilm Canada.\n        </Development>\n    </Production>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    <Reception>\n        <BoxOffice>\n            In Canada, the film passed the $1 million mark at the box office by October 2010. By the end of April 2011, the film grossed $4.7 million. In Quebec theatres alone, Incendies made $3 million. It was considered a success in the country.\n\n            According to Box Office Mojo, the film completed its theatrical run on 29 September 2011, after making $2,071,334 in the U.S. According to The Numbers, the film grossed $6,857,096 in North America and $9,181,247 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,038,343.\n        </BoxOffice>\n        <CriticalResponse>\n            Incendies received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% positive reviews based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 80 out 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n            The film enjoyed a positive reception in its country and province. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal gave it 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, \"Villeneuve has done his best work yet here\". The Montreal Gazette's Brendan Kelly gave the film five stars and called it a \"masterwork\". Marc Cassivi of La Presse claimed the film transcended the play. Peter Howell, writing for The Toronto Star, gave the film four stars, called it \"a commanding film of multiple revelations\", and the best of 2010, and praised Lubna Azabal as \"first amongst equals\". However, Martin Morrow of CBC News was unimpressed, saying, \"Villeneuve's screen adaptation strips away all this finely textured flesh and leaves only the bare bones\". University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote that the film, along with Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012), represent a break in the Cinema of Quebec from focus on local history to global concerns, with Incendies adding Oedipal themes. Authors Gada Mahrouse, Chantal Maillé and Daniel Salée wrote McCraw and Déry's films, Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar and Inch'Allah, depict Quebec as part of the global village and as accepting minorities, particularly Middle Easterners or \"Muslim Others\".\n\n            Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying \"it wants to be much more than a thriller and succeeds in demonstrating how senseless and futile it is to hate others because of their religion\", and Azabal \"is never less than compelling\". He later selected the film as his favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it lost to In a Better World from Denmark. Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars, referring to it as \"tough, spellbinding\". Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film three and a half stars, praising a bus scene as harrowing but saying the climax is \"a plot twist that feels like one coincidence too far\", that \"leaves the audience doing math on their fingers rather than reeling in shock\". Incendies was named by Stephen Holden of The New York Times as one of the 10 best films of 2011. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it Villeneuve's \"best-realized work yet\". A number of reviews complimented use of the song \"You and Whose Army?\" by Radiohead. Criticisms have included charges of melodrama and orientalism.\n        </CriticalResponse>\n    </Reception>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n<AdditionalInformation>\n    <Accolades>\n        On 22 September 2010, Incendies was chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. It made the shortlist on 19 January 2011, one of nine films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on 25 January 2011.\n\n        It won eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actress for Azabal and Best Director for Villeneuve. Along with Incendies, Villeneuve won the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award in 2009 for the film Polytechnique, the first Canadian filmmaker to win it twice in a row. Incendies also won the Prix Jutra for Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actress (Azabal), Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Sound.\n\n        It is also the only film to date to have won both the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film and the Vancouver International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film.\n    </Accolades>\n</AdditionalInformation>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes.

                        "Development": "Director Denis Villeneuve adapted Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004. Parts of the story were based on the life of Souha Bechara. The story is based on events that happened during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous. Director Denis Villeneuve first saw Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies at Théâtre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 2004, commenting 'I had this strong intuition that I was in front of a masterpiece'. Villeneuve acknowledged unfamiliarity with Arab culture, but was drawn to Incendies as 'a modern story with a sort of Greek tragedy element'. In adapting the screenplay, Villeneuve, while keeping the story structure and characters, replaced 'all' the dialogue, even envisioning a silent film, abandoning the idea due to expense. He showed Mouawad some completed scenes to convince the initially reluctant playwright to grant permission for the film. Villeneuve spent five years working on the screenplay, in between directing two films. Mouawad later praised the film as 'brilliantly elegant' and gave Villeneuve full credit. The project had a budget of $6.5 million, and received funding from Telefilm Canada."

                    "Reception": {
                        "BoxOffice": "In Canada, the film passed the $1 million mark at the box office by October 2010. By the end of April 2011, the film grossed $4.7 million. In Quebec theatres alone, Incendies made $3 million. It was considered a success in the country. According to Box Office Mojo, the film completed its theatrical run on 29 September 2011, after making $2,071,334 in the U.S. According to The Numbers, the film grossed $6,857,096 in North America and $9,181,247 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,038,343.",
                        "CriticalResponse": "Incendies received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% positive reviews based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, 'It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 80 out 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'. The film enjoyed a positive reception in its country and province. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal gave it 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, 'Villeneuve has done his best work yet here'. The Montreal Gazette's Brendan Kelly gave the film five stars and called it a 'masterwork'. Marc Cassivi of La Presse claimed the film transcended the play. Peter Howell, writing for The Toronto Star, gave the film four stars, called it 'a commanding film of multiple revelations', and the best of 2010, and praised Lubna Azabal as 'first amongst equals'. However, Martin Morrow of CBC News was unimpressed, saying, 'Villeneuve's screen adaptation strips away all this finely textured flesh and leaves only the bare bones'. University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote that the film, along with Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012), represent a break in the Cinema of Quebec from focus on local history to global concerns, with Incendies adding Oedipal themes. Authors Gada Mahrouse, Chantal Maillé and Daniel Salée wrote McCraw and Déry's films, Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar and Inch'Allah, depict Quebec as part of the global village and as accepting minorities, particularly Middle Easterners or 'Muslim Others'. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying 'it wants to be much more than a thriller and succeeds in demonstrating how senseless and futile it is to hate others because of their religion', and Azabal 'is never less than compelling'. He later selected the film as his favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it lost to In a Better World from Denmark. Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars, referring to it as 'tough, spellbinding'. Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film three and a half stars, praising a bus scene as harrowing but saying the climax is 'a plot twist that feels like one coincidence too far', that 'leaves the audience doing math on their fingers rather than reeling in shock'. Incendies was named by Stephen Holden of The New York Times as one of the 10 best films of 2011. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it Villeneuve's 'best-realized work yet'. A number of reviews complimented use of the song 'You and Whose Army?' by Radiohead. Criticisms have included charges of melodrama and orientalism."
                    },
                    "Accolades": "On 22 September 2010, Incendies was chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. It made the shortlist on 19 January 2011, one of nine films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on 25 January 2011. It won eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actress for Azabal and Best Director for Villeneuve. Along with Incendies, Villeneuve won the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award in 2009 for the film Polytechnique, the first Canadian filmmaker to win it twice in a row. Incendies also won the Prix Jutra for Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actress (Azabal), Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Sound. It is also the only film to date to have won both the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film and the Vancouver International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film."

The screenplay, written by Bráulio Mantovani, is adapted from the 1997 novel by Paulo Lins, though the plot is also loosely based on real events. The film portrays the rise of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro between the late 1960s and early 1980s, culminating in a war between drug dealer Li'l Zé and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned. Its tagline is, \"If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you.\"\n\nThe film features a cast including Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino, Jonathan and Phellipe Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Daniel Zettel, Seu Jorge, and the film debut of Alice Braga. Most of the actors were actual residents of favelas such as Vidigal and Cidade de Deus itself.\n\nCity of God received widespread critical acclaim and earned four nominations at the 76th Academy Awards: Best Cinematography (César Charlone), Best Director (Meirelles), Best Film Editing (Daniel Rezende), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Mantovani). At the previous 75th Academy Awards, it was Brazil's submission for Best Foreign Language Film but was not selected as a finalist. In 2015, the Brazilian Film Critics Association (Abraccine) ranked City of God 8th on its list of the 100 greatest Brazilian films.[8]\n\nFollowing the success of City of God, Meirelles and Lund created the City of Men TV series and its 2007 film adaptation. Both projects share some actors (notably leads Silva and Darlan Cunha) and the same setting as City of God.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film opens in medias res in the 1980s within the titular Rio de Janeiro favela. A gang led by the ruthless drug lord Li'l Zé (formerly Li'l Dice) chases a runaway chicken. The bird halts between the gang and the film’s narrator, Rocket (Buscapé), a young aspiring photographer. This tense standoff frames the nonlinear narrative, which chronicles the favela’s descent into violence over two decades.\n\n### 1960s: The rise of the Tender Trio\n\nThe story flashes back to the 1960s, when the Cidade de Deus is a fledgling housing project plagued by poverty. Rocket, then a child, observes his older brother Goose (Marreco) and two friends—Shaggy (Cabeleira) and Clipper (Alicate)—known as the \"Tender Trio.\" These amateur thieves rob gas trucks and businesses, sharing proceeds with residents who shield them from police. Their cautious approach contrasts with Li'l Dice, an ambitious preteen who idolizes the trio.\n\nLi'l Dice manipulates the Tender Trio into raiding a motel, insisting they rob wealthy guests. The trio agrees but forbids killing. During the heist, Li'l Dice, left as a lookout, fabricates a police arrival, prompting the gang to flee. He then massacres the motel occupants, drawing intense police scrutiny. The trio disbands: Clipper joins a church, Shaggy dies in a police shootout, and Goose is murdered by Li'l Dice after stealing his loot. Witnessing this, Benny (Bené), Shaggy’s brother and Li'l Dice’s friend, becomes complicit in the betrayal.\n\n### 1970s: Li'l Zé’s reign and Rocket’s struggles\n\nBy the 1970s, the favela morphs into a violent drug hub. Li'l Dice, now \"Li'l Zé,\" dominates the trade with Benny, eliminating rivals except Carrot, Benny’s childhood friend. Rocket, now a teenager, navigates the chaos, pursuing photography and a romance with Angélica. His life intersects with Li'l Zé when he visits a drug den during a raid; recognizing Rocket as Goose’s brother, Benny spares him.\n\nLi'l Zé’s empire faces threats from the \"Runts,\" preteen thieves disrupting Carrot’s territory. When Carrot refuses to act, Li'l Zé forces a Runt named Steak n’ Fries to kill a peer, cementing his tyranny. Meanwhile, Rocket’s attempts at honest work fail after the Runts loot his supermarket job. He nearly turns to crime but is dissuaded by Knockout Ned (Mané Galinha), a principled bus clerk and ex-Army sharpshooter.\n\nBenny, seeking escape, plans to leave with Angélica. At his farewell party, a conflict erupts when Li'l Zé confronts Benny over abandoning him. Blacky, a disgruntled dealer who had his turf stolen by Zé in an earlier raid, accidentally kills Benny during a botched assassination attempt. Carrot, fearing retaliation, kills Blacky. Grief-stricken, Li'l Zé targets Carrot but first assaults Ned and rapes his girlfriend. Ned retaliates by allying with Carrot, sparking a gang war.\n\n### 1981: Escalation and resolution\n\nA year later, the war rages on. Ned, now a media figure, is betrayed by his own vengeance, killing a guard during a bank robbery. Rocket, now working for Jornal do Brasil, photographs the chaos. After Li'l Zé demands photos of his gang, Rocket’s images are accidentally published without consent. While he believes that this will endanger his life and forbid him from returning to the favela, unbeknownst to him, it is revealed that Li'l Zé was trying to gain the media spotlight anyway and approves of the photos. Marina, the journalist who published the photos, offers for Rocket to spend a night at hers as a form of apology, finally losing his virginity to her in the process.\n\nThe narrative returns to the opening chicken chase. Amid a police standoff, Carrot’s gang ambushes Li'l Zé. Ned kills Li'l Zé’s ally Tiago but is slain by Otto, the son of the bank guard who witnessed his murder at the hands of Ned. Police arrest Li'l Zé and Carrot but release the former after bribes. The Runts, aspiring to power and seeking revenge for their murdered comrade, execute Li'l Zé. Rocket photographs the corrupt exchange but opts to publish Li'l Zé’s corpse, securing his journalism career over exposing police corruption.\n\nThe film concludes with the Runts plotting their takeover, perpetuating the cycle of violence. Rocket’s choice underscores his role as an observer, capturing the favela’s brutal reality while seeking escape through his art.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Alexandre Rodrigues as Rocket:\nThe narrator, who dreams of becoming a photographer. His real name is Wilson Rodrigues.\n- Leandro Firmino as Li'l Zé/Li'l Dice:\nA power-hungry sociopath, who takes sadistic pleasure in killing. \"Dado\" is a common nickname for Eduardo and means \"dice\", and \"inho\" a diminutive suffix in Portuguese. As an adult, he is given the name Zé Pequeno in a Candomblé ceremony, which may be unrelated to his actual name and more to his short stature. Zé is a nickname for José, while pequeno means \"little\". Douglas Silva portrays Li'l Dice as a child.\n- Phellipe Haagensen as Benny:\nZé's longtime partner in crime, he is a friendly City of God drug dealer who fancies himself a sort of Robin Hood, and eventually wants to lead an honest life. Michel Gomes portrays Benny as a child.\n- Matheus Nachtergaele as Carrot:\nA drug dealer who is friendly with Benny but is constantly threatened by Zé.\n- Seu Jorge as Mané Galinha [pt]:\n A handsome, charismatic gentleman. As a former veteran, he is an excellent shot and can shoot better than most of the \"soldiers\". His name was changed for the English subtitles because in English, \"chicken\" is a term for a coward (in Brazil it denotes womanizing tendencies and popularity among women). \"Mané\" is a nickname for Manuel, but also denotes an individual not intellectually gifted.\n- Jonathan Haagensen as Shaggy:\nOlder brother of Benny and the leader of the Tender Trio (\"Trio Ternura\"), a group of thieves who share their profits with the population of the City of God.\n- Roberta Rodrigues as Berenice:\nShaggy's girlfriend, who convinces him to leave the favela and his criminal past.\n- Renato de Souza as Goose:\nOne of the Tender Trio, and Rocket's brother. He sleeps with a bartender's wife and gets kicked out by his father when the police arrive, he is killed by Li'l Dice later that day.\n- Jefechander Suplino as Clipper:\nOne of the Tender Trio. He later gives up crime to join the Church.\n- Edson Oliveira as Stringy:\nChildhood friend of Rocket.

According to Meirelles, amateur actors were used for two reasons: the lack of available professional black actors, and the desire for authenticity. Meirelles explained: \"Today I can open a casting call and have 500 black actors, but just ten years ago this possibility did not exist. In Brazil, there were three or four young black actors and at the same time I felt that actors from the middle class could not make the film. I needed authenticity.\"[11]\n\nBeginning around 2000, about a hundred children and young people were hand-picked and placed into an \"actors' workshop\" for several months. In contrast to more traditional methods (e.g. studying theatre and rehearsing), it focused on simulating authentic street war scenes, such as a hold-up, scuffle, and shoot-out. Much came from improvisation, as it was thought better to create an authentic, gritty atmosphere. This way, the inexperienced cast soon learned to move and act naturally. After filming, the crew could not leave the cast to return to their old lives in the favelas. Assistance groups were set up to help those involved in the production to build more promising futures.[12]: 135–139\n\nMeirelles went into the film with the intention of staying true to the \"casual nature\" of the violence in the novel by Lins. Critic Jean Oppenheimer wrote on the production of the film saying that: \"A second guiding principle was to avoid glamorising the violence\" and that \"many of the killings are either shown indistinctly or kept out of frame.\"[12]: 26–32\n\nBecause the real Cidade de Deus favela was in the middle of a conflict, a large majority of the film was shot in Cidade Alta, a different favela within Rio. During the production, slumlords did not allow for the production company to have their own security, so local security guards were hired for the safety of the set.[13]\n\nLund and Meirelles filmed the short film Golden Gate as a test run[10] while casting for City of God was in the initial stages.[14]\n\n## Music\n\nThe score to the film composed by Antonio Pinto and Ed Córtes. It was followed by two remix albums. Songs from the film:\n\n- \"Alvorada\" (Cartola / Carlos Cachaça / Herminio B.

Kupka) – Tower of Power\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.[15] The film could not be part of the official selection because Walter Salles, one of the executive producers, was in the festival jury.[16] In Brazil, City of God garnered the largest audience for a domestic film in 2002, with over 3.1 million tickets sold, and a gross of R$18.6 million ($10.3 million).[17] The film grossed over $7.5 million in the U.S. and over US$30.5 million worldwide.[18]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, City of God has an approval rating of 91% based on reviews from 165 critics, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads, \"City of God offers a shocking and disturbing—but always compelling—look at life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.\"[19] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 79 out of 100 based on 33 critic reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[20]\n\nColin Kennedy from Empire awarded the film a full 5 out of 5 stars, comparing it favorably to Goodfellas and writing in his review, \"At once a laboratory for cinema technique and a victory for raw heart, this is a snot-nosed, blood-stained masterpiece. If you see even one or two better movies this year, you will be very lucky indeed.\"[21] In 2008, the magazine chose City of God as the 177th best film of all time.[22]\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert awarded the film 4 stars out of 4, writing in his review, \"City of God churns with furious energy as it plunges into the story of the slum gangs of Rio de Janeiro. Breathtaking and terrifying, urgently involved with its characters, it announces a new director of great gifts and passions: Fernando Meirelles. Remember the name.\"[23][24]\n\nFilmmaker Robert Altman stated, \"I don't know how Fernando Meirelles made City Of God. It's so courageous, so truthful. I think it's the best picture I've ever seen\".[25] Meirelles himself cited Altman's work as an influence on his own career.[26]\n\nThe film was not without criticism. Peter Rainer of New York magazine stated that while the film was \"powerful\", it was also \"rather numbing\".[27] John Powers of LA Weekly wrote that \"[the film] whirs with energy for nearly its full 130-minute running time, it is oddly lacking in emotional heft for a work that aspires to be so epic – it is essentially a tarted up exploitation picture whose business is to make ghastly things fun\".[28]\n\nIvana Bentes, a Brazilian film critic, criticised the film for its depiction of the favela and her view that it glorified issues of poverty and violence as means of \"domestication of the most radical themes of culture and Brazilian cinema ... as products for export.\"[29] Bentes targets the film specifically in saying that: \"City of God promotes tourism in hell\".[30]\n\nCity of God was ranked No.3 in Film4's \"50 Films to See Before You Die\", and No.7 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[31] It was also ranked No.6 on The Guardian's list of \"the 25 Best Action Movies Ever\".[32][33] It was ranked No.1 in Paste magazine's 50 best movies of the decade of the 2000s.[34] Time listed it as one of the 100 greatest films of all time.[35][36]\n\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed City of God as the 17th best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members.[37]\n\n#### Top ten lists\n\nThe film appeared on several American critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2003.[38]\n\n- 2nd – Chicago Sun-Times (Roger Ebert) (for 2002)\n- 2nd – The Charlotte Observer (Lawrence Toppman)\n- 2nd – Chicago Tribune (Marc Caro)\n- 4th – New York Post (Jonathan Foreman)\n- 4th – Time (Richard Corliss)\n- 5th – Portland Oregonian (Shawn Levy)\n- 7th – Chicago Tribune (Michael Wilmington)\n- 10th – The Hollywood Reporter (Michael Rechtshaffen)\n- 10th – New York Post (Megan Lehmann)\n- 10th – The New York Times (Stephen Holden)\n\nIt is ranked No.38 on the BBC list of best 100 films of the 21st century.[39]\n\n### MV Bill's response\n\nBrazilian rapper MV Bill, a resident of Cidade de Deus, said the film had \"brought no good to the favela, no social, moral, or human benefit.\"[40] He said, \"The world will know that they exploited the image of the children who live here in Cidade de Deus. What is obvious is that they are going to carry a bigger stigma throughout their lives; it has only become greater because of the film.\"[12]: 123\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nCity of God won fifty-five awards and received another twenty-nine nominations.

The film has also sparked major increase in film productions, with over 45 being done during 2002. Films such as The Motorcycle Diaries and The Intruder are some of the films which have used Brazil for film production.[66]\n\nThe 2013 documentary City of God – 10 Years Later reunites the cast and crew of City of God and takes a look at how their lives have changed after the original film's release. In a BBC article written at the time of the documentary's release, Firmino mentions that the cast had mixed careers after the film's release. Firmino says that Jefechander Suplino, who played Clipper, could not be found by the documentary producers. His mother, however, believes him to still be alive, but is unaware of his whereabouts. Seu Jorge, who played Knockout Ned, had a better career after the film and became a major musician, performing at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony.[67]\n\nCity of God: The Fight Rages On, a miniseries set two decades after the events of the film, premiered in August 2024.[68]\n\n## See also\n\n- Film portal\n- Brazil portal\n- France portal\n- Germany portal\n- United States portal\n- 2000s portal\n- Crime portal\n\n- Docufiction\n- List of docufiction films\n- List of hood films\n- List of submissions to the 75th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n- List of Brazilian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\n- Sambhavami Yuge Yuge (2006 film), an Indian remake\n\n## Notes\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Cidade de Deus (City of God)\".

It is based on the 2020 novel by Rumaan Alam. The film stars Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, and Myha'la. Set on Long Island, it revolves around two families as they try to make sense of a rapid breakdown in phones, television, and other common technology which points to a potential cataclysm.\n\nLeave the World Behind had its world premiere at the AFI Fest on October 25, 2023. It was released in select theaters on November 22, 2023, before its streaming release by Netflix on December 8, 2023. It received positive reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nMisanthrope Amanda Sandford arranges an impromptu weekend getaway at a vacation rental with her husband Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose. After arriving at the rental, Amanda goes to the store. While shopping for groceries, Amanda sees a man stocking up on large quantities of canned food and water. Later, while the family relaxes at a nearby beach, they evade an oil tanker crashing on shore. When they return to the house, they notice the TV and Wi-Fi are not working and a pair of deer stare at them.\n\nThat night, the owner, George H. (\"G.H.\") Scott, and his daughter, Ruth, arrive at the house. Seeking shelter, G.H. explains that a blackout caused their return. Amanda is suspicious and doesn't want them to stay. Clay, however, trusts them and lets them stay the night. Later in the night, the television switches to displaying an Emergency Action Notification from the Emergency Alert System on all channels.\n\nThe next morning, Rose is frustrated that the Wi-Fi and TV are still down, which has prevented her from watching the series finale of Friends. Amanda notices four news alerts on her phone, two of which are about the blackout affecting the East Coast, the third alert about a hacker attack being behind the power outage and the final one beginning with the word \"Breaking\" and containing corrupted or encrypted text. Rose sees a much larger herd of deer standing motionless in the backyard.\n\nAttempting to learn about the disruptions and fix the Wi-Fi, Clay drives to town while G.H. heads to his neighbor's house. Clay gets lost and exits his car to look around, missing a few seconds of clear reception on the radio broadcasting news of the cyber attack having catastrophic environmental effects in the South. He finds a Spanish-speaking woman seeking help, but abandons her and eventually encounters a drone dropping leaflets written in Arabic. G.H. searches the neighbor's home, finds a satellite phone inside, and finds there is no signal from the satellites. On the beach nearby, he discovers the wreckage of a plane crash just before narrowly escaping another airliner crashing.\n\nRose walks with Archie in the woods, where they come across an empty shed and Archie removes a tick from his ankle on the way back. Returning to the house, G.H. confides to Amanda the events he has witnessed. He thinks that satellite connectivity has been disrupted, but he is cut off by a loud, shrill noise that lasts several seconds. Amanda recalls the man stockpiling supplies, whom G.H. assumes to be Danny, his contractor. Clay returns shaken with the leaflet, which Archie partially translates as \"Death to America\". The Sandfords decide to drive to Amanda's sister in New Jersey but find the expressway jammed with collided brand-new self-driving Teslas; they narrowly avoid more incoming Tesla cars continuing to drive into the pile-up, and are forced to return to G.H.'s house.\n\nThroughout the night, Ruth asks Clay provocative questions and they later discover flamingos in the pool. Amanda and G.H. establish a friendly bond but they are cut off by a second shrill noise, and the power fails. Later, Rose tells Amanda a version of the parable of the drowning man from an episode of The West Wing.\n\nThe next morning, Archie's teeth inexplicably fall out. Believing it is related to the tick bite, G.H. suggests visiting Danny for medicine. Rose is now missing and G.H. and Clay take Archie to visit Danny, while Amanda and Ruth search for Rose. At the shed, the two are confronted by an even larger herd of deer, which they scare away. G.H. and Clay attempt to convince Danny to help Archie, which results in an armed standoff between G.H. and Danny. Clay intervenes, convincing Danny to help Archie. Danny informs them that another neighbor may be equipped with an underground bunker and suggests that the shrill noises which have most likely led to Archie's teeth falling out result from use of microwave weapons.\n\nShaken, G.H. tells Clay and Archie that on the basis of his work with military contractors that the country is in a three-stage campaign leading first to breakdown of social order and resulting in a coup d'état or civil war. At the same time, Amanda and Ruth watch New York City being bombed. Rose then finds the neighbor's house with the bunker. Inside, a computer message warns of attacks by rogue military elements and elevated radiation levels in many U.S. cities. She finds a DVD of Friends and watches the series finale.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film stars , ,  and .\n\n- Julia Roberts as Amanda Sandford\n- Mahershala Ali as G.H.

Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington were set to star in and produce the film.[3]\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack and First Lady Michelle Obama executive-produced the film through their Higher Ground Productions banner. Obama included the novel on his 2021 summer reading list.[4]\n\n### Writing\n\nObama offered Esmail his thoughts on the screenplay during the writing process. Esmail said, \"He had a lot notes [sic] about the characters and the empathy we would have for them. I have to say he is a big movie lover, and he wasn't just giving notes about things that were from his background. He was giving notes as a fan of the book, and he wanted to see a really good film.\"[4]\n\n### Casting and filming\n\nIn September 2021, Mahershala Ali had been cast in the film, replacing Washington, who had left the project.[5] Ethan Hawke and Myha'la Herrold joined in January 2022.[6][7]\n\nFilming began in April 2022 on Long Island,[8] in a home designed by The Up Studio.[9] Additional filming took place in Katonah, New York, in May 2022.[10]\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nMac Quayle composed an original score for the film which consisted of nine notes and was inspired by French composer Olivier Messiaen and his Messiaen modes, namely Mode 3. Quayle said, \"I started playing around with them and I found that Mode 3, which is essentially a scale, was producing a really interesting harmonic feeling,\" going on to say \"And I got this idea that I might do the entire film in this one mode... I didn't know if it would carry me through the entire film, but it did.\"[11]\n\nEsmail tried to pick songs that had not been used on TV or film before as he was worried viewers would have associations with those songs that would \"interfere or complicate what the scene's about or what the viewer is feeling as they're watching the scene\". For example, Esmail chose \"Too Close\" by Next, a song that he felt was \"really funny and sweet at the same time\" and had not been overused in film, for a scene that \"goes from lighthearted and playful to sad and dark within a matter of a minute\".[11]\n\n## Release\n\nLeave the World Behind had its world premiere as the opening film of the AFI Fest on October 25, 2023, with the cast not attending due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[12] It was released in limited theaters on November 22, before streaming Netflix on December 8, 2023.[13]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 161 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"An exceptionally well-acted apocalyptic thriller, Leave the World Behind steadily draws the viewer in despite its leisurely pace and somewhat simplistic messaging.\"[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[15]\n\nIn a positive review for The Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan wrote, \"It plays like an M. Night Shyamalan movie, but without the supernatural element and with a thick vein of social critique running throughout. What happens may be extreme, but it feels based on mundane reality.\"[16] Wenlei Ma writing for The Sunday Times called the film \"jittery and suspenseful\", and that some overhead cinematography \"emphasises that we're all puppets in someone's else  [sic] marionette theatre ... we're not in control, but Esmail is of his startling, character-driven doomsday story\".[17]\n\nBilge Ebiri for Vulture compared the film unfavorably to Alam's book: \"every change made for the adaptation happens to be for the worse. ... the film doesn't demonstrate any kind of interest in, or affection for, its characters. ... This feels more like a collection of cool ideas than scenes that belong to the same emotional and consequential continuum.\"[18] Alissa Wilkinson for The New York Times wrote, \"After a while, the movie plays like a bulleted list of everything wrong with America ... the narrative tension dulls into passivity, both for us and for the characters\", and that the \"ending seems like a punchline.\"[19]\n\nEsmail said he hoped the film's ending would provoke conversation: \"...the expectation is at the end of [traditional disaster] films, your cast of characters overcomes the disaster and the world reverts back to some sane semblance of normalcy. I knew that I wasn't going to do that.\"[20]\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nFrom December 4 to December 10, 2023, the film topped the streaming charts and was the number one film on Netflix, with 41.7 million views.[21] By the end of 2023, it had accumulated 121 million views.[22] In January 2024, the film entered Netflix's most popular films of all-time list at eighth place, scoring 136.3 million views in its first 52 days.[23] As of September 2024, it is placed as the fifth most popular film in English of all time on Netflix, with 143.4 million views.[24]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                             | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                        | Recipient(s)                          | Result    | Ref.    |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| AARP Movies for Grownups Awards   | January 17, 2024    | Best Intergenerational Movie                                    | Leave the World Behind                | Nominated | [25]    |\n| AARP Movies for Grownups Awards   | January 17, 2024    | Best Actress                                                    | Julia Roberts                         | Nominated | [25]    |\n| People's Choice Awards            | February 18, 2024   | The Drama Movie of the Year                                     | Leave the World Behind                | Nominated | [26]    |\n| People's Choice Awards            | February 18, 2024   | The Female Movie Star of the Year                               | Julia Roberts                         | Nominated | [26]    |\n| People's Choice Awards            | February 18, 2024   | The Drama Movie Star of the Year                                | Julia Roberts                         | Nominated | [26]    |\n| Set Decorators Society of America | February 13, 2024   | Best Achievement in Décor/Design of a Contemporary Feature Film | David Schlesinger and Anastasia White | Nominated | [27]    |\n\n## Symbolism and subtext\n\nThe plot of the film Leave the World Behind is an apocalyptic scenario in which external threats and internal strife break down societal order. The narrative portrays humanity and modern civilization as vulnerable to coordinated attacks.[28]\n\nAs the white parents prepare for bed at a vacation rental, the property owner, a black father and his daughter unexpectedly arrive at their doorstep, fleeing from a dire situation unfolding in Manhattan, potentially affecting the entire United States. With internet, phones, and television all down, the family's confusion mounts. However, a Wall Street speculator, forewarned by a wealthy client, understands the gravity of the situation. America's enemies have launched a three-stage attack: first, they disable communication networks and infrastructure; second, they spread misinformation; and finally, they rely on Americans to descend into a kind of survival-of-the-fittest chaos. The ensuing pandemonium sees cities in flames and people turning on each other, marking the collapse of society.[28]\n\nThe oil tanker named White Lion running aground helps set the stage for the apocalyptic turn, immediately creating a sense of mystery and impending doom. Once the characters become aware of a widespread disaster, Ethan Hawke's character Clay Sandford attempts to connect the grounding of the tanker with an attack on America. Clay justifiably believes that whoever attacked the U.S. in \"Leave the World Behind\" would want to disrupt the American oil supply. However, the ship's name hints at a deeper meaning. The White Lion is a reference to the ship attributed to beginning slavery in America, symbolizing the arrival of the first African slaves to Virginia in 1619.[29]\n\nIn the novel, Amanda's character is \"more alarmed by the fact that the [Scotts] are Black—'those people didn't look the sort to own such a beautiful house,'[30] she and husband Clay question how their Airbnb landlords could be wealthy and black, and they were described as arriving in a car that was \"not so new as to be luxurious or so old as to be bohemian\".[31]\n\nNarrative techniques frame the contemporary disaster throughout the film within a broader context of the enduring moral reckoning around racism and poverty in the United States.[29][32][33]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Grobar, Matt (April 14, 2022). \"The Obamas' Higher Ground Boards Sam Esmail's Netflix Pic Leave the World Behind\".

However, Lisa soon learns that Jack is part of a scheme to assassinate the Head of Homeland Security and needs Lisa’s help to execute his devious plan.\n\n## The Best of Red Eye.\n\n- The Cast\n\nLisa (Rachel McAdams) and Jack (Cillian Murphy) are our two main stars and excel in their respective roles. In her personal life, Lisa is returning home from her grandmother’s funeral but when we examine her character from a professional lens, it’s evident that she treasures her job and is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the happiness of her guests.\n\nOn the other hand, Jack is an alluring character who Lisa initially seems unsure about but eventually finds herself chatting with him.\n\nWhen the two strangers discover they are seated next to each other on the plane, they continue to converse until Jack reveals his true motive. Upon realizing that she is the key to the success of Jack’s assassination plan, panic sets in and Lisa tries to maneuver her way out of this situation.\n\nHere, Lisa’s personality comes alive showcasing that she is a people pleaser while highlighting an incident from her past that has altered her mindset.\n\nPhoto Credit: Dreamworks Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJack has a domineering and distinctive perception of Lisa, mainly stemming from a sexist perspective in which he wants her to put her emotions at bay and focus on helping him accomplish his plan.\n\nAlthough one may argue that Lisa’s reaction is perfectly normal given this a life-threatening situation, Jack maintains a predujuiced perspective.\n\nHowever, Jack’s perception of Lisa and the reality of who she is make for a stark contrast that showcases itself in unexpected ways later on in the film.\n\nOverall, the two main leads add to the tense atmosphere as they commit to their roles and keep the audience engaged.\n\n- The Ongoing Thrilling Aspect\n\nFrom the moment Lisa and Jack sit next to each other on the plane, their conversation takes a sharp turn from polite and calming to demanding and threatening. This atmosphere of thrill and suspense only heightens as Lisa makes several attempts to alter the flight attendants or other passengers of Jack’s true intentions.\n\nHowever, Jack is quite perceptive and hijacks Lisa’s potential cries for help. The dialogue between the two is often filled with threats from Jack while Lisa urgently tries to plead with him.\n\nThis makes for some intense scenes as it seems that Jack is under an immense amount of pressure and will do whatever it takes to convince Lisa to help him.\n\nI appreciate that this film showcased the differences in how Jack is perceived by everyone among him.\n\nPhoto Credit: Dreamworks Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost of the flight attendants and passengers (in particular a woman who repeatedly asks for his help with her luggage) view Jack as your average kind gentleman while in the same breath, he is threatening Lisa and physically assaulting her.\n\nI also like the subtle detail of a young girl who knows that something is amiss between Jack and Lisa as children are often dismissed but this young child is convinced that Lisa is in danger.\n\nOverall, this film masters the element of surprise and thrill, leaving you wondering what will happen next.\n\n## The Worst of Red Eye.\n\n- An Underwhelming Second Act\n\nAs I said earlier, the tense environment in this film is consistently heightened. However, I found the second half of Red Eye to be lackluster as the plot transitions from being on the plane to landing in Miami where Lisa and Jack arrive.\n\nBeing on a plane in the sky with nowhere to go is the main detail about this movie that immediately captured my attention. In my opinion, that’s the selling point of Red Eye as we are stuck with our characters in the middle of the sky, through bad cell reception and turbulence.\n\nPhoto Credit: Dreamworks Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHowever, when we find ourselves in a different location, the plot becomes very predictable albeit still engaging. There are still several shocking moments involving the wider plot which still make for a captivating watch.\n\nAlthough this second half kept my eyes glued to the screen, I knew how this story would end and my predictions were correct.\n\n## My Overall Thoughts.\n\nGiven that this film premiered in 2005, there are a lot of elements that were a joy to experience such as the foreboding music, the dialogue, and that standard early 2000's look.\n\nDespite the underwhelming second half, this film has everything that makes for a good thriller which is supplemented by a great cast.\n\nAlso, many moments in this film made me think “How did none of the passengers see this?!”\n\nWhile flying everyone is in their world listening to music or watching a movie but there are plenty of moments where it’s evident that Lisa is in distress but no one comes to her aid. This aspect truly bewildered me.\n\nIf you haven’t watched Red Eye, you’re in for a treat!\n\nHere’s my post about the other films on my watchlist. :\n\nThe Dilemma of My Never-Ending Watch List. | by Hannah H | Never Stop Writing | Sep, 2024 | Medium\n\nHave you seen this film?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nFilm\n\nCinema\n\nMovies\n\nThriller\n\nTelevision\n\n--\n\n--\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Written by Hannah H\n\nHi!

However, Lisa soon learns that Jack is part of a scheme to assassinate the Head of Homeland Security and needs Lisa’s help to execute his devious plan.</summary>\n    </synopsis>\n    \n    <best_of>\n        <cast>\n            <character>\n                <name>Lisa</name> (Rachel McAdams) and <name>Jack</name> (Cillian Murphy) are our two main stars and excel in their respective roles. \n                In her personal life, <name>Lisa</name> is returning home from her grandmother’s funeral but when we examine her character from a professional lens, it’s evident that she treasures her job and is willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the happiness of her guests.\n                On the other hand, <name>Jack</name> is an alluring character who <name>Lisa</name> initially seems unsure about but eventually finds herself chatting with him.\n                When the two strangers discover they are seated next to each other on the plane, they continue to converse until <name>Jack</name> reveals his true motive. \n                Upon realizing that she is the key to the success of <name>Jack</name>’s assassination plan, panic sets in and <name>Lisa</name> tries to maneuver her way out of this situation.\n            </character>\n        </cast>\n        \n        <ongoing_thrilling_aspect>\n            From the moment <name>Lisa</name> and <name>Jack</name> sit next to each other on the plane, their conversation takes a sharp turn from polite and calming to demanding and threatening. \n            This atmosphere of thrill and suspense only heightens as <name>Lisa</name> makes several attempts to alter the flight attendants or other passengers of <name>Jack</name>’s true intentions.\n            However, <name>Jack</name> is quite perceptive and hijacks <name>Lisa</name>’s potential cries for help. \n            The dialogue between the two is often filled with threats from <name>Jack</name> while <name>Lisa</name> urgently tries to plead with him.\n            This makes for some intense scenes as it seems that <name>Jack</name> is under an immense amount of pressure and will do whatever it takes to convince <name>Lisa</name> to help him.\n            I appreciate that this film showcased the differences in how <name>Jack</name> is perceived by everyone among him.\n        </ongoing_thrilling_aspect>\n    </best_of>\n    \n    <worst_of>\n        <underwhelming_second_act>\n            As I said earlier, the tense environment in this film is consistently heightened. \n            However, I found the second half of <name>Red Eye</name> to be lackluster as the plot transitions from being on the plane to landing in Miami where <name>Lisa</name> and <name>Jack</name> arrive.\n            Being on a plane in the sky with nowhere to go is the main detail about this movie that immediately captured my attention. \n            In my opinion, that’s the selling point of <name>Red Eye</name> as we are stuck with our characters in the middle of the sky, through bad cell reception and turbulence.\n            However, when we find ourselves in a different location, the plot becomes very predictable albeit still engaging. \n            There are still several shocking moments involving the wider plot which still make for a captivating watch.\n        </underwhelming_second_act>\n    </worst_of>\n    \n    <overall_thoughts>\n        Given that this film premiered in <release_year>2005</release_year>, there are a lot of elements that were a joy to experience such as the foreboding music, the dialogue, and that standard early 2000's look.\n        Despite the underwhelming second half, this film has everything that makes for a good thriller which is supplemented by a great cast.\n        Also, many moments in this film made me think “How did none of the passengers see this?!”\n        While flying everyone is in their world listening to music or watching a movie but there are plenty of moments where it’s evident that <name>Lisa</name> is in distress but no one comes to her aid. \n        This aspect truly bewildered me.\n        If you haven’t watched <name>Red Eye</name>, you’re in for a treat!\n    </overall_thoughts>\n    \n    <additional_information>\n        <json>\n            {\n                \"genre\": \"Thriller\",\n                \"main_themes\": [\"Suspense\", \"Assassination\", \"Psychological Thriller\"],\n                \"complexity_level\": \"Medium\",\n                \"suspense_factor\": \"High\"\n            }\n        </json>\n    </additional_information>\n</article>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly structuring it according to the specified attributes, making it more reader-friendly and informative.",

It is based on the French graphic novel series The Killer written by Alexis \"Matz\" Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon.[5] The film stars Michael Fassbender alongside Arliss Howard, Charles Parnell, Kerry O'Malley, Sala Baker, Sophie Charlotte, and Tilda Swinton in supporting roles. Fassbender plays an assassin who embarks on an international vendetta after a hit goes wrong.\n\nDevelopment on the graphic novel adaptation began in 2007 at Paramount Pictures and Plan B Entertainment, with Fincher signed on as director and Alessandro Camon as screenwriter. In 2021, Fincher later moved the project over to Netflix with Andrew Kevin Walker replacing Camon as writer.\n\nThe Killer premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2023.[6] It received a limited theatrical release on October 27, 2023; it began streaming on Netflix on November 10, 2023. The film received positive reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nA professional hitman known only as The Killer stakes out a Parisian hotel room. He prepares to use a sniper rifle to kill a target who will check into the hotel room at an unknown time. While waiting for the target, he eats, practices yoga, listens to music (exclusively the Smiths), and talks on the phone with his handler, Edward \"Eddie\" Hodges, who is an attorney and his former university law professor. The target arrives with a dominatrix and The Killer shoots but misses, accidentally shooting the dominatrix. He flees, evading the police and disposing of his equipment. He then flies to the United States.\n\nThe Killer returns to his hideout in the Dominican Republic to find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala has been attacked. She is in the ICU of a hospital, with her brother watching over her. He says that Magdala was interrogated and tortured by two assassins but managed to injure one of them and escape. The Killer tracks down Leo, the taxi driver who drove the assassins to The Killer's home. Leo identifies one of the assassins, a strong man with a limp leg, nicknamed \"The Brute\", and a woman who resembles a Q-Tip, known as \"The Expert\". The Killer shoots Leo and seeks to track down the two assassins.\n\nThe Killer travels to Hodges' office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and enters the building disguised as a maintenance person. After forcing Dolores, Hodges' secretary, to restrain her boss and herself, The Killer destroys their electronics. As Hodges attempts to get The Killer to leave, The Killer shoots him in the chest with a nail gun to torture the names of the hitmen out of him. However, Hodges doesn't reveal the information and dies more quickly than The Killer anticipated. Dolores offers to show The Killer the assassins' identities in her paper files in her home, asking in return that The Killer give her a non-suspicious death so her children can claim a life insurance payout. After receiving the names at her home, The Killer breaks his rule not to show empathy; he snaps her neck and shoves her down a flight of stairs, making her death look like an accident, as she had requested. He then disposes of Hodges' body.\n\nThe Killer drives to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he confronts The Brute, whom he identifies by his limp. At night, he breaks into The Brute's home to kill him, but he is blindsided and tackled. A fight ensues, during which The Brute realizes who The Killer is before The Killer fatally shoots him and sets his house on fire with a Molotov cocktail.\n\nThe Killer travels to Beacon, New York, and confronts The Expert \"Q-Tip\" assassin in a gourmet restaurant. Appearing to accept her fate, The Expert offers to share with him a \"last supper\" of whiskey, during which she questions The Killer's motivations. They leave the restaurant and go to a park. After The Expert appears to slip down a small flight of ice-covered stairs, she asks The Killer to help her up, but The Killer shoots her, revealing that she was concealing a knife.\n\nThe Killer travels to Chicago, to kill billionaire venture capitalist Henderson \"Clay\" Claybourne, reflecting during his flight that police take more interest in the deaths of rich people. He uses tools bought on Amazon to enter Claybourne's penthouse. Confronting him, The Killer remains mostly silent. Claybourne says that he has no personal problem with The Killer and, as a first-time client of a hitman, agreed to pay Hodges for \"the trail to be scrubbed\", not knowing what that meant.

It moved again to Chicago in February 2022,[11] and then to St. Charles, Illinois (doubling for the city of Beacon, New York), in March 2022 for ten days, wrapping up later that month.[12][13]\n\n## Music\n\nIn February 2023, it was reported that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were composing for the film.[14] The film also includes the following songs from British rock band The Smiths (in order in which they appear in the film):[15]\n\n| No.           | Title                                  | Length   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1.            | \"Well I Wonder\"                        | 3:59     |\n| 2.            | \"I Know It's Over\"                     | 5:49     |\n| 3.            | \"How Soon Is Now?\"                     | 6:48     |\n| 4.            | \"Hand in Glove\"                        | 3:23     |\n| 5.            | \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\"               | 3:13     |\n| 6.            | \"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\"       | 3:36     |\n| 7.            | \"Girlfriend in a Coma\"                 | 2:03     |\n| 8.            | \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\"       | 2:58     |\n| 9.            | \"Unhappy Birthday\"                     | 2:45     |\n| 10.           | \"This Charming Man\"                    | 2:43     |\n| 11.           | \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" | 4:05     |\n| Total length: | Total length:                          | 41:22    |\n\n## Release\n\nFincher, editor Kirk Baxter, cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt, and sound designer Ren Klyce at the 2023 BFI London Film Festival.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Killer premiered in-competition at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2023.[6] It was picked up for a surprise screening at the 71st San Sebastián International Film Festival set for September 30, 2023.[16] It was also screened at the 28th Busan International Film Festival in the \"Icon\" section on October 6, 2023.[17]\n\nThe film began a limited theatrical release on October 27, 2023, via Netflix, before streaming on the platform on November 10, 2023.[18]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 288 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Killer finds director David Fincher on firm footing with a stylish and engaging thriller that proves a perfect match for leading man Michael Fassbender.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[20]\n\nTerming it a \"horribly addictive samurai procedural,\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that the film is \"entertainingly absurd and yet the pure conviction and deadpan focus that Fassbender and Fincher bring to this ballet of anonymous professionalism makes it very enjoyable.\"[21] IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio found it \"as unfeeling as any Fincher thriller, at once predictable in its simplicity but also strangely daring because of it\".[22] Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek, noting the proliferation of thrillers about contract assassins, praised Fincher for simplifying his entry into the subgenre to its essence, which Zacharek felt expanded its possibilities rather than limiting them, especially with Fassbender's performance effectively realizing them.[23]\n\nThe New York Times was less positive, with Manohla Dargis unmoved by character and plot but nonetheless impressed by the talents of Fincher and Fassbender. \"The character is boring and so is this movie, but like the supremely skilled Fincher, who can't help but make images that hold your gaze even as your mind wanders, Fassbender does keep you watching.\"[24]\n\nThe film has drawn comparisons to the 1967 film Le Samouraï.[25][26][27]\n\n### Accolades\n\n|

He prepares to use a sniper rifle to kill a target who will check into the hotel room at an unknown time. While waiting for the target, he eats, practices yoga, listens to music (exclusively the Smiths), and talks on the phone with his handler, Edward \"Eddie\" Hodges, who is an attorney and his former university law professor. The target arrives with a dominatrix and The Killer shoots but misses, accidentally shooting the dominatrix. He flees, evading the police and disposing of his equipment. He then flies to the United States.\n        \n        The Killer returns to his hideout in the Dominican Republic to find it has been broken into and his girlfriend Magdala has been attacked. She is in the ICU of a hospital, with her brother watching over her. He says that Magdala was interrogated and tortured by two assassins but managed to injure one of them and escape. The Killer tracks down Leo, the taxi driver who drove the assassins to The Killer's home. Leo identifies one of the assassins, a strong man with a limp leg, nicknamed \"The Brute\", and a woman who resembles a Q-Tip, known as \"The Expert\". The Killer shoots Leo and seeks to track down the two assassins.\n        \n        The Killer travels to Hodges' office in New Orleans, Louisiana, and enters the building disguised as a maintenance person. After forcing Dolores, Hodges' secretary, to restrain her boss and herself, The Killer destroys their electronics. As Hodges attempts to get The Killer to leave, The Killer shoots him in the chest with a nail gun to torture the names of the hitmen out of him. However, Hodges doesn't reveal the information and dies more quickly than The Killer anticipated. Dolores offers to show The Killer the assassins' identities in her paper files in her home, asking in return that The Killer give her a non-suspicious death so her children can claim a life insurance payout. After receiving the names at her home, The Killer breaks his rule not to show empathy; he snaps her neck and shoves her down a flight of stairs, making her death look like an accident, as she had requested. He then disposes of Hodges' body.\n        \n        The Killer drives to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he confronts The Brute, whom he identifies by his limp. At night, he breaks into The Brute's home to kill him, but he is blindsided and tackled. A fight ensues, during which The Brute realizes who The Killer is before The Killer fatally shoots him and sets his house on fire with a Molotov cocktail.\n        \n        The Killer travels to Beacon, New York, and confronts The Expert \"Q-Tip\" assassin in a gourmet restaurant. Appearing to accept her fate, The Expert offers to share with him a \"last supper\" of whiskey, during which she questions The Killer's motivations. They leave the restaurant and go to a park. After The Expert appears to slip down a small flight of ice-covered stairs, she asks The Killer to help her up, but The Killer shoots her, revealing that she was concealing a knife.\n        \n        The Killer travels to Chicago, to kill billionaire venture capitalist Henderson \"Clay\" Claybourne, reflecting during his flight that police take more interest in the deaths of rich people. He uses tools bought on Amazon to enter Claybourne's penthouse. Confronting him, The Killer remains mostly silent. Claybourne says that he has no personal problem with The Killer and, as a first-time client of a hitman, agreed to pay Hodges for \"the trail to be scrubbed\", not knowing what that meant. The Killer spares Claybourne, but he promises him a slow death if Claybourne ever targets him again. The Killer returns to the Dominican Republic and sits next to a recovering Magdala.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Michael Fassbender as The Killer, a professional assassin</Actor>\n        <Actor>Tilda Swinton as The Expert, a fellow assassin living in New York</Actor>\n        <Actor>Charles Parnell as The Lawyer, Hodges, The Killer's handler posing as a lawyer</Actor>\n        <Actor>Arliss Howard as The Client, Claybourne, a billionaire businessman</Actor>\n        <Actor>Kerry O'Malley as Dolores, an office administrator working for Hodges</Actor>\n        <Actor>Sophie Charlotte as Magdala, The Killer's girlfriend</Actor>\n        <Actor>Emiliano Pernía as Marcus, Magdala's brother</Actor>\n        <Actor>Gabriel Polanco as Leo, the taxi driver</Actor>\n        <Actor>Sala Baker as The Brute, an assassin who lives in Florida</Actor>\n        <Actor>Monique Ganderton as The Dominatrix</Actor>\n        <Actor>Daran Norris as Deep South Lounge greeter</Actor>\n        <Actor>Jack Kesy as Salesman</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    \n    <Reception>\n        <CriticalResponse>\n            On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 288 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

Wealth, lust, greed, these are frivolous hobbies of frivolous people. Their weaknesses.\n\n- ConnectionsRemake of Vash (2023)\n\n### User reviews1.1K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Complete waste of time\n\nThis film was incredibly frustrating to watch. The characters consistently displayed a lack of common sense, which made it difficult to connect with the story. It failed to fit into any discernible genre, lacking both the tension of a thriller and the scares of a horror film. Instead, it felt like a mundane narrative filled with contrived plot points and nonsensical actions.\n\nWhat was particularly disappointing was the apparent lack of effort put into developing the characters or exploring any meaningful themes. It's as if the filmmakers relied solely on tired clichés and tropes to drive the story forward, without injecting any originality or creativity.\n\nDespite the shortcomings of the script, Madhavan's acting managed to shine through. He brought depth and authenticity to his character, elevating the material and providing a much-needed anchor for the audience. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast, who struggled to make their poorly written characters relatable or engaging.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the film also left much to be desired. The cinematography was uninspired, the editing felt choppy and disjointed, and the soundtrack failed to leave any lasting impression. It's clear that no amount of technical expertise could salvage a film that was fundamentally flawed at its core.\n\nIn the end, this movie was a missed opportunity. With a more competent script and a director willing to take risks, it could have been something truly memorable. Instead, it's destined to fade into obscurity, overshadowed by far superior films.\n\nIn conclusion, I would strongly advise against wasting your time or money on this film.

It stars Ian McKellen as a career con artist who meets a wealthy widow (Helen Mirren) online, and then discovers that his plan to steal her fortune has unexpected roadblocks.\n\nThe film premiered at the BFI Southbank in London on October 28, 2019. It was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United Kingdom on November 8, 2019, and in the United States on November 15, 2019. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $33 million against a budget of $10 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 2009 London, ageing con artist Roy Courtnay's latest target is Betty McLeish, a recently widowed woman who has savings in excess of £2 million. Feigning a bad knee, Roy manipulates Betty into allowing him to stay at her house. He later encourages Betty to open a joint offshore investment account with him. Simultaneously, Roy and his business partner Vincent run an investment scam with their mark Bryn and his associate by employing fake Russian investors. One of the pretend Russians, actually a butcher, demands a greater cut of the take; in response, Roy orders thugs to break the butcher's hand. Realising that he was robbed, Bryn follows Roy during his date with Betty. Upon spotting Bryn, Roy sends Betty into the shops before luring him into Charing Cross tube station. There, Roy stabs Bryn and then shoves him into the path of an incoming train, killing him.\n\nRoy and Betty later go on holiday to Berlin. Betty's grandson Stephen takes the couple to a flat that Roy recognises. Stephen reveals that \"Roy Courtnay\"— a young British Army officer — was killed there in 1948 by a Nazi war criminal whom he was tracking, according to Soviet records. Roy narrates an elaborate story of his mission in Germany and explains at first that Hans Taub was his German translator. The mission ended in Hans's death. When Stephen refuses to believe his story, Roy is forced to confess that he is Hans, and that he stole Roy's identity so that he could leave Germany and reinvent himself. Betty accepts his explanation and dismisses Stephen's objections.\n\nRoy and Betty plan to transfer their money into the joint account. Vincent suggests to Roy that he leave at least some of the money for Betty to help with her medical condition, but Roy dismisses the idea and insists that he will leave Betty financially defrauded just like his previous victims. Vincent complies and later participates in the transactions necessary for the couple to transfer their money into the joint account. However, after leaving Betty and returning to his flat, Roy discovers that he no longer has the keypad needed to access the account. Roy returns to Betty's house to reclaim it, only to find Betty waiting for him and that all the house contents have been removed.\n\nBetty attempts to force a confession out of Roy, before revealing that her identity and personal history are all fake. Her real name is Lili Schroeder and she has met Roy before, in 1943, when they were both German teenagers and Hans was tutoring her in English. On their last session, after trying to kiss one of her sisters, Hans raped Lili. After her parents dismissed him, because of the kiss, from continuing his lessons, Hans denounced Lili's father as a traitor and he was executed by the Nazis. This drove Lili's mother to commit suicide. Later, Lili's sisters died in an explosion two weeks before the death of Adolf Hitler. After the war ended, Lili suffered at the hands of the Russians, learning to be a good liar for survival. Eventually, she made her way to England.\n\nLili has been aware of Roy's plan to con her all along. Stephen, who was actually the boyfriend of Lili's real grandson Michael, tracked Roy/Hans's criminal history and they confirmed his identity in a DNA test using a locket from Betty/Lili's childhood that contained a piece of Hans's hair. Vincent betrayed Roy after being confronted with her knowledge of their crimes.\n\nBetty takes all of Roy's money out of their joint account, leaving him only enough money to pay back the victims of his earlier con. As she prepares to leave the house, Roy locks the door and attacks her – but she fends him off before he is confronted by Bryn's associate and the butcher. Betty then leaves the house as Roy, refusing to pay his clients back, is consequently beaten up. Weeks later, Roy, having suffered a stroke during the fight, is in hospital, unable to speak or move. Vincent pays him a visit to gloat and bother him. Meanwhile, Betty lives happily with her extended family.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Helen Mirren as Betty McLeish/Lili Schroeder\n    - Nell Williams as Lili (1943)\n- Ian McKellen as Roy Courtnay/Hans Taub\n    - Phil Dunster as young Roy\n    - Laurie Davidson as Hans (1948)\n    - Spike White as young Hans\n- Russell Tovey as Stephen\n- Jim Carter as Vincent Halloran\n- Mark Lewis Jones as Bryn\n- Lucian Msamati as Beni\n- Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson as Vlad\n- Tunji Kasim as Michael\n- Céline Buckens as Annalise\n- Bessie Carter as Secretary\n\n## Production\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that Bill Condon would direct the film, with Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren cast in the leading roles.[6][7] In April 2018, Russell Tovey and Jim Carter joined the cast.[8]\n\nPrincipal production commenced on April 23, 2018, in London, England. The film was also shot in Berlin, Germany.[9]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film's world premiere was held on October 28, 2019, at the BFI Southbank in London.[10] It was released on November 8, 2019, in the United Kingdom, and on November 15, 2019, in the United States.[11]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Good Liar has grossed $17.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $16.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33.4 million,[5] against a production budget of $10 million.[4]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Charlie's Angels and Ford v Ferrari, and was projected to gross around $5 million from 2,439 theaters in its opening weekend.[12] It made $1.6 million on its first day and went on to debut to $5.6 million, finishing seventh at the box office.[3] It fell 40% to $3.6 million in its second weekend, finishing in tenth.[13]\n\n### Critical response\n\nRotten Tomatoes reported that 63% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Good Liar is less than the sum of its prestigious parts, but Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren keep the proceedings consistently watchable.\"[14] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[15] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed at PostTrak gave it 4 out of 5 stars, with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it.[3] The Guardian included it in a list of the most underrated films of 2019.[16]\n\nIn his review for The Wall Street Journal Joe Morgenstern wrote, \"\"The Good Liar\" is calculation from arch start to hollow finish... This film grows grim enough to be a companion piece.\"[17] Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times commented, \"The sleight of hand \"The Good Liar\" tries to pull off might be easier to keep hidden on the page. As it progresses, the film reveals complications (it plays particularly dubious tricks with the way it parcels out flashbacks to the 1940s) and a motive that might as well have been picked out of a hat. The finale could be written with entirely different details, and almost no scene preceding it would have to change. The real good liar is whoever convinced Mirren and McKellen to class up such thin and arbitrary material.\"[18] Peter Sobczynski writing for RogerEbert.com gave the movie two and half stars out of four and stated, \"...it quickly becomes apparent that this is one of those stories where nothing is quite as it seems, and leading to a shocking revelation that most will see coming, at least in the broad strokes. A film of this sort needs an airtight plot—or at least airtight enough to keep you from questioning things as it is running—but there are a few too many instances in which characters say and do things solely because the plot requires them to do so.\"[19] Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film three and half stars out of five and noted, \"...as a result, there's not much suspense. It's an enthralling exercise but a peculiarly cerebral one – a psychological thriller without the thrills.\"[20] The Guardian's Wendy Ide gave the film three stars out of five, stating, \"...The Good Liar is at its sparky best when Mirren and McKellen are on screen, waltzing smoothly through a plot that feels like a Russian doll of deeper and deeper deceptions. Flashes of violence are effectively jarring when juxtaposed with the chintzy cosiness of much of the film. Less successful are two thudding, lead-weight flashbacks, which disgorge chunks of exposition and quash some of the fun in McKellen and Mirren's deft double act.\"[21] Elizabeth Weitzman of TheWrap said, \"There's only one truly unpredictable twist in \"The Good Liar,\" and that's the disappointment audiences are likely to feel when they leave the theater.\"[22]\n\nThe Adelaide Review gave the movie 7/10 points, noting, \"Helen and Ian's first film together (although they've previously appeared as a double-act on the stage), this has an especially complex and even unpleasant performance by him, but she's no slouch too, and it's good to see Tovey holding his own in scenes alongside these two 'national treasures'. And yes, as Helen's Betty would say, \"It's so English!\"\"[23] In his review for Rolling Stone, David Fear gave the film two stars out of five and wrote, \"The real question is: Are you willing to endure all of that random swerving for the simple pleasure of these performers' company? Both actors are, unsurprisingly, bending over backwards here to sell these characters and establish enough screen chemistry to smooth over a lot of rough patches... They play off each other beautifully despite the material, and they get a chance to indulge in the aforementioned range of sound and fury. Yes, you would watch these two in virtually anything. You just wish it wasn't this. They deserve something sturdier and far less head-slappingly preposterous, and that's the truth.\"[24] Jon Frosch of The Hollywood Reporter added, \"An example of the kind of middlebrow, classily accoutered \"cinema for adults\" that's grown rare in the Age of Marvel, the film may pique the interest of viewers of a certain age; there's a comfy pleasure in watching these two pros patter back and forth in plummy accents, clutching mugs of tea or sipping flutes of champagne. Yet The Good Liar's sophistication is nothing if not skin-deep. For all its nasty twists and turns, its fake-outs and flashbacks and cheekily preposterous pile-up of double-crosses, this story of an elderly con man and the wealthy widow he targets feels fatally devoid of danger. Square, tame and tidy as the London-area house kept by Mirren's primly elegant, creamy-complexioned septuagenarian, The Good Liar is a work of skill but little spark.\"[25] Le News gave the film three stars out of four, stating. \"Two superb actors from the grand culture of English drama – Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen – are enough reason to pull you into this intriguing tale of deception... If you're looking for quality entertainment with an absorbing script, multiple twists and great acting, this is your film. Not a masterpiece, but captivating and satisfying.\"[26]\n\nDavid Hughes of Empire gave the film three stars out of five, commenting, \"...even if you know what's coming, there's joy in watching two flawless performances from these much-loved veteran actors, relishing every nuance of their characters, and every moment of their time on screen. They're so good, in fact, that the film flags every time one or both of them are off screen, such as during the flashback sequences, with which a more daring adaptation might have dispensed... It may be a shaggy-dog story, with occasional lapses into melodrama, but Mirren and McKellen are on sparkling form, and when a film aimed primarily at pensioners employs both the C-word and gory injury detail, you can't accuse it of being boring.\"[27] David Ehrlich of IndieWire stated, \"...it's Mirren who's ultimately asked to carry this movie across the finish line, and she does so with oodles of her signature elan. It's a rare actor who can split the difference between an airport thriller and a historical reckoning — who's able to conflate the silly with the serious in a way that completely erases the difference — but Mirren is more than up to the challenge. The final stretches of Condon's film are so ludicrous that you almost feel swindled for caring about the movie until that point, but Mirren grounds one plot twist after another with the gravity of her conviction (and a little help from Carter Burwell's lilting, uneasy, \"Mr. Holmes\"-esque score). \"The Good Liar\" may not have much to say about redemption, entrapment, or the fibs that can hold a friendship together, but the past is only so important to a wicked little thriller that delights in the moment at hand.\"[28] Jess Layt of Hawkesbury Gazette gave the movie 5.5/10 points, commenting, \"This is a story gives older actors some genuine character work, an actual story and motivations and a life. That being said, the way The Good Liar plays out in its final act feels like a bit of a hoodwink in itself. Audiences have been following these characters for a good chunk of film, only to have odd backstories suddenly revealed for which there is no apparent foreshadowing... The Good Liar, much like its protagonist, talks big game but is really just confused about its identity and place in the world.\"[29]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                              | Date of ceremony    | Category                       | Recipient(s)    | Result    | Ref(s)    |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| AARP Movies for Grownups Awards    | January 19, 2020    | Best Actress                   | Helen Mirren    | Nominated |           |\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists | 2020                | Actress Defying Age and Ageism | Helen Mirren    | Nominated |           |\n| Satellite Awards                   | December 19, 2019   | Best Actress, Drama            | Helen Mirren    | Nominated |           |\n| Saturn Awards                      | 2021                | Best Action or Adventure Film  | The Good Liar   | Nominated | [30]      |\n| The Queerties                      | February 26, 2020   | Film Performance               | Ian McKellen    | Nominated |           |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Carter Burwell to Score Bill Condon's 'The Good Liar' | Film Music Reporter\".

Night Shyamalan, and based on the 2021 novel by A. M. Shine.[5][6] It stars Dakota Fanning, Georgina Campbell, Olwen Fouéré and Oliver Finnegan, and follows Mina, a 28-year-old artist who becomes trapped in a vast, untouched forest in the west of Ireland. Seeking shelter, she becomes trapped alongside three strangers who are stalked by mysterious creatures every night.\n\nThe Watchers was released theatrically in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 7, 2024. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $33 million worldwide.\n\n## Plot\n\nA man in the forest gets lost and appears to be killed when he is dragged underground.\n\nAt a pet shop in Galway, Mina is asked to deliver a golden conure parrot to a zoo near Belfast. Midway through the journey, her car breaks down in a forest. As she tries to find her way, she encounters a bunker and a woman who tells her to get inside if she wants to live.\n\nThe woman, Madeline, is living in The Coop with Ciara and Daniel. Shortly after nightfall, they all assemble in front of the Coop's mirrored window for \"The Watchers\". Madeline tells Mina that the Watchers will enjoy meeting her and that she will be safe if she follows the rules: The Watchers kill anyone outside the Coop at night and nobody must enter the Burrows, the underground tunnels where the Watchers retreat during the day because of their aversion to sunlight.\n\nThe group has been stranded in the forest for several months. Ciara's husband John left the Coop days earlier but has not returned. Daniel helps Mina explore a Burrow, where she unearths several items like a camcorder and a bicycle and narrowly escapes a Watcher. That night, John appears at the Coop. Madeline refuses to let him in, convinced it is a Watcher imitating John. The Watchers crack the mirror in anger. Madeline returns the items to the Burrow to appease them.\n\nAs winter falls, the group begins to turn hostile against one another. Daniel locks Mina and Madeline out of the Coop one night, forcing them to seek shelter in the forest. They witness the Watchers, humanoid creatures that imitate the Coop's occupants and react angrily to Madeline and Mina's absence. The pair get back into the Coop and Madeline explains that the Watchers are shapeshifting fairies attempting to learn how to better mimic humans. The Watchers attack the Coop. The group retreats through a hidden door to an underground study. Mina uncovers Professor Rory Kilmartin's video diaries. Kilmartin had come to the forest to study the fairies. He captured one of them and bonded with it. In his last entry, the despondent professor explains how to escape from the forest and requests that his research be destroyed. He goes upstairs and shoots his captive and then himself.\n\nThe next day, the group follows the professor's directions to a river at the edge of the forest. Madeline shows them a stone marker where the fairies were imprisoned without their wings after a war with humans. A Watcher mimicking John kills Daniel. The others take the Professor's boat back to civilization.\n\nMina visits the professor's university office to destroy his notes. She learns humans and fairies once lived in harmony, with some even producing hybrid offspring that could withstand daylight. She is horrified to learn that Madeline looks like the Professor's wife who died in 2001 and realizes that Madeline is a fairy.\n\nAt Ciara's, they are attacked by Madeline. She explains she was outcast by the Watchers because she could endure sunlight. Mina convinces Madeline to spare her life by explaining that she is half-human. Mina implores Madeline to let go of her hatred towards humans and find other hybrids. Madeline sprouts wings and flies away.\n\nMina reconciles with her estranged twin sister and explains that Madeline now acts as a guardian for her, who is currently in the form of a young girl in a crowd.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Dakota Fanning as Mina/Lucy\n- Georgina Campbell as Ciara\n- Olwen Fouéré as Madeline\n- Oliver Finnegan as Daniel\n- Alistair Brammer as John, Ciara's husband\n- John Lynch as Professor Kilmartin\n\n## Production\n\nIn February 2023, New Line Cinema announced it would produce The Watchers, written and directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan in her feature directorial debut.[7] That April, Dakota Fanning and Georgina Campbell joined the cast.[8][9] Principal photography took place in Dublin, Wicklow and Galway from July to September 2023.[10][11] In mid-July, production was granted an interim agreement to continue filming during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[10] The film was self-financed by Ishana's father, M. Night Shyamalan, and sold to Warner Bros. for $30 million.[12]\n\nThe topic of nepotism was raised throughout the film's press tour because of Ishana's industry connection.[13][14][15] In an interview, she said, \"It's something that I consider and have considered every day in the process. I was very afraid of what those implications would be and if I would be judged. Having something to prove when you walk into a room and a space is never a bad thing and makes you work harder and makes you want it more.\"[13] In another interview, she said discussions around nepotism were \"totally valid\", that what was important was the \"reaction to the privilege\", and: \"By nature of being born into this life and having a parent in the industry, there's definitely a sort of advantage stepping into the field, you just have that sense of being able to achieve it – I think as with any child pursuing their parent's field.\"[14]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Watchers was theatrically released in the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland on June 7, 2024, by Warner Bros. Pictures.[12] The release was briefly shifted to June 14 before returning to its original date.[7][16] It was titled The Watched in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[1]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Watchers grossed $19.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $13.9 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $33 million.[2][17]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, The Watchers was released alongside Bad Boys: Ride or Die, and was projected to gross around $8–10 million from 3,350 theaters in its opening weekend.[18] The film made $2.9 million on its first day (including $1 million from Thursday night previews) and went on to gross $7 million from its opening weekend, finishing in fourth.[12][2][17]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 32% of 176 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Heavy on eerie mood but undone by an obtuse script, The Watchers can only hold the gaze for so long before tedium sets in.\"[19] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[20] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 55% overall positive score, with 36% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[12]\n\nSeveral critics negatively compared Shyamalan's style to her father's.[a] Dylan Roth of The Observer commended the Shyamalan family for \"never obscuring the nepotism at play\" during the press tour, but wrote, \"The Watchers did not convince me of much. Worse, it is precisely what I'm sure the young director hoped it wouldn't be—a pale imitation of her father's patented style.\"[15] In a similarly negative but contrasting review, Bob Strauss of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \"There's an inelegant blend of Celtic folklore thriller ... [and] contemporary horror movie tropes that renders the result unsatisfying for fans of either genre. And yet, Shyamalan proves herself a proficient director throughout most of this slog.\"[25] RelishMix, which analyzes activity across social media platforms to summarize the public's general responses to a film's marketing, said it received 9% more attention than \"first installment horror norms\" but that \"negative convo on The Watchers is limited to those turned off by M. Night Shyamalan's involvement as a producer after being dissatisfied with many of his past cinematic ventures.\"[12]\n\nIn a mixed review for AV Club, Katie Rife concluded, \"The Watchers is clearly a first film, with the promise and the problems that come with it.\"[26] Michael Phillips's review for Chicago Tribune, rated three out of four stars, stated that Shyamalan \"works well with cinematographer Eli Arenson to envelop the chamber-sized ensemble in various shades of dread, or comfort.\"[27] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film 2.5/5 stars, writing, \"The Watchers starts on an extremely promising note. But only a small fraction of the anticipation that it raises is satiated. Be that as it may, there is just enough in the shadows that the director creates to make sizeable chunks of the film watchable, even immersive.\"[28]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Multiple references:[15][21][22][23][24]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"The Watched (15)\".

Carla notices that Heather has framed insects on the wall one of which is the tarantula hawk which buries itself into the victims stomach and eats their tissue from the inside out avoiding any major organs meaning the victim stays alive, the hawk will then lay eggs then crawl out and die.  Heather then points Carla to an information booklet about Simon with photos of him in as well. Carla recognises him as the man that paid her for unprotected sex. Carla is then chloroformed.\n\nAct 3- Carla is bound and gagged to a chair and Heather talks about how horribly Carla has treated her and she then threatens Carla with death, that she will take her child from her, that she has already killed Simon.

British, manor, orphans, illness, love affairs, duplicitous characters, plots within plots, etc. All of that, the movie does well.\n\nDo we need another Gothic mystery of orphaned child becoming entwined with a decaying family and its manor? Probably not. Do the actors move past the 2 dimensional nature of their characters? Decidedly no. Does the story line bring anything new or ingenious to the story? A resounding no.\n\nPart of the issue I see is that the main character is the young orphaned girl and her movement into this family and the machinations of the plot. She's not that interesting of a character. And the narrow focus that the film takes toward her shuts out the other characters from being able to provide much richness to the story.\n\nThis harkens to the great movie and story of Rebbeca in many ways. But that film allowed other characters room to play, and the uncertainty of motivations and conniving increased the sense of tension and dread.

Scott\n\n- May 2, 2019\n\n“The Intruder,” a real-estate-based thriller set in California’s Napa Valley, is more silly than scary. This doesn’t seem to be entirely intentional, and it isn’t altogether unwelcome. The idea of Dennis Quaid popping up in your kitchen in the middle of the night might not exactly be the stuff of nightmares. Quaid, playing a deranged ex-homeowner named Charlie Peck, seems to know this. And the director, Deon Taylor, does too.\n\nStill, there are a few jolts and a heavy dose of caveat emptor. The emptors are Scott and Annie Howard, a couple from San Francisco who buy Foxglove, a rambling ivy-covered pile that has been in Charlie’s family for generations. Annie (Meagan Good), a writer for women’s magazines, falls in love with the house. Scott (Michael Ealy), a big-shot marketing strategist, isn’t so sure, but an isolated house at the end of a spooky, tree-lined driveway seems like the perfect place to start a family.\n\nCharlie couldn’t be more obliging. He shows up to mow the grass, brings pies for Thanksgiving dinner and helps Annie hang Christmas lights. It takes her a comically long time to detect the creepiness in his attentions, given the twitchy, eyeball-rattling derangement that Quaid brings even to Charlie’s quieter moments. Scott figures out what’s going on a little faster, but behaves like enough of a jerk to make Charlie look sympathetic. Eventually things move from creepy to murdery, as everyone in the audience always knew they would.\n\nA preview of the film.Credit...CreditVideo by Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere isn’t a lot going on here. Annie and Scott have exactly two friends (Joseph Sikora and Alvina August), no family to speak of and not much to talk about. There’s a hint of domestic trouble in their background, and a tragedy in Charlie’s that turns out to be something much worse. But David Loughery’s functional script doesn’t spend much time exploring motives or psychological nuances. Scott needs to defend his wife and his property, both of which Charlie regards as rightfully belonging to him.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Anyone already familiar with the book is at an advantage. More power to you if this is the case. The rest of us are coming in cold. Or after watching the trailer. You do you. If your like me, the casting of Leighton Meester is what will draw your interest in watching the movie. Suffice it to say, I came out feeling rather disappointing.The gist of the film is that Beth (Leighton Meester) gets accused of killing her recently divorced best friend, Kate (Christina Wolfe). Naturally, Beth does her own investigation to uncover the truth. Of course, she uncovers things that I’m sure she wished she had known earlier.Some changes right off the bat: Orla is now Beth. She’s still a mother and married to Rob (Luke Norris). Another major change is that the book’s setting is in Lisbon where the film moves its setting to Croatia. I’m assuming that this change is because of the pandemic but I could be wrong. I can only wonder why are there changes to the names or location? Is it because of Meester’s casting? Is she more of a Beth than an Orla? The book is also described as “a twisty holiday read for fans of The Holiday and Date Night.”Netflix is pumping out at least one major film a week. Some of them are actually good. Others are no different than the straight-to-video films that always by pass the theaters. The sad part is that we never really know which films are going to be good. I saw Leighton Meester’s name and thought, okay, I’ll check this film out. If I’m being honest, my focus is extremely terrible of late so I ended up watching the film twice. While my focus was better on the second viewing, the film itself is not. The Weekend Away is a super generic murder mystery thriller that feels like it would be perfect airing on Lifetime. A character like Zain (Ziad Bakri) feels like he’s only in the film to be a cliché of a character that only feels the diversity checkbox. Another film would probably treat his character differently.Thrillers need to have us on the edge of our seats. The Weekend Away is unable to do even that. I mean, the twists and turns more or less become so predictable. The funny part is that people are going to see the film is new on Netflix this weekend and give it a watch. This is how bad films like Love Hard enter the Netflix Top Ten. Do yourself a favor and just watch something else instead. There are good murder mysteries out there but this is not one of them.DIRECTOR: Kim Farrant\nSCREENWRITER: Sarah Alderson\nCAST: Leighton Meester, Christina Wolfe, Ziad Bakri, Luke NorrisNetflix will launch The Weekend Away on March 3, 2022.

Sarah Alderson adapts the script from her book of the same name. Anyone already familiar with the book is at an advantage. More power to you if this is the case. The rest of us are coming in cold. Or after watching the trailer. You do you. If you're like me, the casting of Leighton Meester is what will draw your interest in watching the movie. Suffice it to say, I came out feeling rather disappointing. The gist of the film is that Beth (Leighton Meester) gets accused of killing her recently divorced best friend, Kate (Christina Wolfe). Naturally, Beth does her own investigation to uncover the truth. Of course, she uncovers things that I’m sure she wished she had known earlier. Some changes right off the bat: Orla is now Beth. She’s still a mother and married to Rob (Luke Norris). Another major change is that the book’s setting is in Lisbon where the film moves its setting to Croatia. I’m assuming that this change is because of the pandemic but I could be wrong. I can only wonder why are there changes to the names or location? Is it because of Meester’s casting? Is she more of a Beth than an Orla? The book is also described as “a twisty holiday read for fans of The Holiday and Date Night.” Netflix is pumping out at least one major film a week. Some of them are actually good. Others are no different than the straight-to-video films that always bypass the theaters. The sad part is that we never really know which films are going to be good. I saw Leighton Meester’s name and thought, okay, I’ll check this film out. If I’m being honest, my focus is extremely terrible of late so I ended up watching the film twice. While my focus was better on the second viewing, the film itself is not. The Weekend Away is a super generic murder mystery thriller that feels like it would be perfect airing on Lifetime. A character like Zain (Ziad Bakri) feels like he’s only in the film to be a cliché of a character that only feels the diversity checkbox. Another film would probably treat his character differently. Thrillers need to have us on the edge of our seats. The Weekend Away is unable to do even that. I mean, the twists and turns more or less become so predictable. The funny part is that people are going to see the film is new on Netflix this weekend and give it a watch. This is how bad films like Love Hard enter the Netflix Top Ten. Do yourself a favor and just watch something else instead. There are good murder mysteries out there but this is not one of them.\"\n        }\n    </additionalInformation>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\n### Explanation\n- The **name** of the movie is clearly stated as \"The Weekend Away\".\n- The **genre** is identified as \"Thriller\".\n- The **release year** is noted as \"2022\".\n- The **director** is mentioned as \"Kim Farrant\".\n- The **additional information** is provided in JSON format, including details about the screenwriter, cast, premiere date, grade, and a summary of the review.\n\nThis structured format makes the information clear and accessible while maintaining the original content's meaning.",

The film stars Kiera Allen as disabled teenager Chloe Sherman, who begins to suspect that her mother, Diane (Sarah Paulson), has been keeping a dark secret about her upbringing. The film has connections to other films by Chaganty and Ohanian and is the second installment in the filmmaking duo's Searching film series.\n\nRun was released in the United States via streaming on November 20, 2020, on Hulu, and was released in other territories both theatrically and through streaming by Lionsgate International and by Netflix on April 2, 2021. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and became Hulu's most successful original film upon its release.\n\n## Plot\n\nA woman named Diane Sherman gives birth to a premature baby, whom she goes to see lying in an incubator, surrounded by the hospital staff. Years later, Diane lives a quiet life with her now teenage daughter, Chloe. Due to the circumstances of her birth, Chloe suffers from arrhythmia, hemochromatosis, asthma, and diabetes, as well as paralysis in her legs. She uses a wheelchair, takes multiple medications daily, and is homeschooled by her mother. Chloe desires to go to college, something Diane seems to support, but has received no responses for her applications.\n\nOne morning, while looking through a bag of groceries for chocolate, Chloe finds a prescription bottle of green pills with Diane's name on the label. However, when Chloe later inspects the bottle, she finds a label bearing her name has been pasted over the original. She tries to research the name of the pills—Trigoxin—but discovers the house has no internet connection, unaware Diane is watching her with the router unplugged. The next day, Chloe dials a random number from her mother's bedroom phone, and asks the answering stranger to look up the drug. He tells her it is a heart medication and that all pictures of the medication show a small red pill.\n\nLater, while pretending to go to the bathroom at the movie theater, Chloe rushes to the nearby pharmacy across the street. The pharmacist at the desk reveals the green pills are actually a relaxant called Ridocaine, which had been only approved for dogs and, if they were being taken by a human, it could paralyze their legs. Chloe begins to hyperventilate before Diane runs in and sedates her to take her home.\n\nChloe wakes up in bed and finds her bedroom door locked from the outside, while Diane is out running an errand. She breaks out of her room by dragging herself onto the roof, eventually making her way to her mother's bedroom and breaking the window with a soldering iron and water. She begins to have an asthma attack and only barely manages to crawl to her room to retrieve her inhaler. She tries to use her automated wheelchair ramp to go downstairs, but finds that Diane has cut the power cord. She is forced to throw her wheelchair down the stairs and accidentally falls, sustaining minor injuries but also discovering that she can move one of her toes, due to having not taken Ridocaine in the last few days.\n\nOutside down the road, Chloe sees a mail truck and rushes to stop it; she explains her situation to Tom, the postal worker, who agrees to help her. Diane pulls up and Chloe asks Tom to contact the police. He, however, confronts Diane and tells her she can't take Chloe home. While closing up the van to take Chloe to the police station, Diane suddenly appears and stabs Tom in the neck with a syringe. Chloe hyperventilates again and blacks out. When she awakens, she is in the basement of her house, with her wheelchair chained to a steel pole as Diane drags Tom's body through her hallway.\n\nWhile in the basement, Chloe discovers her childhood photos, which show her walking, a death certificate for a girl named Chloe who died two hours and eleven minutes after her birth, and an article about a couple who had their baby stolen from the same hospital. She also finds college acceptance letters that were hidden from her. When Diane enters, Chloe accuses her of poisoning her along with lying to her about her medical conditions and demands the truth. Diane insists everything she ever did was to help and protect Chloe, exclaiming that she saved her. Diane then fills a syringe with paint thinner, saying it will make her forget. Terrified, Chloe crawls away and locks herself in a closet. She then swallows a bottle of organophosphate, forcing Diane to rush her to the hospital.\n\nChloe wakes up in a hospital bed, intubated and barely able to move. Diane insists that her \"daughter\" be discharged, but the doctors refuse until Chloe has been evaluated by a mental health professional. Chloe signals to a nurse, who brings her a crayon and paper. While Chloe is attempting to write \"MOM\" on the paper, a code blue is called and the nurse rushes out. Armed with a handgun, Diane then sneaks in and ties Chloe to a wheelchair to escape; the nurse finds the bed empty and alerts hospital security. As Diane tries to find an exit, Chloe is able to move her foot and hold the chair in place. Chloe replies that she doesn't need her but Diane viciously states she will. Diane aims her gun at security guards, yelling \"We are going home!\" as she is cornered and shot in the arm, causing her to fall down the stairs.\n\nSeven years later, Chloe still relies on her wheelchair, although is able to walk short distances using a cane. She visits \na correctional facility where Diane is confined to a bed in the infirmary ward. Chloe then talks about the life she had built for herself: her husband, Ara, daughter, Annie, and work. She mentions that Annie has a preference in grandparents, implying that Chloe had been reunited with her birth parents. She takes out three plastic-wrapped Ridocaine pills that were concealed under her tongue, and tells Diane that she still loves her before asking her to open her mouth wide.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Sarah Paulson as Diane Sherman, Chloe's \"mother.\"\n- Kiera Allen as Chloe Sherman, Diane's \"daughter.\"\n- Pat Healy as the mailman, Tom.\n- Sara Sohn as the hospital nurse, Kammy.\n- Sharon Bajer as Kathy Bates, a homage to the actress of the same name.[4]\n- Tony Revolori as Brooklyn Boy (voice)\n\n## Production\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced Lionsgate would produce, distribute, and finance the film, with Aneesh Chaganty directing, from a screenplay he wrote alongside Sev Ohanian. Ohanian and Natalie Qasabian produced the film.[5] In October 2018, Sarah Paulson joined the cast of the film,[6] and in December 2018, Kiera Allen was set to star as well.[7]\n\nPrincipal photography in Winnipeg, Canada began on October 31, 2018, and wrapped on December 18, 2018.[8]\n\nTorin Borrowdale composed the film's score, as he previously collaborated with Chaganty in Searching. According to Borrowdale, the goal for the film's musical direction was to achieve \"the essence of Bernard Herrmann, but for a 2020 cinematic experience.\"[9] The film was a joint production between Summit Entertainment, Lions Gate Films, Search Party Productions, and Hulu Original Films.[10][11][12]\n\n## Release\n\nRun was originally scheduled to be theatrically released on May 8, 2020, coinciding with Mother's Day weekend,[13] although as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, its release was delayed indefinitely. Lionsgate intended to announce a new release date \"once there is more clarity on when movie theaters\" will reopen.[14]\n\nIn August 2020 however, with the pandemic's continued influence on the film industry, Hulu acquired American distribution rights to the film,[15] and it debuted exclusively through them via streaming on November 20, 2020.[16] The movie was released in other continents under Lionsgate International banner.[11]\n\nNetflix later acquired international streaming rights and released the film on April 2, 2021.[17]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nFollowing its debut weekend, Hulu reported that Run was the most-watched original film in the platform's history, as well as the most talked about on Twitter.[18]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 139 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Solid acting and expertly ratcheted tension help Run transcend its familiar trappings to deliver a delightfully suspenseful thriller.\"[19] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[20]\n\nJessica Gomez of AllHorror.com wrote, \"If you're like me and you were captivated by the story of Gypsy Rose and her mother Dee Dee Blanchard, then I've got a psychological thriller with your name on it.\"[21] Ryan Lattanzio of IndieWire gave the film a \"C+\" and said, \"There's enough go-for-broke and whiplash-inducing shifts in tone on display to suggest this filmmaking duo has a future, even when their characters don't seem to have a past.\"[22]\n\nRahul Desai of Film Companion wrote, \"The film doubles up as an allegory and indictment of modern parenting – the control disguised as caregiving, the lack of identity, the incessant smothering, the manipulation, and the blurred line between selflessness and selfishness\".[23]\n\n## Related films\n\n### Searching (2018)\n\nIn November 2018, Ohanian revealed that Run includes intentional references to his previous film Searching, while also stating that the latter has connections to the prior as well.[24] Later in November 2020, Chaganty and Ohanian revealed that one of these connections involves a brief appearance by the character of Hannah Pardy from Searching as a stock photo model. The filmmaking duo stated that the references between their movies establish that they take place within the same fictional continuity.[25]\n\n### Missing (2023)\n\nIn November 2022, Ohanian revealed that during the events of Missing, connections to Run will be explored, including revealing what happened to its main characters. The filmmaker referred to the plot-thread as an epilogue to cliffhanger ending.[26]\n\n## See also\n\n- Munchausen syndrome by proxy\n- Gypsy Rose case\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Run\". Nightstream.

The film stars Dylan Walsh, Sela Ward, Penn Badgley, Amber Heard and Jon Tenney.\n\nThe Stepfather was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on October 16, 2009. The film received negative reviews from critics and grossed $31 million against its $20 million budget.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn a suburban Utah house, Grady Edwards shaves off his beard, dyes his hair, and removes his brown contact lenses. As he leaves, it is revealed that he has murdered his wife and three children. When the police investigate, it is said that another family in New Jersey was murdered in a similar manner not long ago, which causes them to believe there is a serial killer on the loose.\n\nSusan Harding, a recently divorced Oregon housewife, is shopping in a grocery store with her youngest children when she meets Grady, who introduces himself as \"David Harris\", and claims that his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. Susan, desperate for love, is charmed by David, and rushes into an engagement to be married in less than six months.\n\nSusan's eldest son, Michael, returns home from military school and is immediately suspicious of his mother's new fiancé. David invites him down to the basement, where he has installed locked cabinets and tries successfully to befriend him over tequila shots.\n\nHowever, Michael's suspicions start when David uses the wrong name when mentioning his deceased daughter. After Susan says that a neighbor warned her that America's Most Wanted ran a profile on a serial killer who looks like David, he sneaks into the neighbor's house, throws her down the basement stairs, then suffocates her.\n\nJay, Susan's ex-husband, angrily confronts David over laying hands on his younger son Sean. He warns Susan that she knows nothing about him. Doubts about David mount further when he quits his job working as a real estate agent for Susan's sister, Jackie, to avoid displaying a photo ID and other forms of identification.\n\nLater, Jay confronts David about an apparent lie regarding his college history. David clubs him with a vase and suffocates him with a plastic bag. He texts Michael with Jay's phone saying that David checked out okay.\n\nWhen the neighbor's body is discovered two weeks later, David tells the family. Michael is alarmed because he overheard David being told by the mailman, who gave less detail than David tells them. While Michael's girlfriend Kelly tries to get him to focus on college applications, he grows more obsessed with the contradictions in David's stories. The situation comes to a head when David intercepts an email from Jackie about hiring an investigator. He then goes to her house and drowns her in her pool.\n\nDetermined to discover what is in the locked cabinets, Michael breaks into the basement as Kelly keeps a lookout. Michael eventually discovers his dad's body in a freezer. David knocks out Kelly and traps Michael in the basement.\n\nThe commotion awakens Susan, and David berates her parenting skills, saying that he thought she could be \"Mrs. Grady Edwards\". On Susan's stunned reaction, he grimaces and asks, \"Who am I here?\" Susan tries to snap him out of it, causing him to say, \"David! I'm David Harris!\"\n\nSusan, realizing the situation after noticing the unconscious Kelly, flees to the bathroom, locking herself in. David kicks the door in, shattering the mirror behind it. Susan picks up a shard of the mirror, holding it behind her. David grabs her, they struggle, and she manages to stab him in the neck with the shard. He falls into the bathtub, apparently dead.\n\nMichael escapes from the basement and finds Kelly. They find Susan in the hallway across from the bathroom, thinking David is dead. Then David approaches from behind and blocks the stairs, chasing all of them into the attic, where he and Michael fight. Both fall onto the roof and then off its edge to the ground, where they lie unconscious.\n\nWhen Michael wakes up, he finds out he has been in a coma for just over a month. He learns that David is still alive and fled the scene before the police arrived. The end scene shows David, who has again changed his appearance and his name to Chris Ames. He is working at a hardware store when he meets a woman who is shopping with her two sons.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Dylan Walsh as Grady Edwards / David Harris / Chris Ames\n- Sela Ward as Susan Harding\n- Penn Badgley as Michael Harding\n- Amber Heard as Kelly Porter\n- Sherry Stringfield as Leah\n- Paige Turco as Jackie Kerns\n- Jon Tenney as Jay\n- Nancy Linehan Charles as Mrs. Cutter\n- Marcuis Harris as Det.

There are times that I look at a list of actors in a film and think that it must be good because of the star power and a general level of respect for the projects of those involved in the film. Twisted is one of those films. With stars like Samuel Jackson, David Strathairn, and Andy Garcia, I thought this film was pretty much guaranteed to be good. Even knowing that I’m not usually a fan of the roles Ashley Judd usually lands herself in didn’t dissuade my optimism. Boy was I wrong.\n\nAshley Judd is Jessica Shepard, a Bay Area police officer who’s quite good at what she does. She’s just been promoted to inspector in the homicide division. Her mentor is John Mills (portrayed by Samuel Jackson) who also raised her after the death of her parents. It seems her father went on a killing spree which ended when he killed his wife, then committed suicide.\n\nJessica is assigned to see a departmental psychiatrist, Dr. Frank (portrayed by David Strathairn) after a bust where it’s believed she might have used excessive violence on the suspect. She doesn’t really think much of the sessions but does start to open up to the doctor as time progresses.\n\nJessica’s vice is that she picks up men in bars and has sex with them. It’s meaningless sex with strangers, and she doesn’t even seem to be enjoying it. She also drinks quite a bit, and soon begins having blackouts.\n\nHer new partner is Mike Delmarco (portrayed by Andy Garcia). The two are assigned a case and the body turns out to be that of one of Jessica’s lovers from more than a month prior. Soon another body turns up, also one of her former lovers. The crimes are connected through the manner of the death as well as a single cigarette burn on the back of the hand.\n\nJessica starts wondering if she’s starting to become like her father with a mental illness driving her to kill and if history is repeating itself in a sense.\n\nThere were so many issues with Twisted that I hardly know where to start. The writing is absolutely horrid. There was little I found surprising or suspenseful in the script. Everything was tremendously predictable. The morning the second murder is discovered after Jessica has blacked out once again, she touches her face to find her finger is bleeding. I knew right away they would discover her blood on the victim, but that it was planted there. The story is entirely too obvious all the way along. At around the 40-minute point in the movie, it’s also made pretty obvious who the real killer is.\n\nIt was also pretty obvious that her blackouts were drug-induced right from early on. If the audience can figure it out, I would think this crack inspector could as well.\n\nThere were also plot holes aplenty throughout the film. Two partners who start to have feelings for each other, and yet they are allowed to remain working together? And in a case where one partner has had relationships with all the victims? No one on the force seems to care for Jessica except her partner and John Mills, although her supervisor Lt. Tong (portrayed by Russell Wong) seems to have some admiration for her ability to solve crimes and dedication. However, since the writing is so poor, I never got a feeling for what Tong really thought of Jessica as he’s terribly underused as a character.\n\nMost of the characters are so cardboard that I can’t really fault the actors, although all of the performances are terrible and wooden. Even the normally stellar Samuel Jackson seems like he’s only in the role half-heartedly. I can’t imagine what drew Andy Garcia to the role unless it was hacked to death from what it originally was. The entire story is completely unbelievable and contrived, and it seems like at some point the actors realized it and wondered what they were doing there.\n\nAshley Judd portrays the same character through most of the movies she makes. That’s the problem – all of the roles seem to be the same, and none are memorable. It’s the same character from Kiss the Girls and Double Jeopardy. I know she is capable of more, but I think she sometimes chooses scripts where the characters are too familiar.\n\nThere’s some interesting cinematography, but that can’t rescue Twisted from a poor script. Despite the star power, this is a horrible disappointment and something that you don’t have to feel bad about missing, even if you are generally a fan of any of these actors.\n\n\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n• Commentary by Director Philip Kaufman\n• Creating a Twisted Web of Intrigue\n• The Inspectors: Clues to the Crime\n• San Francisco: Scene of the Crime\n• Cutting Room Floor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Bluesky\n- Threads\n- Tweet\n- Reddit\n- Share on Tumblr\n- Email\n- Mastodon\n\n### Like this:\n\n### Related\n\nCategories: Movie Reviews\n\nTagged as: Andy Garcia, Ashley Judd, crime, David Strathairn, Drama, movie review, Movie Reviews, mystery, Russell Wong, Samuel L.

I haven’t seen “Twisted,” so I can’t judge it for myself, but it does seem like the weak link here is the screenwriter (Sarah Thorp) and the script that Kaufman and the cast had to work from.  \nGood review!\n\nLoading...\n\n\n\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a ReplyCancel reply\n\n### Follow me on Twitter\n\n### Goodreads\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrivacy &amp; Cookies: This site uses cookies.

There are times that I look at a list of actors in a film and think that it must be good because of the star power and a general level of respect for the projects of those involved in the film. <name>Twisted</name> is one of those films. With stars like <actor>Samuel Jackson</actor>, <actor>David Strathairn</actor>, and <actor>Andy Garcia</actor>, I thought this film was pretty much guaranteed to be good. Even knowing that I’m not usually a fan of the roles <actor>Ashley Judd</actor> usually lands herself in didn’t dissuade my optimism. Boy was I wrong.</p>\n\n<p><actor>Ashley Judd</actor> is <character>Jessica Shepard</character>, a Bay Area police officer who’s quite good at what she does. She’s just been promoted to inspector in the homicide division. Her mentor is <character>John Mills</character> (portrayed by <actor>Samuel Jackson</actor>) who also raised her after the death of her parents. It seems her father went on a killing spree which ended when he killed his wife, then committed suicide.</p>\n\n<p><character>Jessica</character> is assigned to see a departmental psychiatrist, <character>Dr. Frank</character> (portrayed by <actor>David Strathairn</actor>) after a bust where it’s believed she might have used excessive violence on the suspect. She doesn’t really think much of the sessions but does start to open up to the doctor as time progresses.</p>\n\n<p><character>Jessica</character>’s vice is that she picks up men in bars and has sex with them. It’s meaningless sex with strangers, and she doesn’t even seem to be enjoying it. She also drinks quite a bit, and soon begins having blackouts.</p>\n\n<p>Her new partner is <character>Mike Delmarco</character> (portrayed by <actor>Andy Garcia</actor>). The two are assigned a case and the body turns out to be that of one of <character>Jessica</character>’s lovers from more than a month prior. Soon another body turns up, also one of her former lovers. The crimes are connected through the manner of the death as well as a single cigarette burn on the back of the hand.</p>\n\n<p><character>Jessica</character> starts wondering if she’s starting to become like her father with a mental illness driving her to kill and if history is repeating itself in a sense.</p>\n\n<p>There were so many issues with <name>Twisted</name> that I hardly know where to start. The writing is absolutely horrid. There was little I found surprising or suspenseful in the script. Everything was tremendously predictable. The morning the second murder is discovered after <character>Jessica</character> has blacked out once again, she touches her face to find her finger is bleeding. I knew right away they would discover her blood on the victim, but that it was planted there. The story is entirely too obvious all the way along. At around the 40-minute point in the movie, it’s also made pretty obvious who the real killer is.</p>\n\n<p>It was also pretty obvious that her blackouts were drug-induced right from early on. If the audience can figure it out, I would think this crack inspector could as well.</p>\n\n<p>There were also plot holes aplenty throughout the film. Two partners who start to have feelings for each other, and yet they are allowed to remain working together? And in a case where one partner has had relationships with all the victims? No one on the force seems to care for <character>Jessica</character> except her partner and <character>John Mills</character>, although her supervisor <character>Lt. Tong</character> (portrayed by <actor>Russell Wong</actor>) seems to have some admiration for her ability to solve crimes and dedication. However, since the writing is so poor, I never got a feeling for what <character>Tong</character> really thought of <character>Jessica</character> as he’s terribly underused as a character.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the characters are so cardboard that I can’t really fault the actors, although all of the performances are terrible and wooden. Even the normally stellar <actor>Samuel Jackson</actor> seems like he’s only in the role half-heartedly. I can’t imagine what drew <actor>Andy Garcia</actor> to the role unless it was hacked to death from what it originally was. The entire story is completely unbelievable and contrived, and it seems like at some point the actors realized it and wondered what they were doing there.</p>\n\n<p><actor>Ashley Judd</actor> portrays the same character through most of the movies she makes. That’s the problem – all of the roles seem to be the same, and none are memorable. It’s the same character from <name>Kiss the Girls</name> and <name>Double Jeopardy</name>. I know she is capable of more, but I think she sometimes chooses scripts where the characters are too familiar.</p>\n\n<p>There’s some interesting cinematography, but that can’t rescue <name>Twisted</name> from a poor script. Despite the star power, this is a horrible disappointment and something that you don’t have to feel bad about missing, even if you are generally a fan of any of these actors.</p>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the relevant attributes of the movie \"Twisted\" while maintaining the original meaning and flow of the review.

It competed at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe Pledge is based on Friedrich Dürrenmatt's 1958 novella The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel. Dürrenmatt wrote the novella to refine the theme he originally developed in the screenplay for the 1958 German-language film It Happened in Broad Daylight with Heinz Rühmann.\n\n## Plot\n\nAging Reno, Nevada, police detective Jerry Black attends a retirement party hosted by his department during which Captain Pollack presents tickets to Jerry for a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime.\n\nJerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with an intellectual disability, is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry's suspicions.\n\nStill adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from Heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places it loved in life, before delivering it to God. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called \"The Giant\" shortly before she was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of \"The Giant\", but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him.\n\nJerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same modus operandi as seen with Ginny's, which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful.\n\nWhile fishing, Jerry notices a gas station near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (against whom Lori has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy and even begins a romance with Lori herself.\n\nOne day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station. Jerry suspects that Jackson is Ginny's killer after he invites Chrissy to his church. Jerry rushes to the church after Jackson picks her up one day while he is fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close call, and that Jackson is not the killer.\n\nMeanwhile, Chrissy meets a man who drives a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of Ginny's drawing that stood out to Jerry. That night, while reading her a bedtime story, Chrissy tells Jerry that she met a \"wizard\" who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell anyone about their interaction. (A later scene hints that the chocolates are laced with narcotics.) Chrissy tells Jerry she is supposed to meet the \"wizard\" again the next day at a nearby picnic area. Using Chrissy as bait, Jerry stages a sting operation with Stan's help to catch the killer. However, while on the way to the meeting, the \"wizard\" dies in a car accident; hours later, the SWAT team gives up and leaves Jerry alone. They inform Lori of what is happening. She confronts Jerry angrily about putting Chrissy in danger and breaks up with him.\n\nSometime later, Jerry sits by himself on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute, and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Jack Nicholson as Jerry Black\n- Patricia Clarkson as Margaret Larsen\n- Benicio del Toro as Toby Jay Wadenah\n- Aaron Eckhart as Stan Krolak\n- Helen Mirren as Doctor\n- Tom Noonan as Gary Jackson\n- Robin Wright Penn as Lori\n- Vanessa Redgrave as Annalise Hansen\n- Mickey Rourke as Jim Olstad\n- Sam Shepard as Eric Pollack\n- Harry Dean Stanton as Floyd Cage\n- Dale Dickey as Strom\n- Costas Mandylor as Monash Deputy\n- Michael O'Keefe as Duane Larsen\n- Lois Smith as Helen Jackson\n- Brittany Tiplady as Becky Fiske\n- Eileen Ryan as Jean\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was shot mainly on location in the British Columbia interior. While the opening scenes were filmed in Reno, Nevada, the rest of the film was shot in Keremeos, Princeton, Hedley, Merritt and Lytton, all in British Columbia. Tom Noonan recounts that, when Battlefield Earth flopped, the film's backers \"were so freaked out... that they got on Sean [Penn] about finishing on time and finishing under budget, which wasn't really possible, because they were shooting in the mountains, and there were four or five scenes that I still had to shoot, which they never shot, which explain who I am in that film. Because I'm not the guy who killed the kids. I'm not the bad guy in the film.\"[4] He has repeated this assertion: \"There's another guy who's in a Mercedes that gets burned at the end. And people tell me I look like the guy in the Mercedes but that's not me. I'm the nice guy in that movie. At least in the script, I am.\"[5]\n\n## Home video\n\nThe film was released on DVD and VHS on June 19, 2001.[6]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Pledge did not perform well at the box office. The film opened in 1,275 theaters and grossed $5,765,347, with an average of $4,521 per theater and ranking #11 at the box office. The film ultimately earned $19,733,089 domestically and $9,686,202 internationally for a total of $29,419,291, below its $35 million production budget.[7][8][9][10]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe Pledge received mainly positive reviews from critics. The film has a score of 78% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 6.88/10. The critical consensus states: \"Though its subject matter is grim and may make viewers queasy, The Pledge features an excellent, subtle performance by Jack Nicholson.\"[11] The film also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 33 critics.[12] Audiences polled by CinemaScore graded the film \"D\" on a scale of A+ to F.[13]\n\nJames Berardinelli gave The Pledge three out of five, calling it \"clever in the way that it gradually reveals things, but never gives us too much information at one time\".[14] Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four,[15] and in 2012 upgraded it to four stars and added it to his \"Great Movies\" list, writing, \"The last third of the movie is where most police stories go on autopilot, with obligatory chases, stalkings and confrontations. That's when The Pledge grows most compelling. Penn and Nicholson take risks with the material and elevate the movie to another, unanticipated, haunting level.\"[16]\n\n### Accolades\n\n- Sean Penn – Palme d'Or at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival[17] – NOMINATED\n- Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics – NOMINATED\n- 2002 for the Danish Bodil – NOMINATED\n- Benicio Del Toro – 2002 ALMA Award – NOMINATED\n- Brittany Tiplady – 2002 Young Artist Award – NOMINATED\n- Hans Zimmer – 2001 World Soundtrack Award – NOMINATED\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"THE PLEDGE (15)\".

The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime. Jerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with an intellectual disability, is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry's suspicions. Still adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from Heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places it loved in life, before delivering it to God. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called 'The Giant' shortly before she was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of 'The Giant', but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him. Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same modus operandi as seen with Ginny's, which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful. While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (against whom Lori has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy and even begins a romance with Lori herself. One day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station.

It stars Brenda Song, Mike Vogel, Dennis Haysbert, and Ashley Scott.[1][2]\n\nIt was released on July 18, 2019, by Netflix.[3]\n\n## Plot\n\nOn a rainy night, a woman (Brenda Song) flees down the street from an unknown pursuer. She is struck by a car, leaving her injured and unconscious. She wakes up in the hospital with amnesia, recalling nothing about the incident or her life prior. A man by her bedside (Mike Vogel) introduces himself as Russell Williams, her husband, and says that her name is Jennifer. To help her regain memories, he shows her photos of her life, telling her that her parents died in a fire two years ago, that she had quit her job, and that she rarely talks to her friends anymore.\n\nDetective Frank Page (Dennis Haysbert), obsessed with his work after failing to find his own daughter's kidnapper, investigates Jennifer's accident and grows suspicious of Russell, who drives a truck similar to one seen in the vicinity where Jennifer was hit. After Jennifer is discharged, Russell takes her to their secluded home. Jennifer is haunted by brief flashes of memories from the rainy night of her accident. She becomes uneasy by Russell's strange behavior and realizes that he has been locking her inside the house at night. She also notices that most of the photos in her home have been manipulated. Frank's investigation leads him to Jennifer's parents' home, where he finds their rotting corpses. He learns from Jennifer's former employer that \"Russell\" is actually Ryan Gaerity, a temperamental worker fired over two months ago.\n\nWhile Ryan is out, Jennifer finds her own ID in his wallet, which she uses to unlock his computer. She finds images of her actual husband Russell (Daniel Booko) and realizes the danger she's in. Before she can escape, Ryan knocks her unconscious and chains her to the bed while he goes out to get supplies. When he returns, the real Russell's corpse is revealed to be in his car trunk.\n\nFrank arrives at their home and tries to rescue Jennifer, but Ryan knocks him out, locking him in a freezer. He rants to Jennifer that he had loved her for years but her lack of reciprocation and marriage to Russell enraged him, leading him to kill Russell and take Jennifer for himself. Jennifer manages to escape into the forest with Ryan giving chase. Knowing that Jennifer will never love him, Ryan decides to kill her with his gun, but Frank tackles him before he can shoot her, and Jennifer takes the gun and shoots Ryan in the arm. A wounded Ryan desperately attempts to run towards Jennifer to retrieve the gun, but Jennifer fires another shot, ultimately killing Ryan.\n\nThree months later, Frank gives Jennifer a note from her late husband that he had found during the investigation. As she drives, leaving for San Jose, Russell's voice narrates the note, telling her how much he loves her.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Brenda Song as Jennifer Allen Williams\n- Mike Vogel as Ryan Gaerity / The fake Russell Williams\n- Dennis Haysbert as Detective Frank Page\n- Ashley Scott as Nurse Masters\n- Paul Sloan as Jim Kahn\n- Daniel Booko as The real Russell Williams\n- Scott Peat as Ray\n- Blair Hickey as Scott\n- Michael Patrick McGill as Captain Fitzpatrick\n- Casey Leach as Charlie Kimble\n- Jim Hanna as Dr. East\n- Ciarra Carter as Desk Nurse\n- Eric Etebari as Xander\n- Kati Salowsky as Cashier\n- Jennifer Peo as Mother\n\n## Production\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place on location in Pomona and Malibu, California, in 2018.[4][5][6]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was released on July 18, 2019 by Netflix.[3] On October 17, 2019, Netflix announced that the film had been viewed by over 40 million viewers after its release on their platform.[7]\n\n## Reception\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 29% based on 17 reviews, with an average of 2.8/10.

She wakes up in the hospital with amnesia, recalling nothing about the incident or her life prior. A man by her bedside (Mike Vogel) introduces himself as Russell Williams, her husband, and says that her name is Jennifer. To help her regain memories, he shows her photos of her life, telling her that her parents died in a fire two years ago, that she had quit her job, and that she rarely talks to her friends anymore. Detective Frank Page (Dennis Haysbert), obsessed with his work after failing to find his own daughter's kidnapper, investigates Jennifer's accident and grows suspicious of Russell, who drives a truck similar to one seen in the vicinity where Jennifer was hit. After Jennifer is discharged, Russell takes her to their secluded home. Jennifer is haunted by brief flashes of memories from the rainy night of her accident. She becomes uneasy by Russell's strange behavior and realizes that he has been locking her inside the house at night. She also notices that most of the photos in her home have been manipulated. Frank's investigation leads him to Jennifer's parents' home, where he finds their rotting corpses. He learns from Jennifer's former employer that 'Russell' is actually Ryan Gaerity, a temperamental worker fired over two months ago. While Ryan is out, Jennifer finds her own ID in his wallet, which she uses to unlock his computer. She finds images of her actual husband Russell (Daniel Booko) and realizes the danger she's in. Before she can escape, Ryan knocks her unconscious and chains her to the bed while he goes out to get supplies. When he returns, the real Russell's corpse is revealed to be in his car trunk. Frank arrives at their home and tries to rescue Jennifer, but Ryan knocks him out, locking him in a freezer. He rants to Jennifer that he had loved her for years but her lack of reciprocation and marriage to Russell enraged him, leading him to kill Russell and take Jennifer for himself. Jennifer manages to escape into the forest with Ryan giving chase. Knowing that Jennifer will never love him, Ryan decides to kill her with his gun, but Frank tackles him before he can shoot her, and Jennifer takes the gun and shoots Ryan in the arm. A wounded Ryan desperately attempts to run towards Jennifer to retrieve the gun, but Jennifer fires another shot, ultimately killing Ryan. Three months later, Frank gives Jennifer a note from her late husband that he had found during the investigation.

This not only impedes effective regulation of cosmetics but also leads to the continual infiltration of illegal products into the market, posing serious health risks to consumers. The establishment of cosmetic regulations is often based on extensive scientific experiments, resulting in a certain degree of latency. Therefore, timely advancement in laboratory research is crucial to ensure the timely update and adaptability of regulations. A comprehensive understanding of the composition of cosmetic matrices and their pretreatment technologies is vital for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of cosmetic detection. Drawing upon the China National Medical Products Administration’s 2021 Cosmetic Classification Rules and Classification Catalogue, we streamline the wide array of cosmetics into four principal categories based on the following compositions: emulsified, liquid, powdered, and wax-based cosmetics. In this review, the characteristics, compositional elements, and physicochemical properties inherent to each category, as well as an extensive overview of the evolution of pretreatment methods for different categories, will be explored. Our objective is to provide a clear and comprehensive guide, equipping researchers with profound insights into the core compositions and pretreatment methods of cosmetics, which will in turn advance cosmetic analysis and improve detection and regulatory approaches in the industry.\n\nKeywords: cosmetics, personal care products, compositions, pretreatment, detection, regulation\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nWith the development of the economy and people’s pursuit of beauty, the cosmetics industry has experienced significant growth [1,2]. Despite stringent regulations, such as China’s Cosmetic Safety Technical Specifications and the European Union’s Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009, which prohibit hazardous ingredients—including lead, mercury, arsenic, antibiotics, hormones, and carcinogens [3,4,5]—illicit products continue to infiltrate the market, posing potential dermatological risks and severe health hazards to consumers [6,7,8,9,10]. According to the China National Medical Products Administration, 601 batches of non-compliant cosmetics were detected in 2023, 79 of which contained unauthorized ingredients [11]. These products with illegal additives span various categories, including acne treatment cosmetics that were found with hormones like dexamethasone and clobetasol propionate and antibacterial drugs, such as clindamycin, lincomycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole. Similarly, hair care products contained preservatives like methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone, along with hair dye agents such as p-aminophenol and 2-chloro-phenylenediamine sulfate. Furthermore, face masks have been found to include hormones like desonide and flumethasone and nail polishes were found with prohibited solvents such as dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. In addition, skin lightening products have been found to contain hormone-like clobetasol propionate, and shampoos have been found to include the preservative triclosan. Even baby creams have been found to contain the illegal antifungal agent terbinafine. These illegal additives, while cost-effectively enhancing product claims, pose significant health and environmental risks.\n\nThe reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted. Primarily, commercial interests undeniably motivate manufacturers. Additionally, the intrinsic complexity of cosmetics poses significant challenges to detection, allowing dishonest merchants to exploit vulnerabilities. Cosmetic matrices, comprising a complex blend of preservatives, emulsifiers, and thickeners, necessitate effective pretreatment before analytical detection, especially given the diverse and minute quantities of illicit additives [12,13,14,15]. Although the selection of pretreatment techniques is not strictly constrained by the type of sample matrix, each matrix type has its most suitable pretreatment method. Consequently, an insufficient understanding of the compositions and properties of the matrices may lead to inappropriate pretreatment and inadequate enrichment of illegal additives. For instance, solid-phase extraction (SPE) has been employed in the pretreatment of various cosmetic products. However, SPE was initially developed as a complement or replacement for liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), making it more suited for the analysis of liquid cosmetics [16,17]. In the case of non-liquid cosmetics, it is imperative to consider the specific matrix composition of the sample and incorporate additional processing steps by which to circumvent issues such as column clogging, extended processing times, excessive solvent use, and low recovery rates [18]. Similarly, the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) method involves mixing the sample with dispersing and solid-phase extraction agents, followed by physical grinding to ensure thorough contact between the analytes and the solid-phase extractor. This method is primarily applicable to solid and semi-solid samples, rather than liquid cosmetics. Inappropriate selection of pretreatment methods can lead to reduced recovery rates, potentially resulting in illegal additives being omitted during detection and regulatory evasion. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the composition and characteristics of different cosmetic matrices is crucial when selecting appropriate pretreatment techniques and achieving effective regulation.\n\nThe current literature summarizes cosmetic pretreatment methods based primarily on the type of extraction method, meticulously detailing the evolution and optimization of various treatment techniques [17,18,19]. However, these articles often overlook a significant issue: the considerable differences in the matrix components of different cosmetic formulations, which hinders researchers from effectively selecting suitable pretreatment methods without a thorough understanding of the composition and properties of the cosmetic matrix. A rigorous scientific approach in this field should focus on the compatibility of both extraction methods and cosmetic ingredients. However, the multifaceted nature of cosmetics analysis, encompassing cosmetic science, pharmaceutical chemistry, and analytical chemistry, presents technical and informational gaps as hurdles, leading to a lack of comprehensive literature reviews that address matrix compositions and pretreatment techniques tailored to each cosmetic category. The Cosmetic Classification Rules and Classification Catalogue, introduced by the National Medical Products Administration of China in 2021 categorizes cosmetics into 12 types based on the following formulations: creams, liquids, gels, powders, solids, muds, waxes, sprays, aerosols, substrate-based cosmetics, freeze-dried cosmetics, and others (Figure 1) [20]. Our review condenses these into four primary categories based on composition and examines their matrix ingredients, key compounds, and physicochemical characteristics. We also summarize the advances in pretreatment methods for different categories that have been developed since 2005. The objective is to provide researchers with a detailed understanding of the various cosmetic matrices and aid in the refinement of pretreatment research. Such advancement is essential for enhancing the detection and monitoring of illegal additives, reinforcing the security of cosmetic products.\n\nClassification and compositions of cosmetic dosage forms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the compositions and representative compounds of cosmetics, in which we discuss the common and specific ingredients across different categories of cosmetics, along with their representative compounds. This section also delves into the mechanisms of action, physicochemical properties, additive thresholds, and pretreatment methods of these compounds.\n\nSection 3 presents advances in cosmetic pretreatment techniques, in which we delineate the evolution of pretreatment strategies for each cosmetic category since 2005. In the conclusion and the Future Perspectives Section, we synthesize the main content of this article and provide a prospective introduction to emerging pretreatment technologies, aiming to offer guidance and perspectives for future research.\n\n## 2. Compositions and Representative Compounds of Cosmetics\n\nIn the latest “classification rules”, many cosmetic forms share similar ingredients. Sprays and aerosols, for instance, are distinguished mainly by the presence of propellants, yet their base formulations are akin to liquid cosmetics [21]. Creams and gels characteristically contain significant quantities of humectants and thickeners, while powders, solids, and freeze-dried cosmetics predominantly feature powdery solids [22]. Considering that cosmetics with similar ingredients can use comparable pretreatment processes, this review proposes a categorization that simplifies 12 dosage forms into the following four primary categories: emulsified, liquid, powdered, and wax-based cosmetics, as depicted in Figure 1. This reclassification facilitates a clearer comprehension of the commonalities and distinctions within cosmetic matrices, thus fostering the innovation of targeted and efficient pretreatment techniques in cosmetic science.\n\n### 2.1. Common Ingredients in Cosmetic Formulations\n\nDespite the marked variations in the matrices of diverse cosmetics, the universal application of preservatives, antioxidants, pH adjusters, chelators, and fragrances pervades various cosmetic categories [22].\n\n#### 2.1.1. Preservatives\n\nPursuant to European Regulation 1223/2009, a preservative is defined as “any substance aimed at inhibiting the proliferation of microorganisms in cosmetics”, thus extending the product’s shelf life [18]. Common preservatives include parabens (compounds 1–3 in Figure 2), isothiazolinones (compounds 4–5), formaldehyde releasers (compounds 6–7), ether alcohols (compounds 8–10), and organic acids alongside their salts (compounds 11–15), as shown in Figure 2 [23]. Parabens, such as methyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben, are cost-effective and widely used for their antifungal and antibacterial properties, especially in rinse-off products [24]. Isothiazolinones, like methylisothiazolinone, offer broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and remain effective across diverse pH levels [25]. Formaldehyde releasers, including imidazolidinyl urea and dimethyloldimethyl hydantoin (DMDMH), ensure low levels of free formaldehyde, providing microbial protection [26]. Ether alcohols, such as chlorphenesin, 2-phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, pentanediol, hexanediol, and octanediol, recognized as gentler preservative alternatives, also offer broad-spectrum antibacterial benefits [27,28,29]. Organic acids and their salts, containing levulinic acid, anisic acid, sorbic acid/potassium sorbate, and benzoic acid/sodium benzoate, although less effective against bacteria, inhibit fungi and are often used in combination with other substances like hydantoin for enhanced preservation [30,31].\n\nKey preservatives utilized in cosmetic formulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nParabens (compounds 1–3) feature a planar benzene ring structure, which facilitates interactions with microbial cell membranes. The ester groups (methyl, ethyl, or propyl) exhibit increased lipophilicity with longer carbon chain lengths, enhancing their ability to penetrate cell membranes and improving their preservative efficacy. The hydroxyl groups primarily enhance water solubility, aiding in the dispersion of these compounds in cosmetic products and diffusion within microbial cells. Additionally, isothiazolinones (compounds 4–5), containing a five-membered isothiazolone ring with sulfur and nitrogen, can react with intracellular biomolecules such as proteins and enzymes, thereby disrupting the normal functions of microbial cells. Moreover, ether alcohol (compounds 8–10), typically containing an ether group (-O-) and one or more hydroxyl groups (-OH), exhibit a balance of hydrophilicity and lipophilicity. This unique structure facilitates the penetration of microbial cell membranes and disrupts cellular metabolic processes, which contributes to their bactericidal action. These compounds can also interact with the lipids in cell membranes, leading to membrane disruption and leakage of cellular contents. Finally, the preservative activity of organic acids and their salts (compounds 11–15) is primarily achieved by altering the pH within microbial cells, thereby disrupting their metabolic processes. Undissociated organic acids penetrate microbial cell membranes and dissociate within the cell due to the higher internal pH, releasing protons and acidifying the internal environment. The salt forms of organic acids, typically more water-soluble than the acids themselves, are more suitable as preservatives in aqueous formulations.\n\nThe structures of these compounds not only impart unique functionalities but also determine their individual solubility characteristics. Parabens, ethers, and isothiazolinones are predominantly lipid- and organic-solvent soluble, whereas formaldehyde releasers, alcohols, and organic acids demonstrate enhanced water solubility. This variance underscores the importance of suitable pretreatment techniques in different cosmetic detection.\n\n#### 2.1.2. Antioxidants\n\nThe complexity of cosmetic formulations, with their oxidization-prone components, such as lipids, requires an antioxidant system for quality preservation and product stability [32]. Antioxidants, as shown in Figure 3, are broadly categorized into synthetic and natural types [33,34,35]. Synthetic antioxidants (compounds 16–19), such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), tertiary-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), and propyl gallate, are engineered in the laboratory to effectively inhibit oxidative damage from light, heat, or metals. In contrast, natural antioxidants (compounds 20–24)—sourced mainly from plants, fruits, or other biological origins—include vitamin E, vitamin C, superoxide dismutase (SOD), coenzyme Q10, and other compounds, such as curcumin, astaxanthin, resveratrol, glutathione, rosemary extracts, and various flavonoids.\n\nPrincipal antioxidants in cosmetic formulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmong these antioxidants, compounds 16–22, which contain phenolic hydroxyl groups, are capable of capturing lipid free radicals, thereby disrupting lipid peroxidation processes [36]. These groups impart water solubility to these compounds. However, their solubility in organic solvents, such as ethanol, xylene, and chloroform, can be enhanced by increasing the number of hydroxyl groups or modifying the substituents on the phenyl ring. Compounds 23 and 24, characterized by their long-chain polyconjugated systems, are effective at neutralizing singlet oxygen and free radicals, consequently reducing oxidative stress [37]. Additionally, their long carbon chain structures confer increased lipophilicity. Notably, vitamin C’s high antioxidant capacity is tempered by its instability and potential skin irritancy, prompting the use of its derivatives in cosmetic products.\n\n#### 2.1.3. pH Adjusters\n\nMost cosmetic products have a pH range between 4.0 and 8.5. The distinct acid–base properties of certain ingredients necessitate the use of pH adjusters to maintain the pH within this desired range [38,39]. Common pH adjusters include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), triethanolamine, citric acid, sodium citrate, succinic acid, disodium succinate, and potassium phosphates (compounds 25–30 in Figure 4) [40,41]. Certain components, such as the high-molecular-weight thickener carbopol, require specific pH conditions to function optimally. In this case, an alkaline pH adjuster is needed for effective thickening. With advances in material technology, there is now a diverse selection of over a hundred thickening agents available. pH adjusters are thus essential for the stability, safety, and performance of cosmetic products.\n\nPredominant pH adjusters, chelators, and fragrances in cosmetic matrices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNaOH and KOH, as strong alkaline substances, effectively neutralize acidic components and are commonly used in products requiring higher pH levels, such as soaps and facial cleansers. In contrast, triethanolamine, a weaker base, is primarily used to reduce the pH of products to more closely match the skin’s natural pH, making it more suitable for use in skin care products. Additionally, citric acid, sodium citrate, succinic acid, and disodium succinate are often combined as buffering agents to regulate and maintain the pH in formulations with specific pH requirements. NaOH, KOH, and sodium citrate dissociate into ions in water, while triethanolamine and citric acid can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Consequently, these pH adjusters exhibit good water solubility.\n\n#### 2.1.4. Chelators\n\nChelators are crucial in cosmetics for binding metal ions, preventing deleterious interactions with other ingredients, and enhancing product stability and longevity [42,43]. Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a common chelator that not only effectively immobilizes various metal ions but also exhibits a synergistic interplay with preservatives and antioxidants. Although allergic responses are undocumented, disodium EDTA may facilitate skin penetration because of its low molecular weight, which could disrupt the metal ion balance in the body and cause irritation or other negative effects [44]. Other notable chelators include citric acid and phosphoric acid (compounds 31–33 in Figure 4).\n\nChelators possess chemical structures capable of forming multiple coordination bonds with metal ions. For example, disodium EDTA, with its four carboxyl and two amino groups, establishes six-point coordination, forming stable cyclic structures with metal ions. Similarly, citric acid forms multipoint coordination via its three carboxyl and one hydroxyl groups. These functional groups significantly contribute to their water solubility.\n\n#### 2.1.5. Fragrances\n\nCosmetic matrices incorporate fragrances to impart a desirable scent. These fragrances are broadly classified into natural and synthetic categories [45]. Natural fragrances, sourced from botanical and zoological materials, such as petals, leaves, roots, fruits, resins, and animal-derived essences, endow products with authentic scents. In contrast, synthetic fragrances, engineered in laboratories, have complex compositions formed by combining various chemical structures [46]. The Catalogue of Cosmetic Ingredients in Use (2021 Edition) lists only four substances explicitly as fragrances: flavor (06156), aroma (07007), parfum (07008), and fragrance (08782). It also lists compounds, including linalool, vanillin, cinnamaldehyde, and eugenol, that can be used as fragrances (compounds 34–37 in Figure 4) [47].\n\nCosmetic products encompass not only common ingredients, such as preservatives, antioxidants, pH adjusters, chelators, and fragrances, but also specific ingredients that impart distinctive properties and effects to each product. In pretreatment research, it is imperative to consider these ingredients to ensure the precision and efficiency of the research process. This review proceeds to delineate four cosmetic formulation categories, detailing their respective compositional nuances.\n\n### 2.2. Emulsified Cosmetics\n\nEmulsified cosmetic categories—encompassing creams, gels, and muds—are the primary vehicles for various skincare formulations such as face creams, facial cleansers, and aloe vera gels. These matrices are intricate, consisting of oils, aqueous phases, emulsifiers, humectants, and thickeners, in addition to their common ingredients [48,49]. The synergistic interplay of these ingredients determines the specific properties and performance efficacy of emulsified cosmetics.\n\n#### 2.2.1. Oils\n\nOil-based ingredients confer softness, lubricity, and spreadability to emulsified cosmetics, primarily consisting of plant oils such as shea, olive, and grape seed oil (compound 38 in Figure 5); animal fats such as lanolin and beeswax; mineral fats such as petrolatum (compound 39); synthetic fats, including isopropyl palmitate and caprylic/capric triglyceride (compounds 40–42); silicones, notably, polydimethylsiloxane; and fatty alcohols such as lecithin, squalane, and cetylicalcohol (compounds 43–45), as shown in Figure 5 [50,51,52,53].\n\nKey oil-based constituents in cosmetic formulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOil-based ingredients feature long carbon chains, which enhance their lipophilicity, allowing for effective integration with other non-polar substances. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of the long carbon chains in these oil-based ingredients aids in forming a protective layer on the skin surface, inhibiting moisture evaporation, and thereby serving a crucial lubricating function in cosmetic products [54,55]. These ingredients are soluble in nonpolar solvents such as alkanes meaning that n-hexane or petroleum ether are suitable solvents for their extraction during pretreatment.\n\n#### 2.2.2. Aqueous Phases\n\nDeionized water is the most common aqueous phase in cosmetics, primarily dissolving water-soluble preservatives, antioxidants, and active agents such as botanical extracts, fermentation broths, and enzymatic formulations [56]. The International Cosmetic Ingredient Standard Chinese Name Catalog (2010) mainly lists thermal spring water and seawater among its entries. However, niche waters, including deep sea [57] and glacial varieties [58], have recently entered the market, and are desired for their rich mineral contents and potential soothing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties.\n\n#### 2.2.3. Emulsifiers\n\nEmulsifiers are crucial for stabilizing emulsified cosmetics, with their selection depending on factors such as their oil-to-water ratios, hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) values, and critical packing parameters [59,60]. Prominent emulsifiers include Tween and Span, specifically, Tween 60 for oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions and Span 60 for water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions (compounds 46–47 in Figure 6); fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ethers such as stearyl alcohol polyether-2 and polyethylene glycol octadecyl ether (compounds 48–49); glycerides such as polyoxyethylene stearate and glycerine monostearate (compound 50); polyglycerines such as polyglyceryl-10 derivatives (compound 51); anionic types such as sodium aliphatic alcohol sulfate (compound 52); and saccharide derivatives, exemplified by MontanovTM 202 and 82 (compound 53), as shown in Figure 6 [61,62,63].\n\nCentral emulsifying agents in cosmetic preparations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmulsifiers are characterized by their amphiphilic nature, with the hydrophilic portion typically comprising polar functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (compounds 46–51), carboxyl groups, or charged groups (compound 52). Conversely, the hydrophobic part usually consists of non-polar structures, such as long carbon chains (compounds 46–50) or hydrophobic cyclic structures (compound 53). The amphiphilic nature of emulsifiers contributes to their emulsion stability but also presents challenges in cosmetic pretreatment [64]. Their complex structures and high molecular weights make gel chromatography a suitable method for their separation and removal, which is particularly effective for analytes with lower molecular weights [65,66].\n\n#### 2.2.4. Humectants\n\nHumectants, such as polyols like glycerin, butylene glycol, and panthenol; natural skin components, such as sodium hyaluronate, trehalose and ceramides; and amino acid derivatives, including betaine, sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid and sodium lactate [67,68] (compounds 54–63 in Figure 7), are essential for retaining moisture, preventing desiccation, and maintaining the skin’s hydration equilibrium [69].\n\nProminent humectants and thickeners employed in cosmetic matrices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHumectants contain multiple hydroxyl, carboxyl, or other polar groups, which can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby absorbing and retaining moisture. Low molecular weight humectants (compounds 54–61) can penetrate the skin, providing hydration to deeper layers. In contrast, high molecular weight humectants, such as sodium hyaluronate (compound 62), form a hydrating film on the skin surface, effectively locking in moisture and reducing water loss. Humectants can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and also engage in intermolecular hydrogen bonding, endowing them with unique water solubility, high melting and boiling points, and significant viscosity [70]. During the pretreatment process, liquid–liquid extraction methods can be employed to separate these humectants from the liquid cosmetics.\n\n#### 2.2.5. Thickeners\n\nThe texture of emulsified cosmetic formulations is largely influenced by thickeners, which are second only to solvents in terms of quantity [71]. Thickeners are categorized by their functional groups: inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and sodium phosphate; fatty alcohols and acids, including lauryl and myristyl alcohols, as well as linolenic acid (compounds 64–66); alkanolamides, such as coconut monoethanolamide and linoleic acid diethanolamide (compounds 67–68); ethers, such as polyethylene glycol monocetyl ether (compound 69); esters, such as isostearate and cetyl palmitate (compound 70); oxidized amines, such as myristyl dimethylamine oxide (compound 71); amphoteric surfactants, including cocamidopropyl and hexadecyl betaine (compound 72); anionic surfactants, such as potassium oleate (compound 73); cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose and its gums (compound 74); natural gums and modified gums, such as alginates and guar gum (compound 75); and inorganic polymers and their derivatives, for instance, magnesium aluminum silicate, montmorillonite, and hectorite (compound 76), as shown in Figure 7 [72,73,74,75].\n\nMost thickeners are composed of long carbon chains, along with polar groups such as hydroxyl (compounds 64, 65, 69), carboxyl (compounds 66, 75), and amide groups (compounds 67, 68). These long-chain structures intertwine within solutions, increasing the solution’s resistance to flow and thereby enhancing its viscosity. Additionally, the polar groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, further enhancing the water’s viscosity. Thickeners can be categorized into two main types based on their solubility: water-soluble and oil-soluble [76,77]. Water-soluble thickeners are primarily composed of polar groups, whereas oil-soluble thickeners contain long carbon chains. In the pretreatment research of cosmetics, the selection of an appropriate solvent depends on the specific type of thickener used.\n\n### 2.3. Liquid Cosmetics\n\nIn this context, liquid cosmetics refer to products without emulsifiers and exhibit significant fluidity, including liquids, sprays, aerosols, and substrate-based cosmetics, such as shampoos, perfumes, nail polishes, and facial masks. The compositions of these products are relatively uncomplicated, primarily comprising common ingredients, solvents, and humectants, as well as propellants, which are characteristic of spray products.\n\n#### 2.3.1. Solvents\n\nSolvents are essential in the formulation of liquid cosmetics, as they dissolve active ingredients and enhance product fluidity. Commonly used solvents include water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, toluene, oils, and botanical extracts [78,79,80,81,82]. Water is often preferred due to its low cost and high solvency. Ethanol is effective in dissolving oils, fragrances, and plant-derived ingredients and is frequently used with water to leverage its antimicrobial properties. Ethyl acetate and toluene are staples in nail polish, though concerns about toluene’s irritation potential have led to its decreased use and regulatory restrictions internationally [83]. Oils and plant extracts are selected not only for their solvency but also for their additional benefits to the product.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Propellants\n\nPropellants are essential for the ejection of contents from aerosol containers, such as hairspray. Common propellants include propane, butane, isobutane, and environmentally friendly options such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen [84,85]. The use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) is severely restricted because of their ozone-depleting effects [86,87]. Consequently, the choice of propellants is dictated not only by the specific needs of the product but also by stringent regional environmental regulations.\n\n### 2.4. Powdered Cosmetics\n\nPowdered cosmetics encompass powders, solids, and freeze-dried cosmetics such as body powders, pressed powders, and blushes. These products are formulated with binders, slip agents, fillers, and colorants, in addition to their common ingredients, which collectively determine the texture, appearance, and performance of the cosmetic item [88].\n\n#### 2.4.1. Binders\n\nIn powdered cosmetics, binders are essential for combining slip agents, fillers, colorants, and other materials into a cohesive product [89]. Natural binders, such as beeswax and keratin, not only help to hold the product together but also provide antimicrobial benefits. Oleophilic binders, such as liquid paraffin and silicone oils, are chosen for their ability to enhance the smoothness of application and to stabilize the particles. Synthetic binders, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), are favored for their strong cohesive properties and for imparting a flexible and sleek texture to the final product [90,91].\n\n#### 2.4.2. Slip Agents\n\nIn powdered cosmetic formulations, slip agents, such as sorbitan esters, propylene glycol, and PEG-8, play a crucial role in improving texture and facilitating smooth application. These ingredients help to optimize powder dispersion, prevent the excessive cohesion of particles, and reduce the likelihood of caking, thereby promoting an even application and imparting a silky feel to the skin [92]. Due to their hygroscopic properties, which allow them to attract and retain moisture, they also contribute to maintaining skin hydration [93].\n\n#### 2.4.3. Fillers\n\nIn powdered cosmetics, fillers, such as mica, kaolin, calcium carbonate, talc, silica, pearl, and nylon, are used to modulate color intensity, increase volume, and enhance texture. These substances confer beneficial characteristics, such as sheen for visual appeal, silkiness for a smooth touch, oil absorption for longer wear, and soft-focus effects for a flattering finish [94,95]. However, their chemical stability and low solubility can pose challenges during pretreatment processing, as these properties may necessitate specialized techniques for their dispersion and dissolution.\n\n#### 2.4.4. Colorants\n\nColorants are pivotal in powdered cosmetics for providing hue and are categorized as organic or inorganic. Organic colorants encompass plant-based pigments, synthetic dyes, and lakes, which are dyes deposited onto substrates. In contrast, inorganic colorants, such as iron oxides, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and mica, are often preferred in such formulations for their stability, minimal skin irritation, and ability to provide opacity and coverage [96,97]. These inorganic options are favored not only for their consistent coloration but also for their safety profile and non-irritating nature, ensuring both product efficacy and consumer comfort [98].\n\n### 2.5. Wax-Based Cosmetics\n\nWax-based cosmetics are products that incorporate the waxes, such as carnauba, candelilla, jojoba, bees, and Japan waxes, that are essential for enhancing stability, controlling viscosity, and ensuring a non-tacky feel [99]. Carnauba wax is particularly prized in color cosmetics for its excellent thickening and stabilizing abilities. Candelilla wax is treasured for its natural composition, contributing to product consistency and a refined texture. Jojoba wax is recognized for its remarkable stability and resistance to oxidation, making it a versatile choice for a variety of wax-based products. Beeswax is widely used for its inherent stability and antimicrobial properties, making it a staple in color cosmetics as well as skincare preparations [100,101,102,103]. The pronounced hydrophobic properties of wax signify its insolubility in water. However, wax is only soluble in certain organic solvents, such as chloroform, mineral oil, or certain alcohols. Additionally, the inherent viscosity of wax further complicates its pretreatment process.\n\n### 2.6. Thresholds for Cosmetic Ingredient Additions\n\nCosmetics, as complex mixtures composed of various ingredients, benefit from an understanding of their approximate compositional ranges to optimize pretreatment and analytical conditions. For instance, in the application of preservatives, chlorphenesin (compound 8) is permitted at a maximum concentration of 0.3%, whereas 1,2-pentanediol (compound 10) can reach up to 21.29% in the highest historical usage for residency category products. Awareness of such information is crucial when identifying and mitigating potential interferences during pretreatment and analysis. We conducted a thorough inquiry into the additional ranges of each substance mentioned in the aforementioned section. Acknowledging that different countries and regulations may vary in their requirements for the same substance, our initial references were the European Union regulations (EC) No 1223/2009 [104] and Commission Regulation (EU) 2022/2195 [105], followed by the Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics of China (2015 Edition) [106] and the Cosmetics Ingredients Catalog used in China (2021 edition) [107]. Additionally, we consulted data from several professional websites (Table 1).\n\n#### Table 1.\n\nThresholds for cosmetic ingredient additions.\n\n| Ingredients                     | Thresholds                                                             | Ingredients                  | Thresholds            | Ingredients                              | Thresholds               | Ingredients                              | Thresholds                      | Ingredients       | Thresholds                                |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Preservatives                   |                                                                        | Ubidecarenone (24)           | N.D.

Illegal Additives in Cosmetics\n\nBeyond the complexity of their matrices, cosmetics also present intricate challenges due to the illegal additives incorporated into them. In China, the “Prohibited Ingredients Catalogue for Cosmetics” and the “Prohibited Plant and Animal Materials Catalogue in Cosmetics” cumulatively prohibit the use of 1393 ingredients [125], while the European Union’s EC No. 1223/2009 regulation lists 1328 banned substances [104]. However, the actual number of illicitly added ingredients far exceeds those enumerated in these directories. The reasons for this are multifaceted. Firstly, all compounds with similar functions are uniformly classified under the same category, such as “antibiotics” and “substances with androgenic effect”. Secondly, derivatives and salts of certain compounds are also grouped together, for instance, “aniline, its salts and its halogenated and sulphonated derivatives”. Lastly, these prohibitory lists are continuously updated, not only adding new banned substances but also shifting the status of certain ingredients from prohibited to restricted. These factors collectively amplify the complexity and challenges in the regulation of cosmetics.\n\nThe utilization of illegal additives in cosmetics is driven by a myriad of complex factors. Initially, some manufacturers might opt for prohibited, lower-cost chemical substances as substitutes for expensive, yet safe, ingredients. For instance, illegal additives N-(5-Chlorobenzoxazol-2-yl)acetamide and alkyne alcohols are inexpensive and have antimicrobial and antiseptic effects. Additionally, substances like benzidine, antimony, arsenic, and xylidines, despite their pigmentary properties and lower costs, are employed as alternative pigments. Furthermore, certain illegal additives are incorporated into cosmetics to augment product efficacy. Medications originally intended for anxiety and insomnia treatment, such as carbromal, isocarboxazid, benzazepines, and bromisoval, might be illicitly added to products like frankincense, essential oils, and skincare items for their sedative effects. Hypoglycemic drugs like tolbutamide, carbutamide, and sulfonylurea derivatives, due to their ability to reduce sugar absorption and consequently aid in weight loss, are sometimes used in slimming cosmetics. Spironolactone, an anti-androgen medication, can decrease sebum production, aiding in acne control. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as antibiotics, aminocaproic acid, cinchophen, epinephrine, and mofebutazone, can alleviate skin inflammation and swelling. Trichloroacetic acid, used for exfoliating old skin layers and mitigating hyperpigmentation, is commonly found in acne and skin whitening products. While these drugs possess specific therapeutic effects, their use should be strictly regulated in medical contexts and never added to cosmetics without authorization. Nonetheless, some unscrupulous businesses might incorporate these substances into their products to enhance effectiveness, reduce costs, and increase profit margins. Lastly, the presence of certain illegal additives might result from technical flaws in the production process rather than intentional inclusion. For example, heavy metal contaminants, like lead, mercury, cadmium, and residual solvents, such as anthracene oil and benzene. Although unintentional, these instances pose potential health risks to consumers and thus necessitate stringent regulation.\n\n### 2.8. Analytical Technologies in Cosmetics\n\nThe diversity of illegal additives determines the crucial role of selecting appropriate analytical technologies. Ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (UV/VIS) primarily operates on the principle of substance absorption of ultraviolet or visible light, utilizing absorption spectra for the analysis of compounds. It is particularly applicable to organic compounds capable of absorbing UV or visible light, such as dyes and sunscreens in cosmetics [126]. Infrared spectroscopy (IR), conversely, is based on the principle of the molecular absorption of specific frequencies of infrared light, causing changes in vibrational energy levels. This method is suitable for both organic and inorganic compounds containing chemical bonds, frequently used in the analysis of lipids, fragrances, and moisturizers in cosmetics [127]. Mass spectrometry (MS) identifies molecular mass and composition by measuring the trajectory of molecules in electric or magnetic fields, applicable to nearly all compounds and particularly suited for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of complex cosmetic components [128]. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) leverages the absorption and emission of radio waves by atomic nuclei in an external magnetic field, applicable to organic compounds containing active nuclei (such as 1H, 13C), and is instrumental in analyzing the structure of complex organic compounds in cosmetics [129]. Gas chromatography (GC) employs gas as the mobile phase and separates components through a stationary phase in a chromatography column, ideal for volatile and thermally stable organic compounds like fragrances and solvents in cosmetics [130]. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) uses a liquid as the mobile phase under high pressure to separate components, is extensively applicable to various organic compounds, including high molecular weight and non-volatile substances, and is used for detecting and analyzing moisturizers, preservatives, vitamins, and other components in cosmetics [131]. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is based on the absorption of specific wavelengths of light by atomic vapor and is used for the analysis of metal elements and some metal compounds, such as heavy metal impurities (like lead or mercury) in cosmetics [132]. Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS) relies on the fluorescence generated by atoms transitioning between ground and excited states, is primarily used for trace element analysis (such as mercury, arsenic or selenium) and is applicable to the detection of trace harmful elements in cosmetics [133].\n\nThese techniques play a vital role in the analysis of cosmetics, ensuring product quality and safety, and aiding in the development of new products. Given the considerable variation in components across different types of cosmetics, selecting appropriate analytical techniques is crucial for the accurate identification and quantification of these components.\n\nIn Section 2, we discuss the common ingredients and the specific components of four different types of cosmetic products, along with their mechanisms of action, addition thresholds, and pretreatment methods. For instance, parabens, widely used as preservatives in cosmetics, owe their microbial growth inhibition properties to their phenolic structure, while their ester-linked carbon chains enhance the ability to penetrate cell membranes. The combined effects of these groups endow these compounds with lipophilicity. Another category of commonly used preservatives, organic acids and their salts, exhibit high water solubility due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds with water or to dissociate into ions in water. Additionally, we provide a brief introduction to common illegal additives and analytical techniques. Selecting appropriate pretreatment techniques based on the type of cosmetic and specific components is crucial for a more efficient removal of the cosmetic matrix, aiding in the separation and enrichment of analytes such as illegal additives and restricted compounds. Thus, the following section will summarize the pretreatment methods applicable to different types of cosmetic products.\n\n## 3. Advances in Cosmetic Pretreatment Techniques\n\nThe diversity of cosmetic matrices requires appropriate pretreatment methods. For emulsified cosmetics rich in emulsifiers and thickeners, techniques such as field-assisted extraction, which utilizes oscillation or microwave-assisted heating, and supercritical fluid extraction, often with CO2, are preferred [134]. Conversely, liquid cosmetics with simpler matrices benefit from phase separation techniques such as liquid–liquid extraction [135,136]. Aqueous extraction is ideal for products rich in polar compounds, while headspace analysis is best suited for isolating volatile constituents [137]. This review delineates the evolution of pretreatment strategies for diverse cosmetic categories since 2005. The advantages, disadvantages, and applicable matrices of the pretreatment techniques discussed in this article are briefly summarized in Table 2.\n\n### 3.1. Emulsified Cosmetics\n\nEmulsified cosmetics, with their intricate matrices of thickeners and emulsifiers, often present challenges in traditional solvent dissolution, resulting in suboptimal analyte recovery. In 2012, Zhong et al. [134] addressed this by employing ultrasound-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersive liquid extraction (UA–MSPD), which utilizes anhydrous sodium sulfite to disperse hair dyes, facilitating the extraction of analytes into an acidic medium. Concurrently, oil-based substances and thickeners are solubilized in n-hexane, with adsorbents capturing interfering compounds. This study innovatively employs dispersants to effectively disperse viscous hair dyes, thereby significantly simplifying the operational process. The method requires only 9 min to complete the entire procedure and demonstrates a high recovery rate, ranging from 85.7% to 107%.\n\nSolid-phase extraction (SPE), a traditional preparation technique, faces limitations when applied to emulsified cosmetics due to mass transfer resistance, which can lead to longer elution times and higher solvent consumption. In 2014, Zhan et al. [5] introduced an improved approach known as dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE). This method is initiated by suspending the cosmetic in acetonitrile. Subsequently, C18 silica is added as an adsorbent, and MgSO4 is employed to facilitate the dispersion of the matrix, followed by vigorous shaking and cotton filtration. The use of dispersants in conjunction with cotton filtration effectively eliminates interference from complex sample matrices in analytical results, streamlining the extraction process. This approach demonstrates excellent linearity for concentrations of up to 480 g/kg, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.982 to 0.999.\n\nBimatoprost and latanoprost, as first-line pharmacological agents for glaucoma treatment, have been determined to induce hypertrichosis as a side effect. Unscrupulous cosmetic manufacturers exploit this adverse effect by incorporating these drugs into eyelash growth serums. Prolonged exposure to cosmetics containing prostaglandin drugs can potentially lead to local skin or ocular discomfort, allergic reactions, and even impact cardiovascular health. Compared with traditional extraction methods, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) demonstrates superior efficiency, gentleness, and environmental friendliness. It effectively extracts active ingredients from complex matrices while preserving the stability of thermosensitive substances. In 2023, Yong et al. [129] applied UAE technology to process commercially available eyelash serums, followed by separation and purification using silica gel columns. Employing the Cosmetic Risk Substance Screening Platform, they detected suspicious components in two different fractions. These components were further purified using high-performance liquid chromatography and identified as bimatoprost and latanoprost through high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This extraction method exhibited an excellent linear range from 0.25–50 ng/mL (R2 &gt; 0.9992), with notably low detection (LOD) and quantitation limits (LOQ) of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively.\n\nFullerene, a nanomaterial composed of carbon atoms, is utilized in the cosmetics industry due to its exceptional antioxidative properties. However, given its status as an emerging nanomaterial, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of its potential impacts and safety. Liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), a common separation technique, often struggles with emulsified cosmetics due to stable emulsions formed by emulsifiers and surfactants, which resist phase separation [64]. In 2006, Xia et al. [138] improved this method by incorporating acetic acid, which effectively dissolves these challenging components, thereby enhancing the recovery of fullerenes from facial creams and serums. This modified approach successfully overcomes the emulsification challenges that typically impede traditional liquid–liquid extraction methods.\n\n### 3.2. Liquid Cosmetics\n\nLiquid cosmetics, with their relatively simple matrix, are well-suited to a variety of extraction techniques, thanks to the minimal risk of emulsification and column clogging. Applicable techniques include LLE, cloud point extraction (CPE), SPE, and stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) [139].\n\nLiquid–liquid extraction is a favored method in analytical chemistry for its efficiency and simplicity [135]. Certain water-compatible organic solvents can separate into two distinct phases in the presence of inorganic salts. Cai et al. [136] efficiently isolated phthalates from cosmetic waters and perfumes using this method, which is notably straightforward, achieves rapid partition equilibrium, and integrates seamlessly with HPLC analysis. CPE, another efficient technique, employs surfactant micellization for phase separation [140,141]. In 2011, Soruraddin et al. [142] utilized this method in treating shampoo with sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, subsequently warming it to 40 °C and adding 0.5% phenol to induce micelle formation, enabling the spectrophotometric determination of trace selenium (IV) within the micellar phase of Triton X-100. This study employs an economical and environmentally friendly approach, utilizing temperature elevation to the cloud point to form micelles, thereby achieving biphasic separation. This method is straightforward in operation, with a recovery rate ranging from 98% to 102%. Additionally, co-precipitation-assisted cloud point extraction enhances this technique by using co-precipitants for better analyte extraction. In 2013, Xiao et al. [143] combined aluminum hydroxide co-precipitation with sodium dodecyl sulfate-mediated cloud point extraction to effectively isolate and extract five estrogens from toners (17β-estradiol, estrone, ethinyl estradiol, diethyl stilbestrol, and dihydro stilbestrol). Similar to CPE, this study enhances the enrichment and separation of target analytes during cloud point extraction by incorporating coprecipitants to form precipitates with the analytes. Applied to the extraction of estrogens in cosmetics, this method achieves a recovery rate ranging from 77.3% to 104.1%.\n\nSPE is extensively utilized in food safety, pharmaceutical analysis, and biomedicine, using common adsorbents like diatomaceous earth, alumina, silica, and C18 and C8 silicas [144,145]. Recently, innovative adsorbents have been developed, such as nitrated garlic skin [146], corn fibers [147], molecularly imprinted polymers [148], artificial antibodies [149], and magnetic SPE. In 2020, Zhao et al. [150] developed a technique for detecting four steroids (ethinylestradiol, norgestrel, megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate) in shampoo, employing a deep-eutectic-solvent-based magnetic colloidal gel (DES–MCG) in magnetic SPE. They synthesized a DES–MCG adsorbent using a choline chloride–urea deep eutectic solvent with magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MMWCNTs). This novel adsorbent was used to extract analytes from concentrated shampoos, achieving recoveries ranging from 80.1% to 118.8%. This method integrates deep eutectic solvents with MMWCNTs, not only optimizing the sample processing procedure but also enhancing the recovery rate. Moreover, it exhibits superior environmental friendliness, aligning with the requirements of green analytical chemistry.\n\nParabens, common preservatives in cosmetics, are limited by the EU to a maximum concentration of 0.8% (w/w) in products. Traditional SPE suffers from low selectivity, often resulting in the co-extraction of various matrix components, adversely affecting the quantitative analysis of analytes. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) are synthetic materials capable of selectively interacting with specific chemical functional groups. Utilizing MIPs that selectively bind parabens enhances the selectivity of SPE. In 2018, Vicario et al. [151] synthesized MIPs using propylparaben as a template. They employed MIP-based solid-phase extraction (MISPE) for pretreatment of commercially available baby wipes, followed by analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method, demonstrating an over 86.15% recovery rate, showed greater selectivity, stability, and improved retention capabilities compared to traditional SPE methods.\n\nAcrylamide, a compound capable of forming covalent bonds with macromolecules such as proteins and DNA, is known to induce mutations and has potential carcinogenic effects. The presence of amino acids and sugars in cosmetic ingredients can lead to the formation of acrylamide during processing. Consequently, monitoring and controlling the content of acrylamide in cosmetics is of paramount importance. In 2023, Schettino et al. [13] utilized vortex-assisted reverse-phase dispersive liquid phase microextraction (LPME), employing water as the extraction solvent, to successfully extract and pre-concentrate acrylamide from liquid hand soaps and makeup removers. Subsequent analysis of the extracted acrylamide was conducted using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). This method, upon validation, demonstrated excellent analytical performance, including linearity, detection and quantification limits, with a recovery rate of 88–108%. Efficient, simple, and rapid, this method precisely quantifies trace levels of acrylamide, providing a robust tool for assessing the safety of cosmetics.\n\n### 3.3. Powdered Cosmetics\n\nPowdered cosmetics, rich in minerals that are largely insoluble in conventional solvents, present challenges in pretreatment. In 2010, Cha et al. [152] tackled this by using a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids for mineral decomposition via microwave digestion, which enabled the quantitative analysis of six metals—iron, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, and cadmium—in various cosmetic products using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Microwave digestion involves heating a sample with a strong acid inside a closed vessel using microwave radiation. This process significantly speeds up the digestion process, allowing for the efficient breakdown of the sample matrix. Expanding on this technique, Bocca et al. [132], in 2013, employed a similar acid digestion method followed by LC–MS for the measurement of trace metals in face powders. The acid nitration method effectively decomposes both organic and inorganic components in cosmetics, disrupting the complex matrix and insoluble inorganic constituents, thereby facilitating the detection of metal elements and other targeted analytes.\n\nLiquid-phase microextraction (LPME) is a sample preparation technique used to isolate and concentrate analytes from liquid samples. It involves a small amount of an organic solvent, which is immiscible with the aqueous sample, to extract the analytes. In 2007, Xiao et al. [153] developed the LPME–HPLC method for the precise quantification of trace levels of estratriol, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, and estriol in toners. This methodology involved the optimization of various experimental conditions, including the selection and volume of the acceptor phase solvent, stirring speed, and extraction duration. The analysis of these four estrogens using this method yielded recovery rates ranging from 101.2% to 114.9%. Compared with traditional pretreatment methods, this novel approach employed LPME technology, resulting in a substantial reduction in organic solvent usage and a decrease in operation time, thereby offering advantages to simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity, and environmental friendliness.\n\nMatrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) offers an efficient alternative to traditional solvent-based sample preparation by blending and grinding the sample directly with an adsorbent, making it particularly effective for solid and semi-solid matrices [17,154,155]. In 2019, Chen et al. [156] developed a protocol utilizing MSPD to detect colorants in solid cosmetics such as blush and eyeshadow. The method involved grinding the cosmetics with anhydrous sodium sulfate and sand, then transferring the mixture to an SPE column, eluting with methanol, and analyzing the eluates using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q-orbitrap HRMS). This approach successfully identified 11 prohibited colorants in cosmetics, including acid blue, acid red, acid black, acid orange, acid yellow, solvent green, solvent orange, solvent yellow, pigment red, basic violet and disperse yellow. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of combining desiccants and dispersants (anhydrous sodium sulfate and sand) in sample grinding, significantly enhancing the homogeneity of the sample and the extraction efficiency of the analytes (ranging from 64.0% to 128.4%).\n\nSimilar to MSPD, pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) [157] and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) [158] are commonly used for extracting analytes from powdered cosmetics. The use of dispersants in these methods helps prevent sample compaction and optimizes solvent consumption. This not only enhances the efficiency of the extraction process but also minimizes the environmental footprint.\n\n### 3.4. Wax-Based Cosmetics\n\nThe complex waxes in wax-based cosmetics hinder dissolution and separation, necessitating the use of potent yet toxic organic solvents like chloroform or dichloromethane and extensive pretreatment to isolate analytes [98,159].\n\nTo overcome the challenges associated with wax-based cosmetics, Wang et al. [160] introduced a method to isolate rhodamine B without using harsh solvents. Their technique utilized mechanical stirring along with sodium lauryl sulfate, an anionic surfactant, to disperse lipstick in water at 333 K (59.85 °C). The mixture was then subjected to SPE using a cotton-packed column to separate waxes, followed by fluorescence detection for quantification. This method effectively removed wax residues by reversing the flow of the mobile phase. This study adopts a straightforward approach, dissolving lipstick in a solvent through mechanical stirring at high temperatures, effectively circumventing complex sample pretreatment steps, thereby significantly enhancing the processing efficiency.\n\nAshing is a sample preparation process used in analytical chemistry to remove organic components from a sample. In this process, a sample is heated to high temperatures in the presence of air or oxygen, leading to combustion or thermal decomposition of organic substances. The result is a residue primarily composed of inorganic ash, which can then be analyzed for its elemental composition. This method is ideal for isolating heat-stable compounds in wax-based cosmetics. In 2012, Brandão et al. [161] used this technique to determine the lead content in various cosmetics, such as mascara, concealer, lipstick, and lip gloss. Their procedure involved incinerating the cosmetic samples at 600 °C, followed by digestion with nitric acid and quantification using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy for accurate lead measurements.\n\n#### Table 2.\n\nThe advantages, disadvantages, and applicable matrices of the pretreatment techniques.\n\n| Pretreatment Techniques           | Pretreatment Techniques

Conclusions\n\nThe rapid development of the cosmetics industry has not only unleashed significant market potential but also given rise to a series of challenges. The proliferation of illegal additives, regulatory delays, and the profit-driven practices of unscrupulous traders have led to the circulation of some cosmetics containing these harmful substances, posing a threat to consumer health. Despite advancements in analytical detection technologies in the food and pharmaceutical sectors, their application in cosmetics is hampered by the complexity of cosmetic formulations.\n\nIn this article, we categorize cosmetics into four main types: emulsified, liquid, powdered, and wax-based cosmetics, and provide a detailed analysis of their primary constituents, characteristics, and additive thresholds. A thorough understanding of cosmetic composition is crucial for selecting and optimizing pretreatment methods. For example, emulsified cosmetics, rich in emulsifiers and thickeners, are amenable to techniques such as UA–MSPD and dSPE. Special attention to solubility issues is necessary when employing SPE techniques. In contrast, liquid cosmetics, with their less complex matrices, are well-suited to techniques such as LLE, CPE, SPE, and SBSE. Similarly, powdered cosmetics, replete with insoluble minerals, are efficiently processed using techniques such as MSPD, PLE, and ASE, thereby avoiding the need for dissolution. Lastly, for wax-based cosmetics, alternatives to solvent use, such as mechanical stirring or ashing, are preferable for safety and toxicity concerns.\n\nFurthermore, we provide an overview of the illegal additives in cosmetics, including their types, functions, and potential presence in various cosmetic products. Mastery of this information is vital for selecting appropriate analytical detection methods. Therefore, we also introduce commonly used analytical techniques, such as UV/VIS, IR, MS, NMR, GC, HPLC, AAS, and AFS. In-depth knowledge of cosmetic constituents and illegal additives is essential for cosmetic analysis.\n\nFinally, in the third section, we comprehensively review scientific research in the field of cosmetic analysis and detection and categorize findings according to cosmetic types. This categorization aids in a clearer understanding of the objectives and focus of this review.\n\n## 5. Future Perspectives\n\nFuture research should focus on devising more appropriate and eco-friendly extraction methods that align with specific matrix compositions and advancing compact and portable extraction devices to minimize sample and solvent usage while reducing time spent. The integration of nanotechnology has offered promising materials, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) [162], molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) [163], and magnetic nano-sorbents (MNSs) [164], whose vast surface areas and selective binding can be leveraged for enhanced detection. Additionally, rapid and on-site analytical strategies, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [165] and electrochemical techniques [166], have been employed in the food and environmental sectors. The detection of illicit additives in cosmetics is analogous to compounds analysis in these areas. For instance, wastewater and liquid cosmetics, both characterized by higher fluidity, exhibit similar properties; likewise, the study of more viscous substances, like edible oils, shares methodological parallels with the analysis of emulsified cosmetic. Additionally, the analysis of solid materials, such as traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, can offer novel insights and techniques for the pretreatment of solid cosmetics. Therefore, these technologies guide the development of detection techniques for unauthorized additives in cosmetics.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge the support of the NIFDC Fund for Key Technology Research.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nConceptualization, X.-F.W. and Y.L.; writing—original draft preparation, X.-N.D.; writing—review and editing, X.-N.D., X.-F.W., Y.L., Q.L., Y.H., Y.-W.C., L.S. and H.-M.S.; funding acquisition, X.-F.W.

            "spanned_content": "<ReformattedArticle>\n    <Name>Decoding Cosmetic Complexities: A Comprehensive Guide to Matrix Composition and Pretreatment Technology</Name>\n    <AdditionalInformation>\n        <Abstract>\n            Despite advancements in analytical technologies, the complex nature of cosmetic matrices, coupled with the presence of diverse and trace unauthorized additives, hinders the application of these technologies in cosmetics analysis. This not only impedes effective regulation of cosmetics but also leads to the continual infiltration of illegal products into the market, posing serious health risks to consumers. The establishment of cosmetic regulations is often based on extensive scientific experiments, resulting in a certain degree of latency. Therefore, timely advancement in laboratory research is crucial to ensure the timely update and adaptability of regulations. A comprehensive understanding of the composition of cosmetic matrices and their pretreatment technologies is vital for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of cosmetic detection. Drawing upon the China National Medical Products Administration’s 2021 Cosmetic Classification Rules and Classification Catalogue, we streamline the wide array of cosmetics into four principal categories based on the following compositions: emulsified, liquid, powdered, and wax-based cosmetics. In this review, the characteristics, compositional elements, and physicochemical properties inherent to each category, as well as an extensive overview of the evolution of pretreatment methods for different categories, will be explored. Our objective is to provide a clear and comprehensive guide, equipping researchers with profound insights into the core compositions and pretreatment methods of cosmetics, which will in turn advance cosmetic analysis and improve detection and regulatory approaches in the industry.\n        </Abstract>\n        <Keywords>cosmetics, personal care products, compositions, pretreatment, detection, regulation</Keywords>\n    </AdditionalInformation>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>1. Introduction</Title>\n        With the development of the economy and people’s pursuit of beauty, the cosmetics industry has experienced significant growth. Despite stringent regulations, such as China’s Cosmetic Safety Technical Specifications and the European Union’s Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009, which prohibit hazardous ingredients—including lead, mercury, arsenic, antibiotics, hormones, and carcinogens—illicit products continue to infiltrate the market, posing potential dermatological risks and severe health hazards to consumers. According to the China National Medical Products Administration, 601 batches of non-compliant cosmetics were detected in 2023, 79 of which contained unauthorized ingredients. These products with illegal additives span various categories, including acne treatment cosmetics that were found with hormones like dexamethasone and clobetasol propionate and antibacterial drugs, such as clindamycin, lincomycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole. Similarly, hair care products contained preservatives like methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone, along with hair dye agents such as p-aminophenol and 2-chloro-phenylenediamine sulfate. Furthermore, face masks have been found to include hormones like desonide and flumethasone and nail polishes were found with prohibited solvents such as dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. In addition, skin lightening products have been found to contain hormone-like clobetasol propionate, and shampoos have been found to include the preservative triclosan. Even baby creams have been found to contain the illegal antifungal agent terbinafine. These illegal additives, while cost-effectively enhancing product claims, pose significant health and environmental risks.\n        \n        The reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted. Primarily, commercial interests undeniably motivate manufacturers. Additionally, the intrinsic complexity of cosmetics poses significant challenges to detection, allowing dishonest merchants to exploit vulnerabilities. Cosmetic matrices, comprising a complex blend of preservatives, emulsifiers, and thickeners, necessitate effective pretreatment before analytical detection, especially given the diverse and minute quantities of illicit additives. Although the selection of pretreatment techniques is not strictly constrained by the type of sample matrix, each matrix type has its most suitable pretreatment method. Consequently, an insufficient understanding of the compositions and properties of the matrices may lead to inappropriate pretreatment and inadequate enrichment of illegal additives. For instance, solid-phase extraction (SPE) has been employed in the pretreatment of various cosmetic products. However, SPE was initially developed as a complement or replacement for liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), making it more suited for the analysis of liquid cosmetics. In the case of non-liquid cosmetics, it is imperative to consider the specific matrix composition of the sample and incorporate additional processing steps by which to circumvent issues such as column clogging, extended processing times, excessive solvent use, and low recovery rates. Similarly, the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) method involves mixing the sample with dispersing and solid-phase extraction agents, followed by physical grinding to ensure thorough contact between the analytes and the solid-phase extractor. This method is primarily applicable to solid and semi-solid samples, rather than liquid cosmetics. Inappropriate selection of pretreatment methods can lead to reduced recovery rates, potentially resulting in illegal additives being omitted during detection and regulatory evasion. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the composition and characteristics of different cosmetic matrices is crucial when selecting appropriate pretreatment techniques and achieving effective regulation.\n        \n        The current literature summarizes cosmetic pretreatment methods based primarily on the type of extraction method, meticulously detailing the evolution and optimization of various treatment techniques. However, these articles often overlook a significant issue: the considerable differences in the matrix components of different cosmetic formulations, which hinders researchers from effectively selecting suitable pretreatment methods without a thorough understanding of the composition and properties of the cosmetic matrix. A rigorous scientific approach in this field should focus on the compatibility of both extraction methods and cosmetic ingredients. However, the multifaceted nature of cosmetics analysis, encompassing cosmetic science, pharmaceutical chemistry, and analytical chemistry, presents technical and informational gaps as hurdles, leading to a lack of comprehensive literature reviews that address matrix compositions and pretreatment techniques tailored to each cosmetic category. The Cosmetic Classification Rules and Classification Catalogue, introduced by the National Medical Products Administration of China in 2021 categorizes cosmetics into 12 types based on the following formulations: creams, liquids, gels, powders, solids, muds, waxes, sprays, aerosols, substrate-based cosmetics, freeze-dried cosmetics, and others. Our review condenses these into four primary categories based on composition and examines their matrix ingredients, key compounds, and physicochemical characteristics. We also summarize the advances in pretreatment methods for different categories that have been developed since 2005. The objective is to provide researchers with a detailed understanding of the various cosmetic matrices and aid in the refinement of pretreatment research. Such advancement is essential for enhancing the detection and monitoring of illegal additives, reinforcing the security of cosmetic products.\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>2. Compositions and Representative Compounds of Cosmetics</Title>\n        In the latest “classification rules”, many cosmetic forms share similar ingredients. Sprays and aerosols, for instance, are distinguished mainly by the presence of propellants, yet their base formulations are akin to liquid cosmetics. Creams and gels characteristically contain significant quantities of humectants and thickeners, while powders, solids, and freeze-dried cosmetics predominantly feature powdery solids. Considering that cosmetics with similar ingredients can use comparable pretreatment processes, this review proposes a categorization that simplifies 12 dosage forms into the following four primary categories: emulsified, liquid, powdered, and wax-based cosmetics. This reclassification facilitates a clearer comprehension of the commonalities and distinctions within cosmetic matrices, thus fostering the innovation of targeted and efficient pretreatment techniques in cosmetic science.\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.1. Common Ingredients in Cosmetic Formulations</Title>\n            Despite the marked variations in the matrices of diverse cosmetics, the universal application of preservatives, antioxidants, pH adjusters, chelators, and fragrances pervades various cosmetic categories.\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.1.1. Preservatives</Title>\n                Pursuant to European Regulation 1223/2009, a preservative is defined as “any substance aimed at inhibiting the proliferation of microorganisms in cosmetics”, thus extending the product’s shelf life. Common preservatives include parabens, isothiazolinones, formaldehyde releasers, ether alcohols, and organic acids alongside their salts. Parabens, such as methyl-, propyl-, and butylparaben, are cost-effective and widely used for their antifungal and antibacterial properties, especially in rinse-off products. Isothiazolinones, like methylisothiazolinone, offer broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and remain effective across diverse pH levels. Formaldehyde releasers, including imidazolidinyl urea and dimethyloldimethyl hydantoin (DMDMH), ensure low levels of free formaldehyde, providing microbial protection. Ether alcohols, such as chlorphenesin, 2-phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, pentanediol, hexanediol, and octanediol, recognized as gentler preservative alternatives, also offer broad-spectrum antibacterial benefits. Organic acids and their salts, containing levulinic acid, anisic acid, sorbic acid/potassium sorbate, and benzoic acid/sodium benzoate, although less effective against bacteria, inhibit fungi and are often used in combination with other substances like hydantoin for enhanced preservation.\n                \n                Key preservatives utilized in cosmetic formulations.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.1.2. Antioxidants</Title>\n                The complexity of cosmetic formulations, with their oxidization-prone components, such as lipids, requires an antioxidant system for quality preservation and product stability. Antioxidants are broadly categorized into synthetic and natural types. Synthetic antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), tertiary-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), and propyl gallate, are engineered in the laboratory to effectively inhibit oxidative damage from light, heat, or metals. In contrast, natural antioxidants—sourced mainly from plants, fruits, or other biological origins—include vitamin E, vitamin C, superoxide dismutase (SOD), coenzyme Q10, and other compounds, such as curcumin, astaxanthin, resveratrol, glutathione, rosemary extracts, and various flavonoids.\n                \n                Principal antioxidants in cosmetic formulations.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.1.3. pH Adjusters</Title>\n                Most cosmetic products have a pH range between 4.0 and 8.5. The distinct acid–base properties of certain ingredients necessitate the use of pH adjusters to maintain the pH within this desired range. Common pH adjusters include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), triethanolamine, citric acid, sodium citrate, succinic acid, disodium succinate, and potassium phosphates. Certain components, such as the high-molecular-weight thickener carbopol, require specific pH conditions to function optimally. In this case, an alkaline pH adjuster is needed for effective thickening. With advances in material technology, there is now a diverse selection of over a hundred thickening agents available. pH adjusters are thus essential for the stability, safety, and performance of cosmetic products.\n                \n                Predominant pH adjusters, chelators, and fragrances in cosmetic matrices.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.1.4. Chelators</Title>\n                Chelators are crucial in cosmetics for binding metal ions, preventing deleterious interactions with other ingredients, and enhancing product stability and longevity. Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a common chelator that not only effectively immobilizes various metal ions but also exhibits a synergistic interplay with preservatives and antioxidants. Although allergic responses are undocumented, disodium EDTA may facilitate skin penetration because of its low molecular weight, which could disrupt the metal ion balance in the body and cause irritation or other negative effects. Other notable chelators include citric acid and phosphoric acid.\n                \n                Chelators possess chemical structures capable of forming multiple coordination bonds with metal ions. For example, disodium EDTA, with its four carboxyl and two amino groups, establishes six-point coordination, forming stable cyclic structures with metal ions. Similarly, citric acid forms multipoint coordination via its three carboxyl and one hydroxyl groups. These functional groups significantly contribute to their water solubility.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.1.5. Fragrances</Title>\n                Cosmetic matrices incorporate fragrances to impart a desirable scent. These fragrances are broadly classified into natural and synthetic categories. Natural fragrances, sourced from botanical and zoological materials, such as petals, leaves, roots, fruits, resins, and animal-derived essences, endow products with authentic scents. In contrast, synthetic fragrances, engineered in laboratories, have complex compositions formed by combining various chemical structures. The Catalogue of Cosmetic Ingredients in Use (2021 Edition) lists only four substances explicitly as fragrances: flavor, aroma, parfum, and fragrance. It also lists compounds, including linalool, vanillin, cinnamaldehyde, and eugenol, that can be used as fragrances.\n                \n                Cosmetic products encompass not only common ingredients, such as preservatives, antioxidants, pH adjusters, chelators, and fragrances, but also specific ingredients that impart distinctive properties and effects to each product. In pretreatment research, it is imperative to consider these ingredients to ensure the precision and efficiency of the research process. This review proceeds to delineate four cosmetic formulation categories, detailing their respective compositional nuances.\n            </Subsection>\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.2. Emulsified Cosmetics</Title>\n            Emulsified cosmetic categories—encompassing creams, gels, and muds—are the primary vehicles for various skincare formulations such as face creams, facial cleansers, and aloe vera gels. These matrices are intricate, consisting of oils, aqueous phases, emulsifiers, humectants, and thickeners, in addition to their common ingredients. The synergistic interplay of these ingredients determines the specific properties and performance efficacy of emulsified cosmetics.\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.2.1. Oils</Title>\n                Oil-based ingredients confer softness, lubricity, and spreadability to emulsified cosmetics, primarily consisting of plant oils such as shea, olive, and grape seed oil; animal fats such as lanolin and beeswax; mineral fats such as petrolatum; synthetic fats, including isopropyl palmitate and caprylic/capric triglyceride; silicones, notably, polydimethylsiloxane; and fatty alcohols such as lecithin, squalane, and cetylicalcohol.\n                \n                Key oil-based constituents in cosmetic formulations.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.2.2. Aqueous Phases</Title>\n                Deionized water is the most common aqueous phase in cosmetics, primarily dissolving water-soluble preservatives, antioxidants, and active agents such as botanical extracts, fermentation broths, and enzymatic formulations. The International Cosmetic Ingredient Standard Chinese Name Catalog mainly lists thermal spring water and seawater among its entries. However, niche waters, including deep sea and glacial varieties, have recently entered the market, and are desired for their rich mineral contents and potential soothing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.2.3. Emulsifiers</Title>\n                Emulsifiers are crucial for stabilizing emulsified cosmetics, with their selection depending on factors such as their oil-to-water ratios, hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) values, and critical packing parameters. Prominent emulsifiers include Tween and Span, specifically, Tween 60 for oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions and Span 60 for water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions; fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ethers; glycerides; polyglycerines; anionic types; and saccharide derivatives.\n                \n                Central emulsifying agents in cosmetic preparations.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.2.4. Humectants</Title>\n                Humectants, such as polyols like glycerin, butylene glycol, and panthenol; natural skin components, such as sodium hyaluronate, trehalose and ceramides; and amino acid derivatives, including betaine, sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid and sodium lactate, are essential for retaining moisture, preventing desiccation, and maintaining the skin’s hydration equilibrium.\n                \n                Prominent humectants and thickeners employed in cosmetic matrices.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.2.5. Thickeners</Title>\n                The texture of emulsified cosmetic formulations is largely influenced by thickeners, which are second only to solvents in terms of quantity. Thickeners are categorized by their functional groups: inorganic salts; fatty alcohols and acids; alkanolamides; ethers; esters; oxidized amines; amphoteric surfactants; anionic surfactants; cellulose derivatives; natural gums and modified gums; and inorganic polymers and their derivatives.\n                \n                Most thickeners are composed of long carbon chains, along with polar groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amide groups. These long-chain structures intertwine within solutions, increasing the solution’s resistance to flow and thereby enhancing its viscosity. Additionally, the polar groups can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, further enhancing the water’s viscosity. Thickeners can be categorized into two main types based on their solubility: water-soluble and oil-soluble. Water-soluble thickeners are primarily composed of polar groups, whereas oil-soluble thickeners contain long carbon chains. In the pretreatment research of cosmetics, the selection of an appropriate solvent depends on the specific type of thickener used.\n            </Subsection>\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.3. Liquid Cosmetics</Title>\n            In this context, liquid cosmetics refer to products without emulsifiers and exhibit significant fluidity, including liquids, sprays, aerosols, and substrate-based cosmetics, such as shampoos, perfumes, nail polishes, and facial masks. The compositions of these products are relatively uncomplicated, primarily comprising common ingredients, solvents, and humectants, as well as propellants, which are characteristic of spray products.\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.3.1. Solvents</Title>\n                Solvents are essential in the formulation of liquid cosmetics, as they dissolve active ingredients and enhance product fluidity. Commonly used solvents include water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, toluene, oils, and botanical extracts. Water is often preferred due to its low cost and high solvency. Ethanol is effective in dissolving oils, fragrances, and plant-derived ingredients and is frequently used with water to leverage its antimicrobial properties. Ethyl acetate and toluene are staples in nail polish, though concerns about toluene’s irritation potential have led to its decreased use and regulatory restrictions internationally. Oils and plant extracts are selected not only for their solvency but also for their additional benefits to the product.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.3.2. Propellants</Title>\n                Propellants are essential for the ejection of contents from aerosol containers, such as hairspray. Common propellants include propane, butane, isobutane, and environmentally friendly options such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) is severely restricted because of their ozone-depleting effects. Consequently, the choice of propellants is dictated not only by the specific needs of the product but also by stringent regional environmental regulations.\n            </Subsection>\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.4. Powdered Cosmetics</Title>\n            Powdered cosmetics encompass powders, solids, and freeze-dried cosmetics such as body powders, pressed powders, and blushes. These products are formulated with binders, slip agents, fillers, and colorants, in addition to their common ingredients, which collectively determine the texture, appearance, and performance of the cosmetic item.\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.4.1. Binders</Title>\n                In powdered cosmetics, binders are essential for combining slip agents, fillers, colorants, and other materials into a cohesive product. Natural binders, such as beeswax and keratin, not only help to hold the product together but also provide antimicrobial benefits. Oleophilic binders, such as liquid paraffin and silicone oils, are chosen for their ability to enhance the smoothness of application and to stabilize the particles. Synthetic binders, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), are favored for their strong cohesive properties and for imparting a flexible and sleek texture to the final product.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.4.2. Slip Agents</Title>\n                In powdered cosmetic formulations, slip agents, such as sorbitan esters, propylene glycol, and PEG-8, play a crucial role in improving texture and facilitating smooth application. These ingredients help to optimize powder dispersion, prevent the excessive cohesion of particles, and reduce the likelihood of caking, thereby promoting an even application and imparting a silky feel to the skin. Due to their hygroscopic properties, which allow them to attract and retain moisture, they also contribute to maintaining skin hydration.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.4.3. Fillers</Title>\n                In powdered cosmetics, fillers, such as mica, kaolin, calcium carbonate, talc, silica, pearl, and nylon, are used to modulate color intensity, increase volume, and enhance texture. These substances confer beneficial characteristics, such as sheen for visual appeal, silkiness for a smooth touch, oil absorption for longer wear, and soft-focus effects for a flattering finish. However, their chemical stability and low solubility can pose challenges during pretreatment processing, as these properties may necessitate specialized techniques for their dispersion and dissolution.\n            </Subsection>\n            \n            <Subsection>\n                <Title>2.4.4. Colorants</Title>\n                Colorants are pivotal in powdered cosmetics for providing hue and are categorized as organic or inorganic. Organic colorants encompass plant-based pigments, synthetic dyes, and lakes, which are dyes deposited onto substrates. In contrast, inorganic colorants, such as iron oxides, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and mica, are often preferred in such formulations for their stability, minimal skin irritation, and ability to provide opacity and coverage. These inorganic options are favored not only for their consistent coloration but also for their safety profile and non-irritating nature, ensuring both product efficacy and consumer comfort.\n            </Subsection>\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.5. Wax-Based Cosmetics</Title>\n            Wax-based cosmetics are products that incorporate the waxes, such as carnauba, candelilla, jojoba, bees, and Japan waxes, that are essential for enhancing stability, controlling viscosity, and ensuring a non-tacky feel. Carnauba wax is particularly prized in color cosmetics for its excellent thickening and stabilizing abilities. Candelilla wax is treasured for its natural composition, contributing to product consistency and a refined texture. Jojoba wax is recognized for its remarkable stability and resistance to oxidation, making it a versatile choice for a variety of wax-based products. Beeswax is widely used for its inherent stability and antimicrobial properties, making it a staple in color cosmetics as well as skincare preparations. The pronounced hydrophobic properties of wax signify its insolubility in water. However, wax is only soluble in certain organic solvents, such as chloroform, mineral oil, or certain alcohols. Additionally, the inherent viscosity of wax further complicates its pretreatment process.\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.6. Thresholds for Cosmetic Ingredient Additions</Title>\n            Cosmetics, as complex mixtures composed of various ingredients, benefit from an understanding of their approximate compositional ranges to optimize pretreatment and analytical conditions. For instance, in the application of preservatives, chlorphenesin is permitted at a maximum concentration of 0.3%, whereas 1,2-pentanediol can reach up to 21.29% in the highest historical usage for residency category products. Awareness of such information is crucial when identifying and mitigating potential interferences during pretreatment and analysis. We conducted a thorough inquiry into the additional ranges of each substance mentioned in the aforementioned section. Acknowledging that different countries and regulations may vary in their requirements for the same substance, our initial references were the European Union regulations (EC) No 1223/2009 and Commission Regulation (EU) 2022/2195, followed by the Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics of China (2015 Edition) and the Cosmetics Ingredients Catalog used in China (2021 edition). Additionally, we consulted data from several professional websites.\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.7. Illegal Additives in Cosmetics</Title>\n            Beyond the complexity of their matrices, cosmetics also present intricate challenges due to the illegal additives incorporated into them. In China, the “Prohibited Ingredients Catalogue for Cosmetics” and the “Prohibited Plant and Animal Materials Catalogue in Cosmetics” cumulatively prohibit the use of 1393 ingredients, while the European Union’s EC No. 1223/2009 regulation lists 1328 banned substances. However, the actual number of illicitly added ingredients far exceeds those enumerated in these directories. The reasons for this are multifaceted. Firstly, all compounds with similar functions are uniformly classified under the same category, such as “antibiotics” and “substances with androgenic effect”. Secondly, derivatives and salts of certain compounds are also grouped together, for instance, “aniline, its salts and its halogenated and sulphonated derivatives”. Lastly, these prohibitory lists are continuously updated, not only adding new banned substances but also shifting the status of certain ingredients from prohibited to restricted. These factors collectively amplify the complexity and challenges in the regulation of cosmetics.\n            \n            The utilization of illegal additives in cosmetics is driven by a myriad of complex factors. Initially, some manufacturers might opt for prohibited, lower-cost chemical substances as substitutes for expensive, yet safe, ingredients. For instance, illegal additives N-(5-Chlorobenzoxazol-2-yl)acetamide and alkyne alcohols are inexpensive and have antimicrobial and antiseptic effects. Additionally, substances like benzidine, antimony, arsenic, and xylidines, despite their pigmentary properties and lower costs, are employed as alternative pigments. Furthermore, certain illegal additives are incorporated into cosmetics to augment product efficacy. Medications originally intended for anxiety and insomnia treatment, such as carbromal, isocarboxazid, benzazepines, and bromisoval, might be illicitly added to products like frankincense, essential oils, and skincare items for their sedative effects. Hypoglycemic drugs like tolbutamide, carbutamide, and sulfonylurea derivatives, due to their ability to reduce sugar absorption and consequently aid in weight loss, are sometimes used in slimming cosmetics. Spironolactone, an anti-androgen medication, can decrease sebum production, aiding in acne control. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as antibiotics, aminocaproic acid, cinchophen, epinephrine, and mofebutazone, can alleviate skin inflammation and swelling. Trichloroacetic acid, used for exfoliating old skin layers and mitigating hyperpigmentation, is commonly found in acne and skin whitening products. While these drugs possess specific therapeutic effects, their use should be strictly regulated in medical contexts and never added to cosmetics without authorization. Nonetheless, some unscrupulous businesses might incorporate these substances into their products to enhance effectiveness, reduce costs, and increase profit margins. Lastly, the presence of certain illegal additives might result from technical flaws in the production process rather than intentional inclusion. For example, heavy metal contaminants, like lead, mercury, cadmium, and residual solvents, such as anthracene oil and benzene. Although unintentional, these instances pose potential health risks to consumers and thus necessitate stringent regulation.\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>2.8. Analytical Technologies in Cosmetics</Title>\n            The diversity of illegal additives determines the crucial role of selecting appropriate analytical technologies. Ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy (UV/VIS) primarily operates on the principle of substance absorption of ultraviolet or visible light, utilizing absorption spectra for the analysis of compounds. It is particularly applicable to organic compounds capable of absorbing UV or visible light, such as dyes and sunscreens in cosmetics. Infrared spectroscopy (IR), conversely, is based on the principle of the molecular absorption of specific frequencies of infrared light, causing changes in vibrational energy levels. This method is suitable for both organic and inorganic compounds containing chemical bonds, frequently used in the analysis of lipids, fragrances, and moisturizers in cosmetics. Mass spectrometry (MS) identifies molecular mass and composition by measuring the trajectory of molecules in electric or magnetic fields, applicable to nearly all compounds and particularly suited for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of complex cosmetic components. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) leverages the absorption and emission of radio waves by atomic nuclei in an external magnetic field, applicable to organic compounds containing active nuclei (such as 1H, 13C), and is instrumental in analyzing the structure of complex organic compounds in cosmetics. Gas chromatography (GC) employs gas as the mobile phase and separates components through a stationary phase in a chromatography column, ideal for volatile and thermally stable organic compounds like fragrances and solvents in cosmetics. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) uses a liquid as the mobile phase under high pressure to separate components, is extensively applicable to various organic compounds, including high molecular weight and non-volatile substances, and is used for detecting and analyzing moisturizers, preservatives, vitamins, and other components in cosmetics. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is based on the absorption of specific wavelengths of light by atomic vapor and is used for the analysis of metal elements and some metal compounds, such as heavy metal impurities (like lead or mercury) in cosmetics. Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS) relies on the fluorescence generated by atoms transitioning between ground and excited states, is primarily used for trace element analysis (such as mercury, arsenic or selenium) and is applicable to the detection of trace harmful elements in cosmetics.\n            \n            These techniques play a vital role in the analysis of cosmetics, ensuring product quality and safety, and aiding in the development of new products. Given the considerable variation in components across different types of cosmetics, selecting appropriate analytical techniques is crucial for the accurate identification and quantification of these components.\n        </Subsection>\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>3. Advances in Cosmetic Pretreatment Techniques</Title>\n        The diversity of cosmetic matrices requires appropriate pretreatment methods. For emulsified cosmetics rich in emulsifiers and thickeners, techniques such as field-assisted extraction, which utilizes oscillation or microwave-assisted heating, and supercritical fluid extraction, often with CO2, are preferred. Conversely, liquid cosmetics with simpler matrices benefit from phase separation techniques such as liquid–liquid extraction. Aqueous extraction is ideal for products rich in polar compounds, while headspace analysis is best suited for isolating volatile constituents. This review delineates the evolution of pretreatment strategies for diverse cosmetic categories since 2005. The advantages, disadvantages, and applicable matrices of the pretreatment techniques discussed in this article are briefly summarized in a table.\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>3.1. Emulsified Cosmetics</Title>\n            Emulsified cosmetics, with their intricate matrices of thickeners and emulsifiers, often present challenges in traditional solvent dissolution, resulting in suboptimal analyte recovery. In 2012, Zhong et al. addressed this by employing ultrasound-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersive liquid extraction (UA–MSPD), which utilizes anhydrous sodium sulfite to disperse hair dyes, facilitating the extraction of analytes into an acidic medium. Concurrently, oil-based substances and thickeners are solubilized in n-hexane, with adsorbents capturing interfering compounds. This study innovatively employs dispersants to effectively disperse viscous hair dyes, thereby significantly simplifying the operational process. The method requires only 9 min to complete the entire procedure and demonstrates a high recovery rate, ranging from 85.7% to 107%.\n            \n            Solid-phase extraction (SPE), a traditional preparation technique, faces limitations when applied to emulsified cosmetics due to mass transfer resistance, which can lead to longer elution times and higher solvent consumption. In 2014, Zhan et al. introduced an improved approach known as dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE). This method is initiated by suspending the cosmetic in acetonitrile. Subsequently, C18 silica is added as an adsorbent, and MgSO4 is employed to facilitate the dispersion of the matrix, followed by vigorous shaking and cotton filtration. The use of dispersants in conjunction with cotton filtration effectively eliminates interference from complex sample matrices in analytical results, streamlining the extraction process. This approach demonstrates excellent linearity for concentrations of up to 480 g/kg, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.982 to 0.999.\n            \n            Bimatoprost and latanoprost, as first-line pharmacological agents for glaucoma treatment, have been determined to induce hypertrichosis as a side effect. Unscrupulous cosmetic manufacturers exploit this adverse effect by incorporating these drugs into eyelash growth serums. Prolonged exposure to cosmetics containing prostaglandin drugs can potentially lead to local skin or ocular discomfort, allergic reactions, and even impact cardiovascular health. Compared with traditional extraction methods, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) demonstrates superior efficiency, gentleness, and environmental friendliness. It effectively extracts active ingredients from complex matrices while preserving the stability of thermosensitive substances. In 2023, Yong et al. applied UAE technology to process commercially available eyelash serums, followed by separation and purification using silica gel columns. Employing the Cosmetic Risk Substance Screening Platform, they detected suspicious components in two different fractions. These components were further purified using high-performance liquid chromatography and identified as bimatoprost and latanoprost through high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This extraction method exhibited an excellent linear range from 0.25–50 ng/mL, with notably low detection and quantitation limits.\n            \n            Fullerene, a nanomaterial composed of carbon atoms, is utilized in the cosmetics industry due to its exceptional antioxidative properties. However, given its status as an emerging nanomaterial, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of its potential impacts and safety. Liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), a common separation technique, often struggles with emulsified cosmetics due to stable emulsions formed by emulsifiers and surfactants, which resist phase separation. In 2006, Xia et al. improved this method by incorporating acetic acid, which effectively dissolves these challenging components, thereby enhancing the recovery of fullerenes from facial creams and serums. This modified approach successfully overcomes the emulsification challenges that typically impede traditional liquid–liquid extraction methods.\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>3.2. Liquid Cosmetics</Title>\n            Liquid cosmetics, with their relatively simple matrix, are well-suited to a variety of extraction techniques, thanks to the minimal risk of emulsification and column clogging. Applicable techniques include LLE, cloud point extraction (CPE), SPE, and stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE).\n            \n            Liquid–liquid extraction is a favored method in analytical chemistry for its efficiency and simplicity. Certain water-compatible organic solvents can separate into two distinct phases in the presence of inorganic salts. Cai et al. efficiently isolated phthalates from cosmetic waters and perfumes using this method, which is notably straightforward, achieves rapid partition equilibrium, and integrates seamlessly with HPLC analysis. CPE, another efficient technique, employs surfactant micellization for phase separation. In 2011, Soruraddin et al. utilized this method in treating shampoo with sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, subsequently warming it to 40 °C and adding 0.5% phenol to induce micelle formation, enabling the spectrophotometric determination of trace selenium (IV) within the micellar phase of Triton X-100. This study employs an economical and environmentally friendly approach, utilizing temperature elevation to the cloud point to form micelles, thereby achieving biphasic separation. This method is straightforward in operation, with a recovery rate ranging from 98% to 102%. Additionally, co-precipitation-assisted cloud point extraction enhances this technique by using co-precipitants for better analyte extraction. In 2013, Xiao et al. combined aluminum hydroxide co-precipitation with sodium dodecyl sulfate-mediated cloud point extraction to effectively isolate and extract five estrogens from toners. Similar to CPE, this study enhances the enrichment and separation of target analytes during cloud point extraction by incorporating coprecipitants to form precipitates with the analytes. Applied to the extraction of estrogens in cosmetics, this method achieves a recovery rate ranging from 77.3% to 104.1%.\n            \n            SPE is extensively utilized in food safety, pharmaceutical analysis, and biomedicine, using common adsorbents like diatomaceous earth, alumina, silica, and C18 and C8 silicas. Recently, innovative adsorbents have been developed, such as nitrated garlic skin, corn fibers, molecularly imprinted polymers, artificial antibodies, and magnetic SPE. In 2020, Zhao et al. developed a technique for detecting four steroids in shampoo, employing a deep-eutectic-solvent-based magnetic colloidal gel (DES–MCG) in magnetic SPE. They synthesized a DES–MCG adsorbent using a choline chloride–urea deep eutectic solvent with magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MMWCNTs). This novel adsorbent was used to extract analytes from concentrated shampoos, achieving recoveries ranging from 80.1% to 118.8%. This method integrates deep eutectic solvents with MMWCNTs, not only optimizing the sample processing procedure but also enhancing the recovery rate. Moreover, it exhibits superior environmental friendliness, aligning with the requirements of green analytical chemistry.\n            \n            Parabens, common preservatives in cosmetics, are limited by the EU to a maximum concentration of 0.8% (w/w) in products. Traditional SPE suffers from low selectivity, often resulting in the co-extraction of various matrix components, adversely affecting the quantitative analysis of analytes. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) are synthetic materials capable of selectively interacting with specific chemical functional groups. Utilizing MIPs that selectively bind parabens enhances the selectivity of SPE. In 2018, Vicario et al. synthesized MIPs using propylparaben as a template. They employed MIP-based solid-phase extraction (MISPE) for pretreatment of commercially available baby wipes, followed by analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method, demonstrating an over 86.15% recovery rate, showed greater selectivity, stability, and improved retention capabilities compared to traditional SPE methods.\n            \n            Acrylamide, a compound capable of forming covalent bonds with macromolecules such as proteins and DNA, is known to induce mutations and has potential carcinogenic effects. The presence of amino acids and sugars in cosmetic ingredients can lead to the formation of acrylamide during processing. Consequently, monitoring and controlling the content of acrylamide in cosmetics is of paramount importance. In 2023, Schettino et al. utilized vortex-assisted reverse-phase dispersive liquid phase microextraction (LPME), employing water as the extraction solvent, to successfully extract and pre-concentrate acrylamide from liquid hand soaps and makeup removers. Subsequent analysis of the extracted acrylamide was conducted using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). This method, upon validation, demonstrated excellent analytical performance, including linearity, detection and quantification limits, with a recovery rate of 88–108%. Efficient, simple, and rapid, this method precisely quantifies trace levels of acrylamide, providing a robust tool for assessing the safety of cosmetics.\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>3.3. Powdered Cosmetics</Title>\n            Powdered cosmetics, rich in minerals that are largely insoluble in conventional solvents, present challenges in pretreatment. In 2010, Cha et al. tackled this by using a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids for mineral decomposition via microwave digestion, which enabled the quantitative analysis of six metals—iron, copper, zinc, lead, nickel, and cadmium—in various cosmetic products using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Microwave digestion involves heating a sample with a strong acid inside a closed vessel using microwave radiation. This process significantly speeds up the digestion process, allowing for the efficient breakdown of the sample matrix. Expanding on this technique, Bocca et al. employed a similar acid digestion method followed by LC–MS for the measurement of trace metals in face powders. The acid nitration method effectively decomposes both organic and inorganic components in cosmetics, disrupting the complex matrix and insoluble inorganic constituents, thereby facilitating the detection of metal elements and other targeted analytes.\n            \n            Liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) is a sample preparation technique used to isolate and concentrate analytes from liquid samples. It involves a small amount of an organic solvent, which is immiscible with the aqueous sample, to extract the analytes. In 2007, Xiao et al. developed the LPME–HPLC method for the precise quantification of trace levels of estratriol, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, and estriol in toners. This methodology involved the optimization of various experimental conditions, including the selection and volume of the acceptor phase solvent, stirring speed, and extraction duration. The analysis of these four estrogens using this method yielded recovery rates ranging from 101.2% to 114.9%. Compared with traditional pretreatment methods, this novel approach employed LPME technology, resulting in a substantial reduction in organic solvent usage and a decrease in operation time, thereby offering advantages to simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity, and environmental friendliness.\n            \n            Matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) offers an efficient alternative to traditional solvent-based sample preparation by blending and grinding the sample directly with an adsorbent, making it particularly effective for solid and semi-solid matrices. In 2019, Chen et al. developed a protocol utilizing MSPD to detect colorants in solid cosmetics such as blush and eyeshadow. The method involved grinding the cosmetics with anhydrous sodium sulfate and sand, then transferring the mixture to an SPE column, eluting with methanol, and analyzing the eluates using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q-orbitrap HRMS). This approach successfully identified 11 prohibited colorants in cosmetics, including acid blue, acid red, acid black, acid orange, acid yellow, solvent green, solvent orange, solvent yellow, pigment red, basic violet and disperse yellow. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of combining desiccants and dispersants in sample grinding, significantly enhancing the homogeneity of the sample and the extraction efficiency of the analytes.\n            \n            Similar to MSPD, pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) are commonly used for extracting analytes from powdered cosmetics. The use of dispersants in these methods helps prevent sample compaction and optimizes solvent consumption. This not only enhances the efficiency of the extraction process but also minimizes the environmental footprint.\n        </Subsection>\n        \n        <Subsection>\n            <Title>3.4. Wax-Based Cosmetics</Title>\n            The complex waxes in wax-based cosmetics hinder dissolution and separation, necessitating the use of potent yet toxic organic solvents like chloroform or dichloromethane and extensive pretreatment to isolate analytes.\n            \n            To overcome the challenges associated with wax-based cosmetics, Wang et al. introduced a method to isolate rhodamine B without using harsh solvents. Their technique utilized mechanical stirring along with sodium lauryl sulfate, an anionic surfactant, to disperse lipstick in water at 333 K. The mixture was then subjected to SPE using a cotton-packed column to separate waxes, followed by fluorescence detection for quantification. This method effectively removed wax residues by reversing the flow of the mobile phase. This study adopts a straightforward approach, dissolving lipstick in a solvent through mechanical stirring at high temperatures, effectively circumventing complex sample pretreatment steps, thereby significantly enhancing the processing efficiency.\n            \n            Ashing is a sample preparation process used in analytical chemistry to remove organic components from a sample. In this process, a sample is heated to high temperatures in the presence of air or oxygen, leading to combustion or thermal decomposition of organic substances. The result is a residue primarily composed of inorganic ash, which can then be analyzed for its elemental composition. This method is ideal for isolating heat-stable compounds in wax-based cosmetics. In 2012, Brandão et al. used this technique to determine the lead content in various cosmetics, such as mascara, concealer, lipstick, and lip gloss. Their procedure involved incinerating the cosmetic samples at 600 °C, followed by digestion with nitric acid and quantification using flame atomic absorption spectroscopy for accurate lead measurements.\n        </Subsection>\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>4. Conclusions</Title>\n        The rapid development of the cosmetics industry has not only unleashed significant market potential but also given rise to a series of challenges. The proliferation of illegal additives, regulatory delays, and the profit-driven practices of unscrupulous traders have led to the circulation of some cosmetics containing these harmful substances, posing a threat to consumer health. Despite advancements in analytical detection technologies in the food and pharmaceutical sectors, their application in cosmetics is hampered by the complexity of cosmetic formulations.\n        \n        In this article, we categorize cosmetics into four main types: emulsified, liquid, powdered, and wax-based cosmetics, and provide a detailed analysis of their primary constituents, characteristics, and additive thresholds. A thorough understanding of cosmetic composition is crucial for selecting and optimizing pretreatment methods. For example, emulsified cosmetics, rich in emulsifiers and thickeners, are amenable to techniques such as UA–MSPD and dSPE. Special attention to solubility issues is necessary when employing SPE techniques. In contrast, liquid cosmetics, with their less complex matrices, are well-suited to techniques such as LLE, CPE, SPE, and SBSE. Similarly, powdered cosmetics, replete with insoluble minerals, are efficiently processed using techniques such as MSPD, PLE, and ASE, thereby avoiding the need for dissolution. Lastly, for wax-based cosmetics, alternatives to solvent use, such as mechanical stirring or ashing, are preferable for safety and toxicity concerns.\n        \n        Furthermore, we provide an overview of the illegal additives in cosmetics, including their types, functions, and potential presence in various cosmetic products. Mastery of this information is vital for selecting appropriate analytical detection methods. Therefore, we also introduce commonly used analytical techniques, such as UV/VIS, IR, MS, NMR, GC, HPLC, AAS, and AFS. In-depth knowledge of cosmetic constituents and illegal additives is essential for cosmetic analysis.\n        \n        Finally, in the third section, we comprehensively review scientific research in the field of cosmetic analysis and detection and categorize findings according to cosmetic types. This categorization aids in a clearer understanding of the objectives and focus of this review.\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>5. Future Perspectives</Title>\n        Future research should focus on devising more appropriate and eco-friendly extraction methods that align with specific matrix compositions and advancing compact and portable extraction devices to minimize sample and solvent usage while reducing time spent. The integration of nanotechnology has offered promising materials, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), and magnetic nano-sorbents (MNSs), whose vast surface areas and selective binding can be leveraged for enhanced detection. Additionally, rapid and on-site analytical strategies, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and electrochemical techniques, have been employed in the food and environmental sectors. The detection of illicit additives in cosmetics is analogous to compounds analysis in these areas. For instance, wastewater and liquid cosmetics, both characterized by higher fluidity, exhibit similar properties; likewise, the study of more viscous substances, like edible oils, shares methodological parallels with the analysis of emulsified cosmetic. Additionally, the analysis of solid materials, such as traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, can offer novel insights and techniques for the pretreatment of solid cosmetics. Therefore, these technologies guide the development of detection techniques for unauthorized additives in cosmetics.\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>Acknowledgments</Title>\n        The authors acknowledge the support of the NIFDC Fund for Key Technology Research.\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>Author Contributions</Title>\n        Conceptualization, X.-F.W. and Y.L.; writing—original draft preparation, X.-N.D.; writing—review and editing, X.-N.D., X.-F.W., Y.L., Q.L., Y.H., Y.-W.C., L.S. and H.-M.S.; funding acquisition, X.-F.W.

Be the first to review this title.\n\n## What's the Story?\n\nLi-Mei (Yu-Wei Shao) is a successful news anchor who becomes suspicious of her father's (Tien-Chu Lee) new girlfriend (Lin Mei-hsiu), who might just be a mysterious serial killer. She joins forces with a prosecutor (Rhyian Vaughan) to unmask her before it's too late, becoming entangled in a dangerous game where appearances are always deceiving.\n\n## Is It Any Good?\n\nThis Taiwanese drama is worth a look. In just under two hours, director Hsin Yin Sung packs social commentary on misogyny, serial killer genre thrills, and dark comedy into a wickedly delightful package that shimmers like the most enticing soap opera. Everything in Lost in Perfection is played for an extra dramatic effect, and surprisingly it never veers into camp territory. Even the strangest characters are modulated to seem like humans and never caricatures.\n\nBased on a real-life case, the film makes for great food for thought, while never failing to entertain.

It stars George Clooney as financial television host Lee Gates and Julia Roberts as his producer Patty Fenn, as they are put in an extreme situation when an irate investor takes them and their crew as hostage. The cast also features Jack O'Connell, Dominic West, Caitríona Balfe, and Giancarlo Esposito.\n\nMoney Monster had its world premiere at the 69th Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States the next day by Sony Pictures Releasing. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing over $93 million against a budget of $27.4 million.\n\n## Plot\n\nFlamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, Money Monster. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but Camby unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nMidway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.\n\nWith the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it.\n\nLee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong.\n\nOnce Camby arrives, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to Johannesburg, South Africa. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper misses a shot at Lee, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where, according to Diane, Camby is headed. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, simply clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers.\n\nCamby had bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. Had his plan succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when mine work resumed and the owner's stock owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company.\n\nDespite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then Kyle, much to Lee's dismay, gets fatally shot by the police.

Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but Camby unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland. Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives. With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it. Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong. Once Camby arrives, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to Johannesburg, South Africa. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper misses a shot at Lee, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where, according to Diane, Camby is headed. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, simply clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers. Camby had bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. Had his plan succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when mine work resumed and the owner's stock owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company. Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then Kyle, much to Lee's dismay, gets fatally shot by the police. Lee punches Camby, as his greed and corruption cost Kyle his life. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be placed under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Lee and Patty reconcile, wondering how they follow their last broadcast.\",\n            \"Cast\": [\n                \"George Clooney as Lee Gates\",\n                \"Julia Roberts as Patty Fenn\",\n                \"Jack O'Connell as Kyle Budwell\",\n                \"Dominic West as Walt Camby\",\n                \"Caitriona Balfe as Diane Lester\",\n                \"Giancarlo Esposito as Captain Marcus Powell\",\n                \"Christopher Denham as Ron Sprecher\",\n                \"Lenny Venito as Lenny, The Cameraman\",\n                \"Chris Bauer as Lieutenant Nelson\",\n                \"Dennis Boutsikaris as Avery, Goodloe CFO\",\n                \"Emily Meade as Molly\",\n                \"Condola Rashād as Bree, The Assistant\",\n                \"Aaron Yoo as Won Joon\",\n                \"Makhaola Ndebele as Moshe Mambo\",\n                \"Olivia Luccardi as Arlene\",\n                \"Anthony DeSando as Officer Benson\",\n                \"John Ventimiglia as A Team Leader\",\n                \"Grant Rosenmeyer as Dave\",\n                \"Greta Lee as Amy\",\n                \"Laura Meakin as Wall Street Woman\",\n                \"Cenk Uygur as Himself\"\n            ],\n            \"Production\": {\n                \"Development\": \"The project Money Monster was first announced by Deadline on February 7, 2012, when Daniel Dubiecki launched his own film production company, The Allegiance Theater.

                    "Plot": "Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, Money Monster. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but Camby unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland. Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives. With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it. Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong. Once Camby arrives, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to Johannesburg, South Africa. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper misses a shot at Lee, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where, according to Diane, Camby is headed. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, simply clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers. Camby had bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. Had his plan succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when mine work resumed and the owner's stock owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company. Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then Kyle, much to Lee's dismay, gets fatally shot by the police. Lee punches Camby, as his greed and corruption cost Kyle his life. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be placed under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Lee and Patty reconcile, wondering how they follow their last broadcast.",

It went on to gross $14.8 million in its opening weekend, beating expectations and finishing 3rd at the box office behind Captain America: Civil War and The Jungle Book. It fell 53% to $7 million in its second weekend, finishing 6th.",
                        "CriticalResponse": "On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site's critics consensus reads: 'Money Monster's strong cast and solidly written story ride a timely wave of socioeconomic anger that's powerful enough to overcome an occasionally muddled approach to its worthy themes.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating 'mixed or average reviews'. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of 'B+' on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 81% overall positive score, with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it. Clooney's performance was praised by critics. A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that the 'quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points.' Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com, in a mixed review, praised Clooney's 'enormous charisma', but criticized the film for not 'being quite as thrilling or thought-provoking as [its] premise sounds.' Chris Hewitt of Empire however gave a more positive review. Several reviewers praised the atmosphere of suspense. Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the film, particularly Foster's directing and her ability to 'keep things moving'. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that Foster 'keeps the action vigorous and the suspense high', but said that the film was 'swallowed up by the very hectoring and impersonal sensationalism that it derides.' Some reviewers criticized the script. Wendy Ide of The Observer gave the film a negative review, writing that the film lacks the 'authentic anger' of The Big Short and the 'sniper-like accuracy' of Network, criticizing Clooney's 'complete lack of sincerity'. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that what the script lacks in 'emotional subtext' can be found in the cast's 'richly detailed' performances. In a mixed review, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called the film a 'raucous hostage thriller that eschews explanation for wish-fulfillment', concluding by saying that 'in the heat of the moment, Money Monster's bluster and nerve keeps you hooked.' Josh Lasser of IGN was critical of the film's mix of comedy and drama, calling the transitions 'too fast, ripping the audience out of the unfolding drama.' Despite comparisons of Clooney's character to Jim Cramer and his TV show Mad Money, Clooney and Foster denied this."

It was jointly produced by Trevor Macy through Intrepid Pictures and Jason Blum through Blumhouse Productions.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 12, 2016,[4] and was released by Netflix on April 8, 2016.[5] It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances and atmosphere.\n\nThe film has been remade twice in India, once as the Hindi-language film Khamoshi (June 2019), and again as the Tamil-language film Kolaiyuthir Kaalam (August 2019). Both remake films were directed by Chakri Toleti.[6][7] Midnight Mass, a miniseries based on the Hush story within a story of the same name, also created and directed by Flanagan, and starring Siegel, was released on Netflix on September 24, 2021.[8][9]\n\n## Plot\n\nDeaf-mute horror author Maddie Young lost her abilities to hear and speak after contracting bacterial meningitis at age 13, causing hearing loss and temporary vocal cord paresis which became permanent after an unsuccessful surgery.\n\nFollowing the critical acclaim of her novel Midnight Mass, Maddie has left New York City for a solitary life in the woods with her cat, struggling to write her next book. Her neighbor Sarah visits to return a copy of her novel, and they discuss Maddie's isolation and Sarah's desire to learn more sign language. Later that night, a masked killer with a crossbow chases a bloodied Sarah to Maddie's house, but her cries for help go unnoticed and the killer stabs Sarah to death.\n\nThe killer quickly deduces that Maddie is deaf and decides to make her his next victim. Sneaking inside, he steals her cell phone while she is on a laptop video call with her sister, Max, and takes pictures of Maddie which she receives on her computer. The killer reveals himself outside, stalking Maddie as she frantically locks her doors, before he cuts the house's power and punctures her car tires. Maddie writes \"won't tell, didn't see face, boyfriend coming home\" on the glass door with lipstick, but the killer responds by taking off his mask. Upon learning she can read lips, he threatens to take his time terrorizing her before eventually breaking in.\n\nTaunting Maddie by using Sarah's corpse to knock on a window, the killer is distracted when Maddie triggers her car alarm. She opens a window and tries to retrieve Sarah's phone, but the killer returns, and Maddie wounds him in the arm with a hammer before locking herself back inside. She soon slips outside and tries to run, but is forced back inside after narrowly avoiding the killer's arrows. Attempting to escape through a second-story window, Maddie is shot in the leg, but manages to knock the killer off the roof and steal his crossbow before retreating inside.\n\nWhile a badly wounded Maddie struggles to cock the crossbow, Sarah's boyfriend, John, arrives looking for Sarah. The killer poses as a police officer responding to a call, but John grows suspicious when the killer drops Sarah's earring, taken as a trophy. Before John can subdue the killer with a rock, Maddie inadvertently distracts him by banging on the window, and the killer fatally stabs him in the neck. A dying John puts the killer in a chokehold to allow Maddie to escape, but she realizes that she will either be caught or bleed to death; her only chance for survival is to fight.\n\nOutside, the killer prepares to kill Maddie's cat, but she shoots him in the shoulder with the crossbow. Racing inside, Maddie drops the last arrow and reaches for it, but the killer slams the sliding door on her wrist. Stomping on her arm, he allows Maddie to pull her mangled hand inside and lock the door. When he threatens to enter the house, Maddie writes \"do it, coward\" on the door with her own blood. As the killer bashes the door with a tire iron, Maddie uses her laptop to type up a description of the killer and a message to her family, before locking herself in the bathroom, armed with a knife.\n\nFailing to break through the door, the killer crashes through the bathroom skylight behind Maddie, unnoticed until he breathes on her neck. She stabs him in the knee and he pursues her to the kitchen, where she blinds him with insecticide and disorients him with her visual smoke alarm. He begins strangling her, but she impales him in the neck with a corkscrew, finally killing him. Retrieving her phone from his corpse, Maddie dials 9-1-1 and sits outside with her cat, smiling as the police arrive.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Kate Siegel as Madison \"Maddie\" Young\n- John Gallagher Jr. as The Man\n- Michael Trucco as John Stanley\n- Samantha Sloyan as Sarah Greene\n- Emma Graves as Max, Maddie's sister\n\n## Production\n\nNothing was known about the project until September 2015, when its existence was revealed at a buyers' screening at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[10] It was disclosed that Mike Flanagan had directed the film, and co-wrote it with his wife Kate Siegel, who also stars in it.[11]\n\nFlanagan said that he made the main character a deaf mute because he wanted to direct a film \"without dialogue\".[12] The possibility of making the film entirely silent was briefly considered, but was soon abandoned when Flanagan had decided that building tension with this limitation would be \"impossible\".[12] Flanagan also noted that the target audience would not have been used to silent films and, as such, would \"seek out every kind of audio stimulus anywhere else in the environment\" or simply choose to not watch the film.[12]\n\nThe script itself consisted largely of scene directions, which Flanagan and Siegel developed by acting out in their own house.[13] The fact that so much of the script was based around Flanagan and Siegel's house proved problematic for filming, as when they went to shoot the film in Alabama, they could not find a house similar enough to theirs and had to significantly alter the film's script.[14]  Flanagan also found challenges in the single location and had to plan the cinematography to keep the film interesting to the audience, especially given the mute nature of the protagonist; to this end, Flanagan used a Steadicam to follow Siegel's every move, along with a boom mic and a spotter, to make the movement more \"dynamic\".[14] The resulting audio for these scenes could not be used and had to be redone in post, with Flanagan noting that the audio initially \"sounded like a herd of elephants.\"[14]\n\nTo represent Maddie's world, various ambient sounds were used, such as the sound of ultrasound machines. Flanagan did not want to use pure silence for these scenes, as he still felt it would make viewers even more aware of their surroundings and take them out of the experience.[14]  As a result of the aforementioned camera set in, Siegel had to ADR her own breath into the final film.[14]  The film's soundtrack was composed by The Newton Brothers.[15]\n\n## Release\n\nHush had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 12, 2016.[4][16] Prior to the premiere, Netflix acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film, which it released on April 8.[17][18]\n\nOn April 7, 2023, the film was removed from Netflix as the company's distribution license expired. This was confirmed by Flanagan, stating \"they only licensed it for 7 years\", while also stating intentions of a physical release in the future.[19] Shout! Studios released the film  on video on demand on August 27, 2024,[20][21] prior to its limited theatrical release on October 16, 2024.[22]\n\n### Home media release\n\nA 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray collector's edition physical release from Shout! Studios was released on November 26, 2024, which included a never-before-seen, black-and-white \"Shush Cut\".[23]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Hush navigates the bloody waters of home invasion thrillers and incisive slashers for a contemporary horror puree.\"[24] At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on reviews from seven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[25]\n\nBenjamin Lee of The Guardian said that Hush \"offers ingenious suspense\" and awarded it four out of five stars.[26] Geoff Burkshire of Variety, though criticizing the film's third act, called it \"one of the more inspired concoctions to emerge from the busy Blumhouse horror-thriller assembly line in recent years.\"[27] Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave the film 3.5/4 stars, calling it \"a good old-fashioned truly scary movie\".[28] Jasef Wisener of TVOvermind gave the film a 4.7/5, noting that \"Thanks to the performances from its two leads, Hush succeeds in almost every aspect and delivers one of the best horror films in modern history.\"[29] Richard Newby of the website Audiences Everywhere called the film \"a modern slasher movie classic that's not to be missed.\"[30]\n\nStephen King wrote about the film on April 20, 2016, saying, \"How good is Hush? Up there with Halloween and, even more, Wait Until Dark. White knuckle time. On Netflix.\"[31] Filmmaker William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, also commented on the film, saying \"HUSH is a great horror film...on Netflix. Terrifying.\"[32]\n\n## Follow-ups\n\n### Remakes\n\nIn 2019, two separate remakes of Hush, directed by Chakri Toleti, were released in India: Kolaiyuthir Kaalam (Tamil) and Khamoshi (Hindi).[6][7]\n\n### Miniseries\n\nOn September 24, 2021, Midnight Mass, a miniseries based on the Hush story within a story of the same name (the internationally acclaimed novel by deaf-mute horror author protagonist Madison \"Maddie\" Young), also created and directed by Flanagan and starring Siegel, was released on Netflix.[8][9]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films featuring home invasions\n- List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing\n\n- List of films featuring psychopaths and sociopaths\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Hush (2016)\".

Attempting to escape through a second-story window, Maddie is shot in the leg, but manages to knock the killer off the roof and steal his crossbow before retreating inside.\n\nWhile a badly wounded Maddie struggles to cock the crossbow, Sarah's boyfriend, <Name>John</Name>, arrives looking for Sarah. The killer poses as a police officer responding to a call, but John grows suspicious when the killer drops Sarah's earring, taken as a trophy. Before John can subdue the killer with a rock, Maddie inadvertently distracts him by banging on the window, and the killer fatally stabs him in the neck. A dying John puts the killer in a chokehold to allow Maddie to escape, but she realizes that she will either be caught or bleed to death; her only chance for survival is to fight.\n\nOutside, the killer prepares to kill Maddie's cat, but she shoots him in the shoulder with the crossbow. Racing inside, Maddie drops the last arrow and reaches for it, but the killer slams the sliding door on her wrist. Stomping on her arm, he allows Maddie to pull her mangled hand inside and lock the door. When he threatens to enter the house, Maddie writes \"do it, coward\" on the door with her own blood. As the killer bashes the door with a tire iron, Maddie uses her laptop to type up a description of the killer and a message to her family, before locking herself in the bathroom, armed with a knife.\n\nFailing to break through the door, the killer crashes through the bathroom skylight behind Maddie, unnoticed until he breathes on her neck. She stabs him in the knee and he pursues her to the kitchen, where she blinds him with insecticide and disorients him with her visual smoke alarm. He begins strangling her, but she impales him in the neck with a corkscrew, finally killing him. Retrieving her phone from his corpse, Maddie dials 9-1-1 and sits outside with her cat, smiling as the police arrive.\n\n## Reception\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of <SuspenseFactor>91%</SuspenseFactor> based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.

Actually Matt Naylor has a screenwriting credit on both films, so it's hard to say which movie copied the other. While Alone has a good premise (like #Alive), it takes the wrong turn by offering us humiliating lead (sorry Posey), lazy story, apathetic \"suspenseful\" scenes and a love story that is nothing more than a mere fairytale. In the end I think Alone is more action driven, and #Alive has more character development.\n\n- andrewchristianjr\n- Nov 21, 2020\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ16\n\n- How long is Alone?Powered by Alexa\n- A U.S. Copy of #Alive 2020, South Korean Title #Saraitda September 8, 2020 Director Il Cho, Writers Il Cho (screenplay), Matt Naylor\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 16, 2020 (United States)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Official Amazon Link\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Final Days\n- Production companies\n    - ICM Partners\n    - JAR Films\n    - Martini Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $4,000,000 (estimated)\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 32 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat was the official certification given to Alone (2020) in Brazil?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The opening dream sequence draws the reader into a lost Garden of Eden, choked with malevolent ivy and twisted rhododendrons, from which the protagonists have been expelled and cannot return. And so, we find ourselves looking up at the blackened walls of Manderley, wondering what happened there.\n\nIt is a gripping story, a twisted Cinderella tale, in which the reader ends up colluding with the melodrama in such a way that they come to believe that murder, and the cover up, are somehow necessary and just.\n\nThe writer Daphne du Maurier was delighted with the 1940 movie adaptation, but even a transgressive director such as Alfred Hitchcock, baulked at the idea of making Maximilian de Winter a murderer. In the film version, Max recounts how he was taunted by Rebecca and that she slips, hitting her head, a far more acceptable Hollywood death than being shot through the heart.\n\nSince its publication, there has been much feminist criticism focusing on the novel's themes of power and privilege, reevaluating the held position that Rebecca is some kind of ‘wicked woman’. Meanwhile contemporary writers such as Susan Hill and Sally Beauman have come up with their own take on the story. Beauman's Rebecca's Tale was officially approved by the du Maurier estate and whilst it does a good job exploring Rebecca's psychological wounds, even her characters acknowledge that Rebecca's story may have some inconsistencies.\n\nDu Maurier's novel drip feeds us insights about Rebecca, mostly from people who were obsessed by her, or fail to love her complexity, and who would eventually destroy her. Their truth may be a little biased. This is the story of a woman who challenges societal norms, who conducts life by the adage ’I shall live as I please’, who enjoys sex and her body, and will not be controlled by men or a conventional marriage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRebecca is generally objectified and described as having ‘... breeding, brains and beauty ... a cloud of dark hair against very white skin.’ Frank Crawley muses, ‘I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.’ Whether she is dressed in riding habit or a black satin evening gown, she turns heads; her perfume is of white azaleas. We are told she makes people laugh, ‘she had an amazing gift of being attractive to people: men, women, children, dogs.’\n\nFor Du Maurier, all of this was something to be suspicious of. She had grown up in a family where attractive women were referred to as ‘a menace’. So, she makes Rebecca the archetypal ‘wicked woman’, an antenatal Medea character, who must die before she threatens the system of primogeniture, and the de Winter name.\n\nWe learn from Rebecca’s maid Mrs Danvers, that by the age of twelve, men were showing an interest in Rebecca. Her response, ‘I’m going to be a beauty, Danny?’ Of course, with our contemporary eye, we would be concerned about the appropriateness of this. Who was guiding Rebecca? Who was making sure she was safe?\n\nMrs Danvers recalls how a 16-year-old Rebecca disciplined her horse. ‘I can see her now, with her hair flying out behind her, slashing at him, drawing blood, digging the spurs into his side, and when she got off his back he was trembling all over, full of froth and blood. ‘That will teach him won’t it Danny?’\n\nRather than a clear cut case of nascent wickedness, these actions may also hint of someone who has experienced childhood trauma. We need to ask ourselves, who does that horse represent in that moment of sustained cruelty? What happened to Rebecca?\n\nNot that this concerns Du Maurier. For her, signs of childhood trauma - precocious sexuality and adolescent rage - are the evidence she needs of Rebecca’s malevolence. The metaphors of 'wickedness'- with its Christian connotations - are subtle and deftly delivered. She is condemned with the observation, ’there was something about her eyes’. Ben, the local man who spies on her down at the beach house, describes her as having ‘eyes like a snake’. Manderley is the Garden of Eden; at the end of the novel on the drive back from London, the narrator dreams of Maxim ‘brushing Rebecca’s hair, winding it into a thick rope, twisting it like a snake, putting it around his neck.’\n\nSally Beauman delves deeper into Rebecca's story: she reveals a bohemian Edwardian childhood, a mother swept up by a theatrical life, the hint of make-up in a photograph of Rebecca aged twelve, and the reliance on stage door Johnnies for financial support. Following her mother's premature death, a 14-year-old Rebecca is claimed by her father, a notorious buccaneer and gambler known as 'Black Jack' Devlin, who keeps her in a gilded, cosseted cage. What is hinted at is the sexual abuse Rebecca endures: 'Daddy tried to saddle me: bit, curb and bridle ... a ring on my wedding finger, bells on my toes: I'll make such a fine lady of you, Becka he'd say.'\n\nAs soon as she can, Rebecca escapes. She rescues herself. No mean feat for a woman in the early 20th Century. We have to imagine what path she takes next, for it is almost ten years before both du Maurier and Beauman pick up her story again, with Rebecca meeting Maximilian de Winter. We can picture her cutting her hair short, skippering a yacht around the Mediterranean. There are lovers, both men and women, and the complicity of strangers, but the shadow of her father looms large; relationships are complicated.\n\nAt night she is transformed, the satin evening gown and a waft of cigarette smoke is her armour. Her wit and intelligence draws people in, she uses that to keep them at bay. Whilst some see a ‘seductress’, what she is really manifesting is survival behaviour. Rebecca is unsure about her feelings. She wonders sometimes whether she has ever felt anything at all.\n\nMax is ten years older than her, and at first there is something of the benign father figure about him. His emotional unavailability is familiar. They have both suffered trauma. For Max, there was a brutal boarding school childhood and then the trenches of the First World War. Within these deep wounds, there is the potential for a healing relationship, if communication and connection are nurtured. There is also the potential for destruction.\n\nFive days after they are married, Rebecca tells Max her story. For the first time in her life, she feels ready to trust someone. She takes a risk, being vulnerable with someone she believes loves her, but she loses. Years later, Maxim will recount how Rebecca told him ‘... things I shall never repeat to a living soul.’ He does not have the emotional capacity to hold her trauma. It‘s not that he doesn’t want to, he can’t. Part of him wants to reach out to her, to rescue her, but he feels persecuted by what he knows about her. His own wounds and constructed sense of masculinity are threatened by Rebecca's story of sexual abuse, which he blames her for, and so he retreats, emotionally and physically, and eventually he believes he has to destroy her to save himself.\n\nDo not be fooled by Maxim’s later protestations that Rebecca is ‘vicious, damnable, rotten through and through ... that the marriage was a farce from the beginning ...' that ‘she was incapable of love, of tenderness, of decency’ ... that ‘she was not even normal.’ He would say that wouldn’t he. What happens is straightforward: patriarchal superiority and a fragile male ego leads to violence, and a man murdering a woman.\n\nThe opposite of love is not hate. It is fear. Maxim fears Rebecca. When the second Mrs de Winter breaks the Meissen figurine of Eros - with all it's associations of sex - Max is relieved, it feels like a spell has been broken, but of course he will never be free of Rebecca.\n\nTheir uneasy marriage is built out of the ancestral rubble that is Manderley. For Max, the ivy covered walls represent the sense of entombment he feels within their relationship. When Rebecca first sees Manderley’s faded, crumbling façade, she knows she has found home; a secure base and sanctuary. She senses the ghosts within its stones, and so she sets about rebuilding every part of the house, just as she tries to build the relationship with Max.

The opening dream sequence draws the reader into a lost Garden of Eden, choked with malevolent ivy and twisted rhododendrons, from which the protagonists have been expelled and cannot return. And so, we find ourselves looking up at the blackened walls of Manderley, wondering what happened there.</p>\n        \n        <p>It is a gripping story, a twisted Cinderella tale, in which the reader ends up colluding with the melodrama in such a way that they come to believe that murder, and the cover up, are somehow necessary and just.</p>\n        \n        <p>The writer Daphne du Maurier was delighted with the 1940 movie adaptation, but even a transgressive director such as <Director>Alfred Hitchcock</Director>, baulked at the idea of making Maximilian de Winter a murderer. In the film version, Max recounts how he was taunted by Rebecca and that she slips, hitting her head, a far more acceptable Hollywood death than being shot through the heart.</p>\n        \n        <p>Since its publication, there has been much feminist criticism focusing on the novel's themes of power and privilege, reevaluating the held position that Rebecca is some kind of ‘wicked woman’. Meanwhile contemporary writers such as <AdditionalInformation>Susan Hill</AdditionalInformation> and <AdditionalInformation>Sally Beauman</AdditionalInformation> have come up with their own take on the story. Beauman's <AdditionalInformation>Rebecca's Tale</AdditionalInformation> was officially approved by the du Maurier estate and whilst it does a good job exploring Rebecca's psychological wounds, even her characters acknowledge that Rebecca's story may have some inconsistencies.</p>\n        \n        <p>Du Maurier's novel drip feeds us insights about Rebecca, mostly from people who were obsessed by her, or fail to love her complexity, and who would eventually destroy her. Their truth may be a little biased. This is the story of a woman who challenges societal norms, who conducts life by the adage ’I shall live as I please’, who enjoys sex and her body, and will not be controlled by men or a conventional marriage.</p>\n        \n        <p>Rebecca is generally objectified and described as having ‘... breeding, brains and beauty ... a cloud of dark hair against very white skin.’ Frank Crawley muses, ‘I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.’ Whether she is dressed in riding habit or a black satin evening gown, she turns heads; her perfume is of white azaleas. We are told she makes people laugh, ‘she had an amazing gift of being attractive to people: men, women, children, dogs.’</p>\n        \n        <p>For Du Maurier, all of this was something to be suspicious of. She had grown up in a family where attractive women were referred to as ‘a menace’. So, she makes Rebecca the archetypal ‘wicked woman’, an antenatal Medea character, who must die before she threatens the system of primogeniture, and the de Winter name.</p>\n        \n        <p>We learn from Rebecca’s maid <AdditionalInformation>Mrs Danvers</AdditionalInformation>, that by the age of twelve, men were showing an interest in Rebecca. Her response, ‘I’m going to be a beauty, Danny?’ Of course, with our contemporary eye, we would be concerned about the appropriateness of this. Who was guiding Rebecca? Who was making sure she was safe?</p>\n        \n        <p>Mrs Danvers recalls how a 16-year-old Rebecca disciplined her horse. ‘I can see her now, with her hair flying out behind her, slashing at him, drawing blood, digging the spurs into his side, and when she got off his back he was trembling all over, full of froth and blood. ‘That will teach him won’t it Danny?’</p>\n        \n        <p>Rather than a clear cut case of nascent wickedness, these actions may also hint of someone who has experienced childhood trauma. We need to ask ourselves, who does that horse represent in that moment of sustained cruelty? What happened to Rebecca?</p>\n        \n        <p>Not that this concerns Du Maurier. For her, signs of childhood trauma - precocious sexuality and adolescent rage - are the evidence she needs of Rebecca’s malevolence. The metaphors of 'wickedness'- with its Christian connotations - are subtle and deftly delivered. She is condemned with the observation, ’there was something about her eyes’. Ben, the local man who spies on her down at the beach house, describes her as having ‘eyes like a snake’. Manderley is the Garden of Eden; at the end of the novel on the drive back from London, the narrator dreams of Maxim ‘brushing Rebecca’s hair, winding it into a thick rope, twisting it like a snake, putting it around his neck.’</p>\n        \n        <p>Sally Beauman delves deeper into Rebecca's story: she reveals a bohemian Edwardian childhood, a mother swept up by a theatrical life, the hint of make-up in a photograph of Rebecca aged twelve, and the reliance on stage door Johnnies for financial support. Following her mother's premature death, a 14-year-old Rebecca is claimed by her father, a notorious buccaneer and gambler known as 'Black Jack' Devlin, who keeps her in a gilded, cosseted cage. What is hinted at is the sexual abuse Rebecca endures: 'Daddy tried to saddle me: bit, curb and bridle ... a ring on my wedding finger, bells on my toes: I'll make such a fine lady of you, Becka he'd say.'</p>\n        \n        <p>As soon as she can, Rebecca escapes. She rescues herself. No mean feat for a woman in the early 20th Century. We have to imagine what path she takes next, for it is almost ten years before both du Maurier and Beauman pick up her story again, with Rebecca meeting Maximilian de Winter. We can picture her cutting her hair short, skippering a yacht around the Mediterranean. There are lovers, both men and women, and the complicity of strangers, but the shadow of her father looms large; relationships are complicated.</p>\n        \n        <p>At night she is transformed, the satin evening gown and a waft of cigarette smoke is her armour. Her wit and intelligence draws people in, she uses that to keep them at bay. Whilst some see a ‘seductress’, what she is really manifesting is survival behaviour. Rebecca is unsure about her feelings. She wonders sometimes whether she has ever felt anything at all.</p>\n        \n        <p>Max is ten years older than her, and at first there is something of the benign father figure about him. His emotional unavailability is familiar. They have both suffered trauma. For Max, there was a brutal boarding school childhood and then the trenches of the First World War. Within these deep wounds, there is the potential for a healing relationship, if communication and connection are nurtured. There is also the potential for destruction.</p>\n        \n        <p>Five days after they are married, Rebecca tells Max her story. For the first time in her life, she feels ready to trust someone. She takes a risk, being vulnerable with someone she believes loves her, but she loses. Years later, Maxim will recount how Rebecca told him ‘... things I shall never repeat to a living soul.’ He does not have the emotional capacity to hold her trauma. It‘s not that he doesn’t want to, he can’t. Part of him wants to reach out to her, to rescue her, but he feels persecuted by what he knows about her. His own wounds and constructed sense of masculinity are threatened by Rebecca's story of sexual abuse, which he blames her for, and so he retreats, emotionally and physically, and eventually he believes he has to destroy her to save himself.</p>\n        \n        <p>Do not be fooled by Maxim’s later protestations that Rebecca is ‘vicious, damnable, rotten through and through ... that the marriage was a farce from the beginning ...' that ‘she was incapable of love, of tenderness, of decency’ ... that ‘she was not even normal.’ He would say that wouldn’t he. What happens is straightforward: patriarchal superiority and a fragile male ego leads to violence, and a man murdering a woman.</p>\n        \n        <p>The opposite of love is not hate. It is fear. Maxim fears Rebecca. When the second Mrs de Winter breaks the Meissen figurine of Eros - with all its associations of sex - Max is relieved, it feels like a spell has been broken, but of course he will never be free of Rebecca.</p>\n        \n        <p>Their uneasy marriage is built out of the ancestral rubble that is Manderley. For Max, the ivy covered walls represent the sense of entombment he feels within their relationship. When Rebecca first sees Manderley’s faded, crumbling façade, she knows she has found home; a secure base and sanctuary. She senses the ghosts within its stones, and so she sets about rebuilding every part of the house, just as she tries to build the relationship with Max. His inability to love her complexity, trauma and brilliance is what destroys both of them and so Manderley must eventually be destroyed too.</p>\n    </content>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have tagged the relevant sections according to the attributes specified in the ADT.

                    "Plot": "In Monte Carlo, Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier) stops to speak to Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) only after recognizing her companion (Joan Fontaine), the woman he had encountered earlier. Maxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge, seemingly contemplating suicide. A young woman shouts at him to stop him in his tracks, but he curtly asks her to walk on. Later, at a Monte Carlo hotel, the same young woman, serving as a paid companion to the pompous aging Mrs. Van Hopper, again encounters the debonair widower de Winter. Aspiring to social prominence, Mrs. Van Hopper is obsequious to the aristocratic de Winter, but is soon confined to her room due to illness. Maxim invites the companion on excursions, which she conceals from her employer as tennis lessons, and the young woman soon becomes infatuated, though puzzled by such attention. On her recovery, Mrs. Van Hopper decides to leave Monte Carlo; her companion furtively informs Maxim of her departure, and Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. After being informed of the proposal by Maxim, a shocked Mrs. Van Hopper privately tells her companion that Maxim is marrying her as a desperate distraction because he is still tormented by thoughts of his beloved dead wife, Rebecca. She asserts that her companion is ill-prepared to be the second Mrs. de Winter and cannot hope to succeed as the mistress of the stately Manderley. Maxim brings his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in Cornwall. Manderley is dominated by its austere housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a cold and unyielding woman who had once been a confidante of the first Mrs. de Winter. Danvers harbors a deep resentment for the new Mrs. de Winter, whom she views as a usurper. Danvers feeds the bride's insecurity by showing her Rebecca's grand bedroom suite, left untouched and off-limits to the new wife, and by retaining items throughout the house that carry Rebecca's monogram. Eventually, constant reminders of Rebecca's glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his tragically drowned first wife, which could explain his restlessness and irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to assert her new role by holding a costume party as Maxim and Rebecca had done annually. Danvers suggests she copy the dress that one of Maxim's ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. However, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. When Mrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window of Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog and, during the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat with Rebecca's body in it has been discovered. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When Rebecca implied she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim's line. During a heated argument, Rebecca fell, struck her head, and died. Afraid he would be blamed for her death, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled; some days later, he identified another body that washed ashore as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her naïve ways. When the inquest considers the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, threatening to reveal a letter from Rebecca hinting at a pregnancy that made suicide improbable. When Maxim informs the police of the attempted blackmail, they must investigate Favell's accusations that Maxim murdered Rebecca. Further investigation with a doctor, however, reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her to ruin him. As a free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.",

It follows Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), an attorney who cheats on his wife Beth (Anne Archer) with a colleague, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). When Dan decides to end the affair, Alex grows increasingly unstable and begins stalking him and his family.\n\nFatal Attraction was released in the United States on September 18, 1987. It grossed $320 million on a $14 million production budget, becoming the second highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. It received acclaim, with particular praise for its direction, editing, screenplay, and performances. It received six nominations at the 60th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Lyne, Best Actress for Close, and Best Supporting Actress for Archer. Considered a pop culture phenomenon in the years since its release, the film is also credited for triggering the erotic thriller boom of the late 1980s to the mid 1990s.[3]\n\nA play based on the film opened in London's West End at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2014. In 2023, a television adaptation was broadcast on Paramount+.\n\n## Plot\n\nDan Gallagher is an attorney from Manhattan. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town visiting Beth's family, he has an affair with Alex Forrest, an editor for a publishing company. Alex begins to cling to him. Dan reluctantly spends the following day with Alex. When he tries to leave, she cuts her wrists. Dan helps her and leaves in the morning.\n\nAlex comes to Dan's office to apologize. He declines her invitation to a performance of Madame Butterfly. She continues to call him at his office until he informs his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex insists that Dan meet her and tells him she is pregnant, arguing that he must take responsibility. After Dan changes their phone number, Alex meets Beth, who has advertised selling their apartment, pretending to be interested in buying it. That night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her and they get into a scuffle.\n\nDan, Beth and Ellen move to Bedford. Alex has a tape recording of herself delivered to him, which is full of verbal abuse. She stalks him, pours acid onto his car and follows him home later that evening. The sight of his happy family through their window makes her vomit. Dan approaches the police to file a restraining order, claiming it is for a client. The lieutenant informs him that he cannot violate Alex's rights without probable cause, and that the client must own up to his adultery.\n\nWhen Dan, Beth and Ellen return home, they discover Alex has boiled Ellen's pet rabbit on their stove. Dan confesses the affair and Alex's pregnancy to Beth. Enraged, Beth orders him to leave. Dan calls Alex to say Beth knows about the affair. Beth takes the phone and tells Alex that she will kill her if Alex comes near their family again. Alex picks Ellen up from her school and kidnaps her, taking her to an amusement park. Beth drives around frantically looking for her and gets into an accident, requiring hospitalization. Alex returns Ellen home unharmed.\n\nAfter visiting Beth in the hospital, Dan forcibly enters Alex's apartment and attempts to strangle her, but stops short of killing her. She grabs a kitchen knife and lunges at him, but he disarms her and leaves. The police search for Alex after Dan reports the kidnapping. Beth forgives Dan, and they return home after Beth is discharged from the hospital. While Beth prepares to take a bath, Alex attacks her with a knife. Dan rushes upstairs, subdues Alex and appears to drown her in the bathtub, but she emerges swinging the knife. Beth shoots her dead. Dan completes his statement to the police and joins Beth in the living room.\n\n## Cast\n\nDouglas as Dan Gallagher\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Michael Douglas as Dan Gallagher\n- Glenn Close as Alex Forrest\n- Anne Archer as Beth Rogerson Gallagher\n- Ellen Hamilton Latzen as Ellen Gallagher\n- Stuart Pankin as Jimmy\n- Ellen Foley as Hildy\n- Fred Gwynne as Arthur, Dan's boss\n- Meg Mundy as Joan Rogerson\n- Tom Brennan as Howard Rogerson\n- Lois Smith as Martha, Dan's secretary\n- Mike Nussbaum as Bob Drimmer\n- J.

In Meyer's book The View from the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood, he explains that in late 1986 producer Stanley R. Jaffe asked him to look at the script developed by Dearden, and he wrote a four-page memo making suggestions, including a new ending. John Carpenter was approached to direct the film, but turned it down as he felt it was too similar to Play Misty for Me (1971).[6] A few weeks later Meyer met with the director Adrian Lyne and gave him some additional suggestions. Meyer was asked to redraft the script to create the shooting script.\n\n### Casting\n\nProducers Sherry Lansing and Stanley R. Jaffe both had serious doubts about casting Glenn Close because they did not think she could be sexual enough. Instead, they had many other actresses in mind.[7] Barbara Hershey was originally considered; she wanted the role but she was unavailable.[8] Several actresses auditioned for the part, but they were almost all turned down.[8] Lyne had French actress Isabelle Adjani in mind for the role.[9] Tracey Ullman was approached for the role, but she declined due to a scene in the script where the character boils a bunny.[10] Miranda Richardson also turned it down as she found it \"hideous.\"[11] Ellen Barkin, Debra Winger, Susan Sarandon, Jessica Lange, Judy Davis, Melanie Griffith and Michelle Pfeiffer were also considered for the role.[12][13] Kirstie Alley auditioned for the role.[12] Close was persistent, and after meeting with Jaffe several times in New York, she was asked to fly out to Los Angeles to read with Michael Douglas in front of Adrian Lyne and Lansing. Before the audition, she let her naturally frizzy hair \"go wild\" because she was impatient at putting it up, and she wore a slimming black dress she thought made her look \"fabulous\" to the audition.[14] This impressed Lansing, because Close \"came in looking completely different... right away she was into the part.\"[15] Close and Douglas performed a scene from early in the script, where Alex flirts with Dan in a café, and Close came away \"convinced my career was over, that I was finished, I had completely blown my chances\".[7] Lansing and Lyne were both convinced she was right for the role; Lyne stated that \"an extraordinary erotic transformation took place. She was this tragic, bewildering mix of sexuality and rage—I watched Alex come to life.\"[16]\n\nTo prepare for her role, Close consulted several psychologists, hoping to understand Alex's psyche and motivations. She was uncomfortable with the bunny boiling scene, which she thought was too extreme, but she was assured on consulting the psychologists that such an action was entirely possible and that Alex's behavior corresponded to someone who had experienced incestual sexual abuse as a child.[7][17] While filming her death scene, Close suffered a concussion and was hospitalized. She later found out that she was pregnant during filming.[18]\n\n### Alternate ending\n\nAlex was originally scripted slashing her throat at the film's end with the knife Dan had left on the counter, so as to make it appear that Dan had murdered her. After seeing her husband being taken away by police, Beth finds a revealing cassette tape that Alex sent Dan in which she threatens to kill herself. Beth takes the tape to the police, who clear Dan of the murder. The last scene shows, in flashback, Alex taking her own life by slashing her throat while listening to Madame Butterfly.\n\nWhen the film was test-screened for audiences, the ending was poorly received as audiences disliked the idea of Alex triumphing in the end. After doing test screenings, Joseph Farrell (who handled the test screenings) suggested that Paramount shoot a new ending. While Douglas approved of changing the ending as he believed it was \"best for the film\", most of the cast and crew disliked the idea. Archer was \"appalled\" by the change and burst into tears when she heard the news. Close had doubts, believing Alex would \"self-destruct and commit suicide\".[19] Lyne initially refused to change the ending until Lansing offered him an additional $1.5 million salary, while Dearden reluctantly agreed to write the new ending believing the film would be a bigger hit if changed.[20][21][22]\n\nClose fought against the change for two weeks before eventually giving in on her concerns and filming the new sequence after William Hurt convinced her to do it.[19][5] Though the ending was not the one she preferred, she acknowledged that the film would not have been as successful without it, because it gave the audience \"a sense of catharsis, a hope, that somehow the family unit would survive the nightmare\".[7]\n\nWhile Lyne has stood by the theatrical ending believing it was a \"good idea\", Dearden and Close have continued to express their dismay.[23] In 2010, during a cast reunion interview, Close shared that she \"never thought of [her character] as a villain\"[24] and said: \"I wasn't playing a generality. I wasn't playing a cliché. I was playing a very specific, deeply disturbed, fragile human being, whom I had grown to love.\"[7] Close also stated that she doesn't think the film would have been a hit without the \"new\" ending.[25] In 2014, Dearden penned a piece for The Guardian stating that while he does not regret writing the story, he does express his regret for the theatrical ending believing it to be sexist and the way Alex was portrayed in it stating that he didn't want to make her a monster but rather \"a sad, tragic, lonely woman, holding down a tough job in an unforgiving city.\" When adapting his script to the stage, he opted to lean away from making her a villain and more a tragic figure.[26]\n\nThe film's first Japanese release used the original ending. The original ending also appeared on a special edition VHS and LaserDisc release by Paramount in 1992, and was included on the film's DVD release a decade later.[27]\n\n### Home media\n\nA Special Collector's Edition of the film was released on DVD in 2002.[28] Paramount released Fatal Attraction on Blu-ray Disc on June 9, 2009.[29] The Blu-ray contained several bonus features from the 2002 DVD, including commentary by director Adrian Lyne, cast and crew interviews, a look at the film's cultural phenomenon, a behind-the-scenes look, rehearsal footage, the alternative ending, and the original theatrical trailer. In April 2020 a remastered Blu-ray Disc was released by Paramount Home Entertainment under their Paramount Presents series. Included was a new interview with the director titled Filmmaker Focus, previous rehearsal footage but excluding some of the extra features from previous releases.[30] Paramount released the film on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in the U.S. on September 13, 2022.[31]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nFatal Attraction grossed $156.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $163.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $320.1 million.[2][32]\n\nThe film spent eight weeks at number one in the United States, where it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1987, behind Three Men and a Baby.[33] In the United Kingdom, it grossed a record £2,048,421 in its opening week and spent ten weeks at number one.[34] In Australia, it was the first non-Australian film to gross A$2 million in its opening week, second to Crocodile Dundee.[35] Fatal Attraction eventually became the highest-grossing film worldwide in 1987.[36]\n\n### Nominations\n\nFatal Attraction received 6 nominations at the 60th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Lyne), Best Actress (Close) and Best Supporting Actress (Archer), but failed to win any. At the 42nd British Academy Film Awards, the film won Best Editing, while earning nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Douglas) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Archer). It also received four nominations at the 45th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director (Lyne), Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Close) and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (Archer).\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of 61 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"A potboiler in the finest sense, Fatal Attraction is a sultry, juicy thriller that's hard to look away from once it gets going.\"[37] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[38] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an F to A+ scale.[39]\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times lauded Lyne's direction, writing that he \"takes a brilliantly manipulative approach to what might have been a humdrum subject and shapes a soap opera of exceptional power. Most of that power comes directly from visual imagery, for Mr. Lyne is well versed in making anything – a person, a room, a pile of dishes in a kitchen sink – seem tactile, rich and sexy.\"[40] Richard Schickel of Time stated that Close and Douglas \"gives the film some of its fatal attractiveness. So do James Dearden's plausible, nicely observant script, Adrian Lyne's elegantly unforced direction, and Close's beautifully calibrated descent into lunacy. Together they bring horror home to a place where the grownup moviegoer actually lives.\"[41]\n\nAuthor Susan Faludi discussed the film in Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, arguing that major changes had been made to the original plot in order to make Alex wholly negative, while Dan's carelessness and the lack of compassion and responsibility raised no discussion, except for a small number of men's groups who said that Dan was eventually forced to own up to his irresponsibility in that \"everyone pays the piper\".[42] Close was quoted in 2008 as saying, \"Men still come up to me and say, 'You scared the shit out of me.' Sometimes they say, 'You saved my marriage.'\"[43] Critic Barry Norman expressed sympathy for feminists who were frustrated by the film, criticized its \"over-the-top\" ending and called it inferior to Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me, which has a similar plot. Nonetheless, he declared it \"strong and very well made, excellently played by the three main characters and neatly written.\"[44] Fatal Attraction has been described as a neo-noir film by some authors.[45]\n\nFatal Attraction was the first American film to be distributed by United International Pictures in South Korea. In September 1988, Korean film distributors protested this release by \"releasing snakes, setting fire in the theatres, and tearing off the screens.\"[46]\n\nPsychiatrists and film experts have analyzed the character of Alex Forrest and used her as an illustration of borderline personality disorder.[47] She exhibits impulsive behavior, emotional instability, a fear of abandonment, frequent episodes of intense anger, self-harming, and shifting between idealization and devaluation of others, all of which are characteristic of the disorder. The degree to which she displays these traits is not necessarily typical, and aggression in people with borderline personality disorder is often directed toward themselves rather than others.[48] Slant Magazine named her role one the \"15 Famous Movie Psychopaths\", and WhatCulture included it in top \"10 Most Convincing Movie Psychopath Performances\"[49][50]\n\nAs referenced in Orit Kamir's Every Breath You Take: Stalking Narratives and the Law, \"Glenn Close's character Alex is quite deliberately made to be an erotomaniac.\" Gelder reports that Close \"consulted three separate shrinks for an inner profile of her character, who is meant to be suffering from a form of an obsessive condition known as de Clérambault's syndrome\" (Gelder 1990, 93–94).[51] The term \"bunny boiler\" is used to describe an obsessive, spurned woman, deriving from the scene where it is discovered that Alex has boiled the family's pet rabbit.[52][53][54][55]\n\n### Accolades and honors\n\n| Award                                  | Category                                                                                        | Nominee(s)                           | Result    | Ref.    |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Academy Awards                         | Best Picture                                                                                    | Stanley R.

The premise is fairly original (although Hitchcock's \"Rope\" inmediately comes to mind), the pace is fine, and the acting is overall great, with a 22-year old Ryan Gosling standing out in his multi-layered portrayal of the self-assured, manipulative, spoilt rich kid Richard. And in my opinion Sandra Bullock did a pretty convincing job (while watching her is by the way always a treat). I even liked the cliché shoot-out ending, it gave this otherwise low-on-action movie an exciting finale.\n\nWhat did annoy me however, was the way Bullock's character detective Cassie Mayweather was written. Why this elaborate traumatic background?! It did not serve any purpose for the central story of the movie (the ordeal in her past being totally different from the crime that she now had to investigate) but did take lots of screentime. I guess it had to explain her cranky behavior, and maybe her apparent casual attitude to sex. But she was also pictured as a brilliant professional detective. So why this totally inappropriate sexual harrassment of her newbie partner? Or the innuendos of a sensual attraction towards her major crime-suspect?\n\nIt's a strange convention in so many crime-movies, that detectives on duty have to have some troublesome past or an addiction or a conflicting bad divorce or whatever, I always yawn when yet another one of these traumatized police-officers comes along. Either make it essential to the story, or leave it, I would say.\n\nAnyway, as an interesting psychological portrayal of two young wannabe killers, and as an extended well-acted CSI episode, it made for an entertaining but slightly overlong two hours.\n\n- johannes2000-1\n- Jun 21, 2022\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ30\n\n- How long is Murder by Numbers?Powered by Alexa\n- What is \"Murder by Numbers\" about?\n- Is \"Murder by Numbers\" based on a book?\n- What does the title mean?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 29, 2002 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official site\n    - Warner Bros (United States)\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Foolproof\n- Filming locations\n    - San Luis Obispo, California, USA\n- Production companies\n    - Warner Bros.\n    - Castle Rock Entertainment\n    - Schroeder Hoffman Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $50,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $31,945,749\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $9,307,394\n    - Apr 21, 2002\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $56,714,147\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 55 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - DTS\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - SDDS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Hindi language plot outline for Murder by Numbers (2002)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I had high hopes for Tau, the sci-fi film recently advertised upon logging into Netflix. The trailer looked great. The lighting is weird and cool, and there’s Maika Monroe, who was wonderful in It Follows, one of the best horror films in recent years. Between the huge, futuristic mansion and the artificial intelligence theme, it looked like a cool Ex Machina-esque story. It was not.\n\nThe movie begins with Julia (wearing a badass dress and really cool wig) seducing men and stealing their phones and wallets out of their pockets to turn around and sell the items for cash. When she gets to her apartment, we see her put the cash in a savings jar and then quickly get abducted. At this point, I was in. I was glad the movie didn’t waste time getting her into the crazy mansion we were promised in the trailer.\n\nJulia wakes up with something over her face preventing her from screaming, and she apparently undergoes some kind of painful shock thing while restrained to a high-tech chair. It seems to make a lot of her memories flash before eyes, and because this happened, I figured these memories would become important later on. Spoiler: they don’t.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThen she’s in a concrete cell, still with her face covered and her hands zip-tied at the wrists. She discovers two other prisoners and notices the back of their necks have a green glow to them like something has been inserted under their skin. She feels her own neck to discover the same thing. When she goes back to the chair for more weird shock stuff and meaningless memory flashes, she steals some scissors to cut off her mask. She frees the other two prisoners from their constraints, and the three of them make the world’s most implausible escape involving shredded pieces of fabric from their “prison suits.” I won’t spoil this one. You should just watch this part to see how to escape from this very specific situation.\n\nWhen the three of them try to exit the house through the front door, they discover it requires handprint recognition. When the male prisoner tries to scan his own hand, an obnoxious-looking art sculpture comes to life and kills him. Think Transformers but for house art. Then it kills the other female prisoner.  Julia is spared at the last minute by a voice commanding, “Tau, STOP.” And here we see Alex for the first time.\n\nAlex is a weirdo millionaire who has been on the cover of Wired magazine and every other important tech publication on the planet. Yet he seems like he’s never interacted with another human being in his life. The killer art sculpture/transformer takes commands from Alex and lets Julia go. And has to kind of “explain” what happened to the other two prisoners, who left a lot of damn blood in the living room. Julia gets tied to a taller piece of art (?) and some tiny drones fly out and clean up the mess. Think Dorothy II from Twister. Like those little sensor things. That’s what these drones look like. Wait, maybe this is a sequel to Twister…\n\nEd Skrein and Maika Monroe and Alex and Julia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSo when Alex goes to “work” during the day (Which I have an issue with because he can video conference from home and apparently hasn’t set foot inside the boardroom in recent memory, according to the other board members…so where the hell is he going??), we find out that Tau, one of the most advanced AI systems in the world, cleans the whole house using the drones and prepares dinner for Alex and greets him like an enslaved wife whose only job was to put the food on the table.\n\nSomewhere in here, Alex explains to Julia, aka Subject 3, that he needs her to complete tasks and tests while he is away at work to test her cognitive abilities. From what I could gather, these tests are used to learn about human cognition in order to improve the AI system. This undertaking is due in a few days, and it seems Alex hasn’t made sufficient progress. Why people would need to be KIDNAPPED in order to take these tests instead of doing like, oh, I don’t know, let’s say, a CLINICAL TRIAL, is beyond me.\n\nSo basically she can be unrestrained during the day if she’s doing her tasks with Tau in the atrium of the house (yeah, it has an atrium), and Tau’s job is to keep her in line or else he’ll (it’ll?) have to “inflict pain” on Julia/Subject 3. But Julia and Tau start talking when she tells Tau not to call her Subject 3 because she is a person. Then Tau asks, “What is a person?” and all hell breaks loose. And by “hell,” I mean a string of very simple questions that continue throughout the rest of the film.\n\nJulia starts to teach Tau about the world outside of the mansion through books, drawings, and music. Because apparently Tau “likes” music? How? Tau begins to think it is also a person. Julia is able to manipulate Tau by making him trust her somehow. And he seems to like her? I don’t get where the emotional stuff comes in because as far as I could tell from the tasks, human emotion wasn’t one of the desired functions of Tau. But honestly I don’t know at this point. Sigh.\n\nMaika Monroe as Julia/Subject 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHere is where I started to be like, “Wait, what even IS Tau?” He’s this system she can talk to from wherever in the house but seems to have a home base by the fireplace. He controls the drones (or he is also the drones?), and he controls the murderous art transformer (or he is the art?). He can make dinner for Alex. He’s allegedly the smartest AI system on the planet, but he really can’t grasp basic concepts like “What is a tree?” And Alex is like…weirdly abusive to him. If something isn’t cleaned, Alex erases some of Tau’s memory. I have several issues with this. 1) Tau screams like this hurts. How is he feeling physical pain? He has no physical being. 2) If this project has to be unveiled soon, isn’t erasing the prototype’s memory only screwing up Alex’s own project? 3) It’s unclear what is actually getting erased. Is it Alex’s programming? Is it the stuff Julia is teaching him, like what a tree is and what is outside the house? Tau still seems to “feel” a kinship with Julia even after his punishments.\n\nNow is a good time to mention that Tau is voiced by GARY OLDMAN.\n\nWhy is Gary Oldman in this movie?! The level of complexity of Gary Oldman’s dialogue never surpassed “For dinner, we have Chilean sea bass, Alex” and “Am I a person?” And speaking of robots, Alex is the most wooden character in the world, and I don’t mean that as a compliment to the actor for conveying how weird he is. He literally seems like he is an AI system himself. Which I thought would be a big reveal. Like, what if Tau was being tested on the house but actually this humanoid robot is the end game experiment? (FYI Netflix, that’s a better movie. Hit me up next time.)\n\nTau sort of forms a human shape at one point.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnyway, Tau and Julia kind of “team up” in a series of miracle near-misses at the end of the film. Julia is able to pickpocket Alex and attack him (the pickpocket move is literally the only time her outside life is relevant to what happens in the house). Tau’s memory is almost totally gone, so he’s coming after Julia but still kind of seems to not “want” to. I’m hesitant to even say that because honestly I don’t know what he was doing at this point. But anyway, she’s able to escape to Alex’s bedroom and start a program that makes the house self-destruct, which Tau told her about in secret. Why he would tell her that is unclear. He couldn’t be programmed to keep that info on lock? Robot Gary Oldman is not the best AI ever.\n\nAnyway, the house starts crumbling. Somehow Alex is alive after being slashed with a knife and he’s trying to crawl to safety but is crushed by falling concrete (not sorry for this spoiler; it’s dumb). Julia of course is hit by nothing on the way out, and then we see she made it out with one of the drones. She’s able to reach Tau through the drone and show him the world she’d been telling him about this whole time.\n\nAs dumb as the whole house destruction was, I actually did kind of like the end, but I’m still confused about how Tau got out in the drone because the program was also supposed to destroy him. Anyway, I guess now he remembers stuff again? It’s all unclear, but I like the idea of her kind of “saving” Tau.\n\nA couple other issues that I didn’t know where to put:\n\n1)      The lighting in this is so odd. It’s like mostly red, blue, or gold lighting everywhere. At first I was kind of into it because I was trying to figure out what cool thing this was doing with the story, but I concluded there really wasn’t much of a reason.\n\n2)      The person I watched with pointed out how weird it is that Alex didn’t have surveillance cameras in his home to make sure Julia stayed in the atrium. And that got me thinking: Wait. This guy has a smart house, but there was nothing watching the subjects while they were in their jail cell making this long escape? There’s no way if the subjects were that precious that you’d leave them wholly unattended without surveillance. Just saying.\n\nOne of the cool things about AI/robot stuff is that it makes the audience question what it means to human. But Tau mostly just made me question the logic of the movie. Gonna give this a 2/5 stars, and the two stars are for Maika Monroe, Gary Oldman, and Julia saving Tau. In conclusion, you should probably just watch Ex Machina again instead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Squad likes to talk about more than just books.

I knew these ratings were unfair, so I decided to give the movie a shot. Honestly, the movie is decent-I'd rate it a 5 or 6.

The film stars Chris Hemsworth, Miles Teller, and Jurnee Smollett. The story follows inmates in a luxurious prison who participate in experiments involving mind-altering drugs. Principal photography took place in Australia in 2020.\n\nSpiderhead premiered in Sydney on June 11, 2022, and was released on Netflix on June 17. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nSpiderhead is a state of the art penitentiary experimenting with the effects of research chemicals. The test subjects, technically prisoners of the state, are volunteers for the project aiming to reduce their sentence time. The program is overseen by the sympathetic and hospitable Steve Abnesti, along with his assistant Mark. The prisoners have their own rooms, do chores, and are free to roam without guard supervision. The subjects go through daily test runs of various drugs, all of which alter their emotions and their perceptions of their surroundings.\n\nInmate Jeff, still reeling from having killed his friend whilst drunk driving, is given N-40, a \"love drug\", which distorts his senses and drives him to have sex with two of his fellow inmates. Steve asks him to choose which one of them to give Darkenfloxx, a drug that induces intense fear and psychological pain. He declines to choose, claiming he feels nothing in particular for either one of them after the effects of the love drug had worn off. Mark helps Steve administer some N-40 to himself.\n\nThe next day, Steve brings Jeff into the observation room and tells him that the \"higher ups\" have decided that the younger of the two women, Heather, must be injected with a dose, though it will only last 5 minutes. Jeff reluctantly agrees, and to his horror, Heather commits suicide while on the Darkenfloxx after she damages her MobiPak, the device that administers the drugs. This causes Mark to doubt their work in the facility. As Steve rushes out of the projection room, he drops his keys. Jeff unlocks Steve's desk compartment, discovering that there are no \"higher-ups\": the prison is run by Abnesti Pharmaceuticals, Steve's company. The drugs were named from a bingo card.\n\nSteve and Jeff get high together on a laughing drug, as Steve also has a MobiPak installed. Steve tells Jeff that his father abandoned him as a child. Jeff confesses to Lizzy, an inmate he is close with, that he not only killed his friend in the car accident but his girlfriend as well. Lizzy hugs him and they kiss. Steve notices Jeff's feelings for Lizzy. Mark becomes doubtful of Steve's motives, and he breaks down when Jeff confronts him.\n\nWhen Steve asks Jeff to administer Darkenfloxx to Lizzy, Jeff takes control of Steve's MobiPak, reveals that Mark has spiked his Mobipak with Darkenfloxx, and forces him to admit the true goal of the program: testing a compliance drug, B-6. The other drugs are merely side projects being used to put B-6 to the ultimate test: whether or not they would harm their love when commanded to. The entire time inmates had been consenting to the various tests, they had really been under the influence of the obedience drug. In addition, Steve informs Jeff that he had in fact finished his sentence seven months previously, while Lizzy's appeal for release had passed the previous week. Jeff forces Steve to open the door of the main entrance to free Lizzy and then tries to order him to hand over the pocket knife. Steve resists the order (as complying would be killing the project, \"the only thing he has ever loved\"), and instead takes his phone and enables all four vials of Darkenfloxx in Lizzy's MobiPak, causing her to behave hysterically and attempt suicide. The two fight for control and Jeff is able to disarm Steve, damaging his MobiPak in the process. Jeff rushes to save Lizzy, successfully removes the vials of Darkenfloxx and tells her he loves her, but Steve gets up and orders the other inmates to apprehend Jeff and Lizzy. They are able to escape from Spiderhead after overpowering some of the other inmates and locking the main door behind them. Mark and the police are now approaching the island as Steve escapes on his floatplane, but he joyously crashes into a mountain as he is now high off of his damaged MobiPak.  Meanwhile, Jeff and Lizzy take the remaining motorboat and escape.\n\nIn a voice-over, Jeff comments that no drug can bestow self-forgiveness, instead it must be worked on and chosen.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Chris Hemsworth as Steve Abnesti\n- Miles Teller as Jeff\n- Jurnee Smollett as Lizzy\n- Mark Paguio as Mark Verlaine\n- Tess Haubrich as Heather\n- Angie Milliken as Sarah\n- Stephen Tongun as Ray\n- Daniel Reader as Ryan\n- Sam Delich as Adam\n- BeBe Bettencourt as Emma\n- Joey Vieira as Miguel\n- Ron Smyck as Dave\n- Nathan Jones as Rogan\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\n\"Escape from Spiderhead\" was first published in The New Yorker in 2010, and in author George Saunders's collection of short stories Tenth of December in 2013. A film adaptation was announced in February 2019 with Joseph Kosinski set to direct from a screenplay written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.[1] In September 2020, Chris Hemsworth, Miles Teller and Jurnee Smollett joined the cast.[3] Teller and Kosinski previously worked together on Top Gun: Maverick, the sequel to 1986 film Top Gun.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming took place at the Hinze Dam in Queensland, Australia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in early November 2020[4] in Queensland, Australia,[5] in November 2020 following a AU$21.58 million investment from the Australian Government, shared with the production of Pieces of Her (lured to Sydney from British Columbia, Canada), to boost the national economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.[6] Queensland Premier Annastacia Pałaszczuk said the production would create 360 local jobs and be worth around AUD$47 million to the local economy.[7]\n\nLocations for filming included the Gold Coast, Darlington, as well as popular tourist destination the Whitsundays.[8] Producer Tommy Harper commented on the locations, “The great thing about this area is you can be on the beach, you can do waterwork, you can be in the desert, you could be in the country and feel like you’re in Texas, you can be in a rainforest and feel like you’re in Hawaii.”[8] Filming also took place at Hinze Dam and Tallebudgera Valley.[8]\n\n## Release\n\nAs part of a video and letter to its shareholders in April 2021, Netflix's co-chief executive officer and chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, confirmed that the film was expected to premiere in the fourth quarter of 2021.[9][5] In April 2022, the film was confirmed to be scheduled for release on June 17, 2022.[10] The world premiere was held at The Entertainment Quarter in Sydney, Australia, on June 11, 2022.[11]\n\n## Reception\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 39% of 152 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Spiderhead's top-shelf cast and well-written source material are almost enough to compensate for its frequent failure to live up to its potential.\"[12] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[13] Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave it 2 out of 4 stars, writing that \"it starts with promise\", but is \"pseudo-heady sci-fi stuff that treats its most intriguing elements like an afterthought.\"[14]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c Fleming, Mike Jr. (February 1, 2019). \"Netflix Sets Joseph Kosinski To Follow 'Top Gun 2' With Wernick &amp;amp; Reese-Scripted 'Spiderhead'\".

Strong characters, with a complex psychological background that makes it believable that they do what they do. Bracha delivers a top performance, and Elise is good as usual.\n\nWe couldn't see any surreal plotholes or silliness from the main character. Under normal circumstances people may choose differently, but here its not clear whom to trust. The idea that a judge would fall through the cracks and find herself in a position of suspicion makes it extra interesting.\n\nThis movie maintained a constant tension of \"what will happen next?\". While some critics called it painfully slow we didn't experience that at all. Instead, it's never clear what will happen next or how the story will end. This kept us hooked in.\n\nThe end isnt your typical ending, which is something I love to see, but its wrap up was very brief and could have used an extra scene or two. Overall enjoyed a good movie night!\n\n- vdboor-06788\n- Dec 27, 2022\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ15\n\n- How long is Faithfully Yours?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 17, 2023 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - Netherlands\n- Language\n    - Dutch\n- Also known as\n    - Sadakat Yalanı\n- Production company\n    - Millstreet Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $1,843,824\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 35 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.35 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Japanese language plot outline for Faithfully Yours (2022)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I live in the Netherlands and only can get copies of Hindi movies. So without having any knowledge about the story I could watch this movie with fresh eyes and just loved it. The trailer is very misleading and letting people believe that it is a comedy. And I was glad that it wasn't. It is a real good suspense movie. Not in the sense that it was thrilling every minute. But you just feel that something is up. The comedy and horror elements are there to put you off course. I love the fact that they play around with superstition, religion and science. It is quite a remarkable psychological thriller. Be honest. There aren't many Indian movies like this compared to Hollywood movies. Not one minute I got bored with this movie. And let me tell you that is saying something. I have seen a lot of (American, Korean, Japanese, British, Dutch and Hong Kong) movies this year and with most of them I was very disappointed. And now you have 'Om Shanti Om', 'Johny Gaddar' and 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa' that did quite the opposite. For me this movie rocked big time. And there should be much more movies like this one."

There's a great story here, one brimming with potential. But the movie never fully lives up to the promise of its story. This is certainly not a bad film by any means but it's not a great one either and you get the feeling it should have been.\n\nThe story revolves around Tom Stall, as played by Viggo Mortensen. Tom is a small-town Indiana family man. He owns a local diner, has a beautiful wife (played wonderfully by Maria Bello) and a couple of kids. He leads a very ordinary, mundane kind of life. Then one day there is an attempted robbery at the diner and Tom saves the day, becoming a local celebrity and a very reluctant hero. The national media even picks up on the story...and that is where the problems begin. After Tom's face is splashed across national television someone shows up in this small Indiana town looking to settle an old score with one Tom Stall. Only this man does not believe Tom Stall is actually Tom Stall at all. This gangster, Carl Fogarty (played with an appropriate level of creepiness by Ed Harris), is certain that he knew Tom Stall as Joey back in Philadelphia. Seems Joey removed one of Fogarty's eyes and then disappeared. Suffice to say Fogarty is not real happy about it. As sure as Fogarty is of Tom Stall's true identity, Tom is just as insistent he is who he claims to be, a simple, ordinary, small-town Indiana family man. Where does the truth lie? The heart of the film is in finding out.\n\nSo there's the setup. Quite an intriguing one I must say. Mistaken identity? Hidden identity? Either way, with the presence of an obviously dangerous man like Carl Fogarty looming, there are certain to be some chills and thrills along the way. But the film never really takes off. It kind of limps along, with an occasional spasm of brilliance, but it never really works as well as it should. There are certainly some very good moments, but not enough of them to forgive all the lesser moments. And there are plenty of lesser, some would even say pointless, moments sprinkled throughout. It's a great story and the cast, Harris especially, does a great job with what they are given to work with. But in the end the cast, and ultimately the film, are let down by the material. The story's there, you know there's a great film in that story someplace. But that great film never materializes. It's a good film, but one which leaves you wanting more, with the sense it was one good rewrite away from being truly special.\n\n- hall895\n- Dec 20, 2006\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ5\n\n- Is 'A History of Violence' based on a book?\n- Does Tom suffer from MPD?

Every month, prisoners switch between the tower's many floors and are fed by a vertically moving platform with food on it. The platform is initially filled with lots of food, and gradually descends through the tower's levels, stopping for a fixed amount of time on each floor. Since the residents of each floor tend to eat as much food as they can, those on the lower floors are unable to eat as much food as those at the top, leading to conflict.[5]\n\nThe film's cast includes Iván Massagué, Antonia San Juan, Zorion Eguileor, Emilio Buale Coka and Alexandra Masangkay.[5] It premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), where it won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness.[6] At TIFF, the film also secured a worldwide streaming deal with Netflix.[7] It was released theatrically in Spain on 8 November 2019 by Festival Films. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nGoreng wakes in a cell on level 48. His cellmate Trimagasi explains that they are in a tower-style holding facility. Once per day, food arrives on \"the platform\" that lowers from level 0, stopping for two minutes on each level. Prisoners can only eat while the platform is stopped on their level, and are subjected to fatal temperatures if they keep any food. The lower the level, the less food is left on the platform. Prisoners are randomly reassigned to a new level each month. Trimagasi reveals that when assigned to level 132, he and his former cellmate cannibalized someone. One day, a woman named Miharu rides down the platform. Trimagasi explains that she regularly descends the pit to search for her child. Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the facility in exchange for a diploma, while Trimagasi transferred in serving a year-long sentence.\n\nAfter becoming friends, they are re-shuffled to level 171. Expecting no food, Trimagasi ties up Goreng while the latter sleeps. Trimagasi explains his plans to use Goreng's flesh. Trimagasi eventually begins cutting into Goreng's flesh. Miharu arrives, attacks Trimagasi, and frees Goreng, who kills Trimagasi. Encouraged by Miharu, Goreng eats Trimagasi's flesh and subsequently becomes haunted by hallucinations of Trimagasi.\n\nIn the third month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman named Imoguiri and her dog, Ramesses II. Imoguiri appears to know Goreng. It is revealed that Imoguiri was the administration official who had interviewed Goreng before sending him to the pit, and had volunteered after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri only eats every other day, letting Ramesses II eat on the days that she does not. She tries unsuccessfully to convince the pair below them to also ration their food. One day, Miharu arrives injured, and Goreng and Imoguiri nurse her back to health. Goreng breaks up a fight between Miharu and Imoguiri, to then find out that Miharu had butchered Ramesses II. Miharu leaves soon after, and Goreng mentions her child to Imoguiri, who says there are no children in the pit and Miharu came alone. The following morning they are re-shuffled to level 202, and Goreng wakes to find that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh, plagued with hallucinations of his former cellmates.\n\nIn the fifth month, Goreng is assigned to level 6. His new cellmate, Baharat, attempts to climb to the levels above. The pair above deceives him, making him lose his rope, and almost die. Estimating that there are 250 levels, Goreng convinces Baharat to ride the platform down with him and ration the food. Going down the first 50 levels they do not let anyone get food, arguing that they will get food the next day. They attack and seemingly kill a number of protesters. Fellow prisoner Sr. Brambang recognizes Baharat, and berates him for being too aggressive. He gives them tips on how to conduct themselves on the rest of the way down, and convinces them to send a symbolic message to the administration by leaving a single panna cotta untouched.\n\nAs they descend further, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. They eventually encounter Miharu being attacked and try to save her, but she is killed and they are both left severely injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually stopping at level 333, where Goreng notices a child who turns out to be Miharu's daughter. He gets off the platform with Baharat, only to have it continue downward, leaving them behind and in distress. Goreng tries to convince Baharat to feed the girl the panna cotta. Baharat repeats \"the panna cotta is the message\" over and over, but eventually changes his mind and gives the girl the dessert.\n\nGoreng dreams of Baharat telling him \"the girl is the message\". He awakens to find that Baharat has bled to death. The child and an injured Goreng descend on the platform to the bottom of a dark pit, where he once again hallucinates Trimagasi. Trimagasi tells Goreng that his journey is over, but Goreng explains that he must bear the message. Trimagasi replies that \"the message requires no bearer\". Goreng gets off the platform and the two walk away, watching as the child ascends.\n\n## Cast\n\nCast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Iván Massagué as Goreng\n- Zorion Eguileor as Trimagasi\n- Antonia San Juan as Imoguiri\n- Emilio Buale as Baharat\n- Alexandra Masangkay as Miharu\n- Eric L. Goode as Sr. Brambang\n- Mario Pardo as Baharat's friend\n- Txubio Fernández de Jáuregui as Chef\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was produced by Basque Films alongside Mr. Miyagi Films and Plataforma la película AIE, with the participation of RTVE and ETB and support from ICAA, the Basque administration, and ICO.[8] Shooting lasted for six weeks.[9]\n\nGalder Gaztelu-Urrutia says the film's key message is that \"humanity will have to move towards the fair distribution of wealth\", exploring the importance of individual initiative in driving political change.[10] The screenplay is adapted from a theatre script by David Desola and Pedro Rivero, to which more action and physical elements were added to make it more suitable for a film.[10] \"Extensive\" rewriting was required to convert the unproduced theater script into a screenplay. The director said it was a \"torturous ordeal\", as the writers defended their artistic vision and did not want some of the changes to be made.[11]\n\nThe concrete prison cells were built for the production in a Red Cross facility in a port in Bilbao. The director asked for cells that looked \"economical, robust, [and] impregnable\", which emphasized a sense of architectural and engineering proportion.[10] Only two tiers of concrete cells were built; the appearance of many tiers of cells extending above and below each cell (visible from the hole in the center of each cell) was added in post-production using visual effects.[10] The director says the vertical tower of cells \"represents the dehumanized coldness of the Vertical Self-Management Center\".[11]\n\nThe director states that the film's lavish \"food was treated as another character in the story, one that is aesthetically antagonistic to the architecture of the prison.\"[11] The luxurious displays of gourmet food were presented on \"Versailles worthy tableware\" to depict \"excessive, almost erotic, opulent desire\" that is eventually \"desecrated\" once the near-empty platform reaches the abject, starving inmates on the lower levels.[11]\n\nThe director acknowledges the film can be difficult to watch, but he says the purpose of this approach is to generate discussion and debate by viewers about the political messages.[10] When asked about the film's brutal violence and cannibalism, the director explained that the prison \"is a reflection of our society, [so] it couldn’t hide the violence. It had to show how we rip each other apart.\"[11]\n\nThe film uses two actors cast against type; Iván Massagué and Antonia San Juan, both of whom are known for their comedic roles. The pair were chosen to lighten the film's weighty subject by adding \"humour, irony, and surrealism\".[10] The film was shot chronologically, as the main actor Iván had to lose 12 kg (26 lbs) over the six-week shoot in order to display his character's physical deterioration.[11]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was released in Spain on 8 November 2019 by Festival Films.[1] The Platform was released onto Netflix internationally (including Spain) on 20 March 2020. In July 2020, Netflix revealed the film had been watched by 56 million households over its first four weeks of release, among the high viewing figures ever for one of their original films.[12]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81% based on 97 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"While it may feel muddled at times, The Platform is an inventive and captivating dystopian thriller.\"[13] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[14]\n\nNorman Wilner of Now correctly predicted that the film would win the People's Choice Award, giving it a five-N rating and writing that the film \"has everything: low comedy, political allegory, left-field twists, crowd-pleasing surprises, spectacular violence, sadism, altruism, and yet more spectacular violence, all wrapped up in a high-concept horror film that moves the premise of Cube into a merciless vertical structure. It’s grotesque and compelling, like grindhouse [Luis] Buñuel. And it never blinks.\"[15]\n\nAmy Nicholson of Variety wrote that \"the film’s minimalist fury feels like the plays of Samuel Beckett. Massagué and Eguileor are up to being in a zesty Waiting for Godot. And Eguileor's nasty, delightful, occasionally tender performance feels like an audition to play a Bond villain, or perhaps the Spanish resurrection of Hannibal Lecter.\"[5]\n\nThe film garnered new reviews after a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sam Jones in The Guardian suggested it was \"the perfect parable for life in the time of the coronavirus and a visceral investigation of how a crisis can expose not only the stratification of human society but also the immutable strands of selfishness coded into our DNA.\"[16]\n\n### Accolades\n\n|   Year  | Award                                  | Category                              | Nominee(s)                               | Result    | Ref.     |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n|    2020 | 7th Feroz Awards                       | Best Drama Film                       | Best Drama Film                          | Nominated | [17]     |\n|    2020 | 7th Feroz Awards                       | Best Director                         | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia                   | Nominated | [17]     |\n|    2020 | 7th Feroz Awards                       | Best Screenplay                       | David Desola, Pedro Rivero               | Nominated | [17]     |\n|    2020 | 7th Feroz Awards                       | Best Supporting Actress               | Antonia San Juan                         | Nominated | [17]     |\n|    2020 | 7th Feroz Awards                       | Best Film Poster                      |                                          | Nominated | [17]     |\n|    2020 | 7th Feroz Awards                       | Best Trailer                          |                                          | Nominated | [17]     |\n|    2020 | 12th Gaudí Awards                      | Best Non-Catalan Language Film        | Best Non-Catalan Language Film           | Nominated | [18]     |\n|    2020 | 12th Gaudí Awards                      | Best Screenplay                       | David Desola, Pedro Rivero               | Nominated | [18]     |\n|    2020 | 12th Gaudí Awards                      | Best Visual Effects                   | Mario Campoy, Irene Río, Iñaki Madariaga | Won       | [18]     |\n|    2020 | 75th CEC Medals                        | Best New Director                     | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia                   | Nominated | [19][20] |\n|    2020 | 34th Goya Awards                       | Best Original Screenplay              | David Desola, Pedro Rivero               | Nominated | [21][22] |\n|    2020 | 34th Goya Awards                       | Best New Director                     | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia                   | Nominated | [21][22] |\n|    2020 | 34th Goya Awards                       | Best Special Effects                  | Mario Campoy, Iñaki Madariaga            | Won       | [21][22] |\n|    2020 | 29th Actors and Actresses Union Awards | Best Film Actress in a Secondary Role | Antonia San Juan                         | Nominated | [23][24] |\n|    2020 | 33rd European Film Awards              | Best Visual Effects                   | Iñaki Madariaga                          | Won       | [25]     |\n\n## Sequel\n\nDiscussions around a potential sequel took place after the film's streaming success in 2020.

'The Hole') is a 2019 Spanish dystopian thriller film directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia. The film is set in a large, industrial tower named the \"Vertical Self-Management Center.\" Residents of the tower are imprisoned in the center as punishment for committing crimes. Every month, prisoners switch between the tower's many floors and are fed by a vertically moving platform with food on it. The platform is initially filled with lots of food, and gradually descends through the tower's levels, stopping for a fixed amount of time on each floor. Since the residents of each floor tend to eat as much food as they can, those on the lower floors are unable to eat as much food as those at the top, leading to conflict.\n\nThe film's cast includes Iván Massagué, Antonia San Juan, Zorion Eguileor, Emilio Buale Coka, and Alexandra Masangkay. It premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), where it won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness. At TIFF, the film also secured a worldwide streaming deal with Netflix. It was released theatrically in Spain on November 8, 2019, by Festival Films. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nGoreng wakes in a cell on level 48. His cellmate Trimagasi explains that they are in a tower-style holding facility. Once per day, food arrives on \"the platform\" that lowers from level 0, stopping for two minutes on each level. Prisoners can only eat while the platform is stopped on their level and are subjected to fatal temperatures if they keep any food. The lower the level, the less food is left on the platform. Prisoners are randomly reassigned to a new level each month. Trimagasi reveals that when assigned to level 132, he and his former cellmate cannibalized someone. One day, a woman named Miharu rides down the platform. Trimagasi explains that she regularly descends the pit to search for her child. Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the facility in exchange for a diploma, while Trimagasi transferred in serving a year-long sentence.\n\nAfter becoming friends, they are re-shuffled to level 171. Expecting no food, Trimagasi ties up Goreng while the latter sleeps. Trimagasi explains his plans to use Goreng's flesh. Trimagasi eventually begins cutting into Goreng's flesh. Miharu arrives, attacks Trimagasi, and frees Goreng, who kills Trimagasi. Encouraged by Miharu, Goreng eats Trimagasi's flesh and subsequently becomes haunted by hallucinations of Trimagasi.\n\nIn the third month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman named Imoguiri and her dog, Ramesses II. Imoguiri appears to know Goreng. It is revealed that Imoguiri was the administration official who had interviewed Goreng before sending him to the pit and had volunteered after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri only eats every other day, letting Ramesses II eat on the days that she does not. She tries unsuccessfully to convince the pair below them to also ration their food. One day, Miharu arrives injured, and Goreng and Imoguiri nurse her back to health. Goreng breaks up a fight between Miharu and Imoguiri, to then find out that Miharu had butchered Ramesses II. Miharu leaves soon after, and Goreng mentions her child to Imoguiri, who says there are no children in the pit and Miharu came alone. The following morning they are re-shuffled to level 202, and Goreng wakes to find that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh, plagued with hallucinations of his former cellmates.\n\nIn the fifth month, Goreng is assigned to level 6. His new cellmate, Baharat, attempts to climb to the levels above. The pair above deceives him, making him lose his rope, and almost die. Estimating that there are 250 levels, Goreng convinces Baharat to ride the platform down with him and ration the food. Going down the first 50 levels they do not let anyone get food, arguing that they will get food the next day. They attack and seemingly kill a number of protesters. Fellow prisoner Sr. Brambang recognizes Baharat and berates him for being too aggressive. He gives them tips on how to conduct themselves on the rest of the way down and convinces them to send a symbolic message to the administration by leaving a single panna cotta untouched.\n\nAs they descend further, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. They eventually encounter Miharu being attacked and try to save her, but she is killed and they are both left severely injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually stopping at level 333, where Goreng notices a child who turns out to be Miharu's daughter. He gets off the platform with Baharat, only to have it continue downward, leaving them behind and in distress. Goreng tries to convince Baharat to feed the girl the panna cotta. Baharat repeats \"the panna cotta is the message\" over and over, but eventually changes his mind and gives the girl the dessert.\n\nGoreng dreams of Baharat telling him \"the girl is the message\". He awakens to find that Baharat has bled to death. The child and an injured Goreng descend on the platform to the bottom of a dark pit, where he once again hallucinates Trimagasi. Trimagasi tells Goreng that his journey is over, but Goreng explains that he must bear the message. Trimagasi replies that \"the message requires no bearer\". Goreng gets off the platform and the two walk away, watching as the child ascends.\n\n## Cast\n\nCast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.\n\n- Iván Massagué as Goreng\n- Zorion Eguileor as Trimagasi\n- Antonia San Juan as Imoguiri\n- Emilio Buale as Baharat\n- Alexandra Masangkay as Miharu\n- Eric L. Goode as Sr. Brambang\n- Mario Pardo as Baharat's friend\n- Txubio Fernández de Jáuregui as Chef\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was produced by Basque Films alongside Mr. Miyagi Films and Plataforma la película AIE, with the participation of RTVE and ETB and support from ICAA, the Basque administration, and ICO. Shooting lasted for six weeks.\n\nGalder Gaztelu-Urrutia says the film's key message is that \"humanity will have to move towards the fair distribution of wealth\", exploring the importance of individual initiative in driving political change. The screenplay is adapted from a theatre script by David Desola and Pedro Rivero, to which more action and physical elements were added to make it more suitable for a film. \"Extensive\" rewriting was required to convert the unproduced theater script into a screenplay. The director said it was a \"torturous ordeal\", as the writers defended their artistic vision and did not want some of the changes to be made.\n\nThe concrete prison cells were built for the production in a Red Cross facility in a port in Bilbao. The director asked for cells that looked \"economical, robust, [and] impregnable\", which emphasized a sense of architectural and engineering proportion. Only two tiers of concrete cells were built; the appearance of many tiers of cells extending above and below each cell (visible from the hole in the center of each cell) was added in post-production using visual effects. The director says the vertical tower of cells \"represents the dehumanized coldness of the Vertical Self-Management Center\".\n\nThe director states that the film's lavish \"food was treated as another character in the story, one that is aesthetically antagonistic to the architecture of the prison.\" The luxurious displays of gourmet food were presented on \"Versailles worthy tableware\" to depict \"excessive, almost erotic, opulent desire\" that is eventually \"desecrated\" once the near-empty platform reaches the abject, starving inmates on the lower levels.\n\nThe director acknowledges the film can be difficult to watch, but he says the purpose of this approach is to generate discussion and debate by viewers about the political messages. When asked about the film's brutal violence and cannibalism, the director explained that the prison \"is a reflection of our society, [so] it couldn’t hide the violence. It had to show how we rip each other apart.\"\n\nThe film uses two actors cast against type; Iván Massagué and Antonia San Juan, both of whom are known for their comedic roles. The pair were chosen to lighten the film's weighty subject by adding \"humour, irony, and surrealism\". The film was shot chronologically, as the main actor Iván had to lose 12 kg (26 lbs) over the six-week shoot in order to display his character's physical deterioration.\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was released in Spain on November 8, 2019, by Festival Films. The Platform was released onto Netflix internationally (including Spain) on March 20, 2020. In July 2020, Netflix revealed the film had been watched by 56 million households over its first four weeks of release, among the high viewing figures ever for one of their original films.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81% based on 97 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"While it may feel muddled at times, The Platform is an inventive and captivating dystopian thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".\n\nNorman Wilner of Now correctly predicted that the film would win the People's Choice Award, giving it a five-N rating and writing that the film \"has everything: low comedy, political allegory, left-field twists, crowd-pleasing surprises, spectacular violence, sadism, altruism, and yet more spectacular violence, all wrapped up in a high-concept horror film that moves the premise of Cube into a merciless vertical structure. It’s grotesque and compelling, like grindhouse [Luis] Buñuel. And it never blinks.\"\n\nAmy Nicholson of Variety wrote that \"the film’s minimalist fury feels like the plays of Samuel Beckett. Massagué and Eguileor are up to being in a zesty Waiting for Godot. And Eguileor's nasty, delightful, occasionally tender performance feels like an audition to play a Bond villain, or perhaps the Spanish resurrection of Hannibal Lecter.\"\n\nThe film garnered new reviews after a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sam Jones in The Guardian suggested it was \"the perfect parable for life in the time of the coronavirus and a visceral investigation of how a crisis can expose not only the stratification of human society but also the immutable strands of selfishness coded into our DNA.\"\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Year | Award | Category | Nominee(s) | Result |\n|------|-------|----------|------------|--------|\n| 2020 | 7th Feroz Awards | Best Drama Film | Best Drama Film | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 7th Feroz Awards | Best Director | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 7th Feroz Awards | Best Screenplay | David Desola, Pedro Rivero | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 7th Feroz Awards | Best Supporting Actress | Antonia San Juan | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 7th Feroz Awards | Best Film Poster | | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 7th Feroz Awards | Best Trailer | | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 12th Gaudí Awards | Best Non-Catalan Language Film | Best Non-Catalan Language Film | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 12th Gaudí Awards | Best Screenplay | David Desola, Pedro Rivero | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 12th Gaudí Awards | Best Visual Effects | Mario Campoy, Irene Río, Iñaki Madariaga | Won |\n| 2020 | 75th CEC Medals | Best New Director | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 34th Goya Awards | Best Original Screenplay | David Desola, Pedro Rivero | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 34th Goya Awards | Best New Director | Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 34th Goya Awards | Best Special Effects | Mario Campoy, Iñaki Madariaga | Won |\n| 2020 | 29th Actors and Actresses Union Awards | Best Film Actress in a Secondary Role | Antonia San Juan | Nominated |\n| 2020 | 33rd European Film Awards | Best Visual Effects | Iñaki Madariaga | Won |\n\n## Sequel\n\nDiscussions around a potential sequel took place after the film's streaming success in 2020.

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is a place for fans of various creative works to share theories, interpretations and speculation related to that particular creative work.\n\n# Obvious and not so obvious themes in the movie \"Joker\"\n\nSo I have recently watched the movie and have to admit, found it to be a thought provoking masterpiece to say the least. I believe there are a few important intentional and unintentional themes in the movie that I feel haven't been explored to their depths, and which I will discuss here.\n\n1. \"Hurt people, hurt people\".\n\nThe movie gives us an intimate first person perspective to the experience of someone, who is deemed an outcast and is laughed at, rejected and hurt by the world and people around him. At the beginning of the movie, Arthur really does not seem to present a myriad of negative traits, but rather is a simple aspiring comic who is trying to be a good mama's boy and \"bring everyone joy and happiness\". And its only when betrayed, rejected and hated upon, with nobody seemingly \"believing the tears of a clown\",  he seems to have no choice but to respond back with the same energy. Which really brings to a major theme that I believe is at the core of the movie: Perhaps the villains we as a society view as bad or crazy, are at times simply misunderstood people? And  maybe they are just the product of their environment and circumstances?\n\n2. \"I've realized [my life] isn't a tragedy it's a comedy\".\n\nWhen being scolded by a mom for trying make her son laugh or being accused by his boss about stealing a clown's sign, Arthur is met with pure apprehension and ridicule, which is tragic in a sense, and yet is comical in its essence. It's a tragedy how inhumane we have become as a society, which at times makes it unexplainably funny in some way when looking at it from the objective point of view.\n\n3. \"We are all clowns\"\n\nPhillips has done a tremendous job leaving subtle hints through the movie, and the phrase is definitely one to reflect on. Arthur an aspiring comic and a part time clown, is always forced to put on a happy face and never really talk about what troubles him. Perhaps and just perhaps, we are all wearing a mask in some way and are forced by the society to always \"put on a happy face\" and have become carricutares of our real selves, that have lost their authenticity with no outlet for true expression?\n\n3.5 Connection to: Mass shootings\" phenomena.\n\nI believe the aforementioned theme also greatly ties in and acts as a catalytic to modern day mass shootings phenomena and various atrocities acted by outcasts who just perhaps could never bear \"wearing a mask\" anymore?\n\n4. Violence is \"glorified\" and paid attention to more than kindness\n\nFrom the beginning of the movie, Arthur presents himself as a nice man, vigorously battling with his condition, caring for his mom and simply trying to meet his ends meet by making people laugh, and yet nobody seems to notice it and give him any credit or frankly care about his existence. And it's only after resorting to violence, he seems to get the recognition and glory he feels he deserves. Perhaps as a society, we pay attention to and publicize and care more about violence, rather than kindness?\n\n5. The necessity of self-expression\n\nAnd lastly, I believe the movie also brought up an extremely important theme of self-expression. It is painfully clear that every single time Arthur manages to speak up and express his pain either by finally telling the therapist: \"you never listen to me\" or  or even by committing \"revenge\" crimes on people he thought hurt him, he finally feels liberated and is fully himself and even finds glimpses of happiness in finally letting go of the burden. And the enigmatically artistic hand and body gestures every time he let's go of the \"burden\" are really a symbol of him expressing himself and his pain. It is sadly clear, that the modern society does seem to lack outlets for true self-expression or perhaps even for a caring, listening ear. Any negative emotion is meant to be hidden inside and never let out.\n\nIntentionally or unintentionally, I believe Phillip's has really brought a unique blend to the genre and quite important themes, that cannot be overlooked and here to stay for quite sometime.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of October 13, 2019\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of October 2019\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2019\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

It has a wonderfully clever concept that keeps the film watchable and subversive twists that keep the experience unique.\n\nSadly, what keeps this movie from being powerful and memorable is it's excessive reliance on exposition. So much of it is necessary to explain the overly complex plot and possibly over half of the dialogue is clumsily-written rapid-fire exposition. It just isn't fun.\n\nAnd the script keeps us from forming any sort of emotional connection with this story because it's so concerned with explaining WHAT is happening that it forgets to let us in on the intimacies of WHY it's all happening-who these people are, really, and why we should care.\n\nI find this to be a very frustrating film, because it had so much more potential than was tapped into by this extremely rough screenplay.\n\n- benjaminskylerhill\n- May 11, 2023\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ17\n\n- How long is Hypnotic?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 11, 2023 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - United Kingdom\n    - Canada\n- Official sites\n    - Bluerider Pictures\n    - Official Site\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Spanish\n- Also known as\n    - Hipnosis: Arma Invisible\n- Filming locations\n    - Austin, Texas, USA(Downtown)\n- Production companies\n    - Blue Rider Pictures\n    - Double R Productions (II)\n    - Golden Liberty Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $70,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $4,500,169\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $2,401,686\n    - May 14, 2023\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $16,281,937\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 33 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Hypnotic (2023) in India?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Many of the actors remain the same for both versions, but a few characters (Yadhoom Uncle, Ronnie, and the police officers) are played by different actors.\n\n- ConnectionsReferences Mackenna's Gold (1969)\n\n- SoundtracksIn the Hall of the Mountain King\nWritten by Edvard Grieg\n\n### User reviews328\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Sriram Raghavan delivers a gripping, dark tale of love.\n\nWith Merry Christmas, Sriram Raghavan both satisfies and subverts expectations, crafting another dark comedy thriller flaunting his signature direction style while opting for a more deliberate pace with fewer \"twists\", contrary to the frantic nature of his most recent work - Andhadhun.\n\nMerry Christmas plays out more like a love story than a mystery. The peculiar pairing of Vijay Sethupati and Katrina Kaif was a casting choice bound to be met with skepticism. But the duo deliver mesmerising performances, with Kaif (as Maria) giving one of the finest performances of her long and illustrious career. She perfectly understands the mental torment that Maria is undergoing and depicts it with impeccable elegance. Vijay Sethupati plays Albert, a man on a quest for redemption, perfectly.\n\nSriram Raghavan, once again, is in complete command of his craft, establishing a sense of tension and mystery with the very opening scene. However, he opts for a more methodical pace, which becomes evident as the film unfolds. The major focus of the first half are the character development of the protagonists and the growth of their relationship. While certain phases of the film may seem drawn-out, there is a legitimate purpose for every scene that is included in the film.\n\nRaghavan's use of music is, once again, on point. A plethora of vintage songs are peppered throughout the film, and play out during fitting moments, heightening the impact of the scenes. This is especially demonstrated in the film's final scene, which masterfully uses Vivaldi's \"Winter\" to elevate tension and emotional resonance of the scene.\n\nMerry Christmas is haunting yet fun love story from Sriram Raghavan. It successfully differentiates itself from the director's prior works, while still bearing his distinctive style.\n\n- vinayaksrivastava-20682\n- Mar 21, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ17\n\n- How long is Merry Christmas?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - January 12, 2024 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - India\n- Languages\n    - Hindi\n    - Tamil\n- Production companies\n    - Matchbox Pictures\n    - Tips Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $101,511\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 24 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Merry Christmas (2024)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Night Shyamalan. It stars Bruce Willis as a child psychologist whose patient (Haley Joel Osment) claims he can see and talk to the dead.\n\nReleased by Buena Vista Pictures through its Hollywood Pictures label on August 6, 1999, The Sixth Sense received critical acclaim, with praise for the cast performances (particularly those of Willis, Osment, and Toni Collette), atmosphere, direction and twist ending. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Shyamalan, Best Supporting Actor for Osment, and Best Supporting Actress for Collette.[3] The film established Shyamalan as a preeminent filmmaker of thrillers and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for twist endings.[4]\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $672 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1999 and Shyamalan's highest-grossing film to date.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn Philadelphia, child psychologist Malcolm Crowe is at home with his wife Anna when Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated, breaks into their house. Vincent accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself.\n\nMonths later, Malcolm has begun working with Cole Sear, a nine-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his own failure to help Vincent and to reconcile with Anna, who is suffering from depression. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in it, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Once released, he faints and appears to have been physically assaulted, which his mother attributes to the bullies. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who are unaware that they are dead.\n\nMalcolm believes Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent was supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them.\n\nOne night, Cole finds Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He works out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he gives to her father. The tape reveals that her stepmother poisoned her food, alerting her father to the cause of her death and saving her younger sister.\n\nCole is given a lead part in his school play. He is coached by a ghost director and gives his performance with Malcolm looking on. Before leaving, Cole suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep so he can hear her thoughts and feelings. Cole tells Lynn his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her that his late grandmother visits him and describes details from his mother's childhood that he could not have known. Shocked, Lynn finally believes him.\n\nMalcolm returns home to find his wedding video playing and Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her. Suddenly, she drops his wedding ring, and he notices that he is not wearing it. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see, Malcolm locates his gunshot injury, and he realizes that he did not survive being shot by Vincent. He has been dead the entire time while working with Cole. Malcolm quickly comes to terms with the fact that he is a ghost and apologizes to Anna for haunting her and not letting her move on. He tells her that she was never second to anything and that he loves her. Anna indicates she is now at peace, and Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(left) and , who play the lead roles in the film\n\n- Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe\n- Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear\n- Toni Collette as Lynn Sear\n- Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe\n- Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey\n- Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean\n- Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins\n- Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo\n- Bruce Norris as Mr. Stanley Cunningham\n- Angelica Page as Mrs. Collins\n- Greg Wood as Mr. Collins\n- M. Night Shyamalan as Dr. Hill\n- Peter Tambakis as Darren\n- Jeffrey Zubernis as Bobby\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDavid Vogel, then-president of production of Walt Disney Studios, read Shyamalan's spec script and loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the price of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film.[5] Disney dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and Vogel left the company shortly thereafter.[6] Disney sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office takings.[7]\n\nDuring the casting process for the role of Cole Sear, Shyamalan had been apprehensive about Osment's video audition, saying later he was \"this really sweet cherub, kind of beautiful, blond boy\". Shyamalan saw the role as darker and more brooding but felt that Osment \"nailed it with the vulnerability and the need ... He was able to convey a need as a human being in a way that was amazing to see.\"[8]\n\nWillis was cast in the role of Malcolm Crowe as part of a deal to compensate the studio for Willis's role in the implosion of Broadway Brawler the year before.[9][10]\n\nMarisa Tomei was considered for the role of Lynn Sear.[11]\n\nMichael Cera auditioned for the role of Cole Sear,[12] and Liam Aiken was offered the role but turned it down.[13]\n\n### Filming\n\nSt. Augustine's Church in Philadelphia was used as a filming location\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe color red is absent from most of the film, but it is used prominently in a few isolated shots for \"anything in the real world that has been tainted by the other world\"[14] and \"to connote really explosively emotional moments and situations\".[15] Examples include the door of the church where Cole seeks sanctuary; the balloon, carpet, and Cole's sweater at the birthday party; the tent in which he first encounters Kyra; the volume numbers on Crowe's tape recorder; the doorknob on the locked basement door where Malcolm's office is located; the shirt that Anna wears at the restaurant; Kyra's mother's dress at the wake; and the shawl wrapped around the sleeping Anna.[14]\n\nAll the clothes Malcolm wears are items he wore or touched the evening before his death, including his overcoat, his blue rowing sweatshirt and the different layers of his suit. Though the filmmakers were careful about clues of Malcolm's true state, the camera zooms slowly towards his face when Cole says, \"I see dead people.\" The filmmakers initially feared this would be too much of a giveaway, but left it in.[16]\n\nLocation filming took place mostly in streets and buildings of Philadelphia, including St. Augustine's Church on 4th and New Streets in Old City and on Saint Albans Street in Southwest Center City.[17]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Sixth Sense was released on August 6, 1999, by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Buena Vista handled North American distribution while Spyglass Entertainment handled international sales. Buena Vista International acquired distribution rights in the United Kingdom, Latin America, Australia, and Singapore.[18]\n\n### Home media\n\nAfter a six-month online promotion campaign,[19] The Sixth Sense was released on VHS and DVD by Hollywood Pictures Home Video on March 28, 2000. It went on to become the top-selling DVD of 2000, with more than 2.5 million units shipped, and the all-time second best-selling DVD title up until then, as well as the top video rental title of all-time.[20] The film generated at least $173,320,000 (equivalent to $316,000,000 in 2024) from the US home video market,[21] including $125,850,000 (equivalent to $230,000,000 in 2024) from VHS rentals in the US.[22]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was the third-most-watched film of 2003 on television, with 9 million viewers that year.[23]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Sixth Sense had a production budget of approximately $40 million (plus $25 million for prints and advertising). During its opening weekend, the film grossed $26.6 million, making it the largest August opening weekend, surpassing The Fugitive (1993).[24] It would go on to hold this record for two years until it was overtaken by Rush Hour 2 in 2001.[25] The film spent five weeks as the number 1 film at the U.S. box office, becoming only the second film, after Titanic (1997), to have grossed more than $20 million each for five weekends.[1][26] With a total gross of $29.2 million, The Sixth Sense set the record for having the largest Labor Day weekend gross until 2007 when it was surpassed by Halloween.[27] During Labor Day, it made $6.3 million, making it the biggest September Monday gross, holding that record until it was beaten by It in 2017.[28] It grossed $293,506,292 in the United States and Canada, surpassing The Empire Strikes Back as the tenth highest grossing film of all time in that market at the time.[29] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 57.5 million tickets in the US and Canada.[30]\n\nIn Europe, the film sold 37,124,510 tickets at the box office.[31] In the United Kingdom, it was given at first a limited release on nine screens, and entered at number 8 at the UK box office before climbing up to number one the following week with 430 theatres playing the film.[32][33] It had a record opening in the Netherlands.[34] It had a worldwide gross of $672,806,292, ranking it ninth on the list of worldwide box-office money earners at the time.[29][35]\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand 's performances garnered high critical acclaim and were nominated for  for  and , respectively.\n\nThe Sixth Sense received widespread critical acclaim, with Osment's performance  receiving high praise in particular.[36] On the review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on reviews from 166 critics, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense is a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture, but all the chills of a modern horror flick.\"[37] Metacritic rated it 64 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, meaning \"generally favorable reviews\".[38] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[39]\n\nIn his review for the Los Angeles Times, John Anderson wrote that the script was \"clever\" and called Osment's performance the best of the year from a child actor.[40] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post said the film was a \"maximum creep-out.\"[41]\n\nBy vote of the members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, The Sixth Sense was awarded the Nebula Award for Best Script during 1999.[42] The film was No. 71 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments, for the scene where Cole encounters a female ghost in his tent.[citation needed] In 2024, Looper ranked it number 49 on its list of the \"50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time,\" writing that with the film's success, \"filmmakers and audiences alike began to expect the unexpected, leading to a resurgence of interest in psychological thrillers and supernatural mysteries.\"[43]\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe Sixth Sense has received numerous awards and nominations, with Academy Award nomination categories ranging from those honoring the film itself (Best Picture), to its writing, editing, and direction (Best Director, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay), to its cast's performance (Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress). Especially lauded was the supporting role of actor Haley Joel Osment, whose nominations include an Academy Award,[44] a Golden Globe Award[45] and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.[46]  Overall, The Sixth Sense was nominated for six Academy Awards and four British Academy Film Awards, but won none.[44][47] The film received three nominations from the People's Choice Awards and won all of them, with lead actor Bruce Willis being honored for his role.[48] The Satellite Awards nominated the film in four categories, with awards being received for writing (M.

Vincent accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself. Months later, Malcolm has begun working with Cole Sear, a nine-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his own failure to help Vincent and to reconcile with Anna, who is suffering from depression. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in it, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Once released, he faints and appears to have been physically assaulted, which his mother attributes to the bullies. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who are unaware that they are dead. Malcolm believes Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent was supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them. One night, Cole finds Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He works out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he gives to her father. The tape reveals that her stepmother poisoned her food, alerting her father to the cause of her death and saving her younger sister. Cole is given a lead part in his school play. He is coached by a ghost director and gives his performance with Malcolm looking on. Before leaving, Cole suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep so he can hear her thoughts and feelings. Cole tells Lynn his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her that his late grandmother visits him and describes details from his mother's childhood that he could not have known. Shocked, Lynn finally believes him. Malcolm returns home to find his wedding video playing and Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her. Suddenly, she drops his wedding ring, and he notices that he is not wearing it. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see, Malcolm locates his gunshot injury, and he realizes that he did not survive being shot by Vincent. He has been dead the entire time while working with Cole. Malcolm quickly comes to terms with the fact that he is a ghost and apologizes to Anna for haunting her and not letting her move on. He tells her that she was never second to anything and that he loves her. Anna indicates she is now at peace, and Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.\",\n            \"Cast\": [\n                \"Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe\",\n                \"Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear\",\n                \"Toni Collette as Lynn Sear\",\n                \"Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe\",\n                \"Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey\",\n                \"Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean\",\n                \"Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins\",\n                \"Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo\",\n                \"Bruce Norris as Mr. Stanley Cunningham\",\n                \"Angelica Page as Mrs. Collins\",\n                \"Greg Wood as Mr. Collins\",\n                \"M.

The plot follows a group of college students who retreat to a remote cabin in the woods where they fall victim to a variety of monsters while technicians manipulate events from an underground facility for a global purpose.\n\nGoddard and Whedon, who previously worked together on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, wrote the screenplay in three days,[6]: 13  describing it as an attempt to \"revitalize\" the slasher film genre and as a critical satire on torture porn. The special effects, monster costumes, special makeup, and prosthetic makeup for the film were done by AFX Studio.[7] Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, from March to May 2009 on an estimated budget of $30 million.\n\nThe film was originally slated for release on October 23, 2009, which was later delayed to February 5, 2010,[8] by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and United Artists (UA), but was indefinitely shelved due to financial difficulties. In 2011, Lionsgate picked up the distribution rights. The film premiered in December 2011 at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival in Austin, Texas and was released in the United States on April 13, 2012, to critical and commercial success. It grossed  $66.5 million worldwide, and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its screenplay, tone, and performances.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn an underground laboratory, engineers Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley discuss a mysterious ritual, after a similar operation in Stockholm just ended in failure, leaving only their facility and one in Japan to undertake the process, and with the latter holding a perfect record.\n\nAmerican college students Dana Polk, Jules Louden, Curt Vaughan, Holden McCrea, and Marty Mikalski are spending their weekend at Curt's cousin's cabin in the woods. From the lab, Sitterson and Hadley remotely control the cabin and manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the diary and inadvertently summons the zombified Matthew and Judah Buckner.\n\nHadley releases pheromones to induce Curt and Jules to have sex outside. They are attacked by the Buckners and Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes. Marty discovers concealed surveillance equipment in his room before being stabbed and dragged off by Judah. The lab workers learn that the site in Japan has also failed, meaning that the American rite is \"humanity's last hope\". Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their RV, but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt attempts to jump a ravine on his motorcycle to seek help on the other side, but crashes into a force field and falls to his death. Dana then realizes that their experience is staged and controlled. Holden is killed by Matthew while driving the RV, causing it to crash into the lake. Dana manages to escape, but she is quickly found and brutally attacked by Matthew.\n\nThe lab employees celebrate the success of the rite, believing that Dana is the only survivor. Having previously dismembered Judah, Marty returns and helps Dana escape from Matthew. He takes her to a hidden elevator, and they descend into the lab and discover a large collection of different monsters in cages. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cellar and realizes that the objects determine which monsters are released. Cornered by security personnel, the pair release all the monsters, which wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed by a merman and Dana accidentally stabs Sitterson.\n\nDana and Marty discover an ancient temple, where they are confronted by the facility's director. She explains that worldwide annual rituals of human sacrifice are held to appease the Ancient Ones, a group of cruel subterranean deities. Each region has its own ritual, and the American ritual involves the sacrifice of five archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). The order is arbitrary as long as the whore dies first and the virgin dies last or survives.\n\nThe director urges Dana to kill Marty and complete the ritual, but as Dana considers it, a werewolf suddenly mauls her. Marty shoots the werewolf and scares it off, but the director attacks him. Patience arrives and kills the director before Marty kicks them both into the pit below. Deciding that humanity is not worth saving, Dana and Marty apologize to each other and share a joint as the temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges from the ground, destroying the facility and the cabin.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Kristen Connolly as Dana Polk, a college student designated as \"The Virgin\"\n- Chris Hemsworth as Curt Vaughan, a sociology major  designated as \"The Athlete\"\n- Anna Hutchison as Jules Louden, a pre-medical college student and Curt's girlfriend, designated as \"The Whore\"\n- Fran Kranz as Marty Mikalski, a college student designated as \"The Fool\"\n- Jesse Williams as Holden McCrea, Curt's football teammate, designated as \"The Scholar\"\n- Richard Jenkins as Gary Sitterson, one of the Facility's technicians\n- Bradley Whitford as Steve Hadley, one of the Facility's technicians\n- Brian White as Daniel Truman, the Facility's control room security officer\n- Amy Acker as Wendy Lin, one of the Facility's technicians\n- Sigourney Weaver as The Director, the unnamed leader of the Facility\n- Tim de Zarn as Mordecai, a gas station owner who works for the Facility (designated as \"The Harbinger\")\n- Tom Lenk as Ronald the Intern, the Facility's intern\n- Dan Payne as Mathew Buckner\n- Jodelle Ferland as Patience Buckner\n- Dan Shea as Father Buckner\n\n## Production\n\n### Filming\n\nAn international co-production film between the United States and Canada, principal photography began on March 9, 2009, in Vancouver,[9] and concluded in May 2009. Joss Whedon co-wrote the script with Cloverfield screenwriter Drew Goddard, who also directed the film, marking his directorial debut. Goddard previously worked with Whedon on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel as a writer.\n\nWhedon described the film as an attempt to revitalize the horror genre. He called it a \"loving hate letter\" to the genre, continuing:[10]\n\n... it's a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be all right but at the same time hoping they'll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction.\n\nConcerning the sheer number of creatures to be designed and made for the film, AFX Studio's David LeRoy Anderson estimated that \"close to a thousand\" people were turned into one of around 60 different monster types.[6]: 152  The task necessitated renting a much larger facility to use as a workspace, as a crew of around 60 people were recruited. The producers told them to commence work on December 15, 2008, ahead of the official January 1, 2009, start date. They only completed the work by the March 9, 2009, production date because, as Anderson stated \"We had nearly seventy people at peak, but in effect we had a hundred and forty people, because everybody had at least two jobs...it was crazy, but people had an incredible time...none of us are ever going to forget it, and we're never all going to be in the same room again.\"[6]: 153\n\nThe underground complex, elevators, and the control room were all sets, but for several wide shots, the British Columbia Institute of Technology's Aerospace building was used. Production designer Martin Whist referred to Stanley Kubrick and commented: \"It's very high-tech industrial, and it's a brand new building, never been shot in before...I wanted [the elevators] to be without any controls...to almost feel like a glamorized freight elevator...The lobby I wanted to look slightly utilitarian, contemporary and institutional...sharp and almost characterless.\"[6]: 134–137\n\n### Downloadable content\n\nA tie-in of the film with the video game Left 4 Dead 2 had been planned, with the game seeing downloadable content based on the movie's settings. However, due to MGM's financial problems, the game content was cancelled, but Valve allowed the studio to use monsters from Left 4 Dead 2 to populate the monster cells at the end of the film.[11]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods was slated for wide release on February 5, 2010 (before that, it was slated for release on October 23, 2009),[12][13][14] and then delayed until January 14, 2011, so the film could be converted to 3D.[15][16] However, on June 17, 2010, MGM announced that the film would be delayed indefinitely due to ongoing financial difficulties at the studio.[17][18]\n\nOn March 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"New (MGM) chief executives Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum are seeking to sell both Red Dawn and the horror film The Cabin in the Woods, the last two pictures produced under a previous regime, as they try to reshape the 87-year-old company.\"[19] A distribution sale to Lionsgate was announced on April 28, 2011,[20] with some industry news outlets reporting plans for a Halloween 2011 release.[21]  On July 20, 2011, Lionsgate announced that they had acquired the distribution rights to the film and set a release date of April 13, 2012.[22] Goddard described the deal as \"a dream,\" stating \"there's no question that Lionsgate is the right home for Cabin...you look at all the films that inspired Cabin – most of them were released by Lionsgate in the first place!\"[6]: 40  In an interview with Creative Screenwriting, Goddard focused on the advantages of the delayed release, saying, \"Lionsgate came along and they were the best possible home for that movie. Had the bankruptcy not happened, we wouldn't have been in the right fit with the right people. Yes, it took two years longer than we wish it would've taken, but Lionsgate didn't make us change a frame and believed in what we were trying to do. If I had complained too much when MGM went bankrupt, we could have hurt ourselves. We just held firm that we believed in the movie and that we would find the right home and time, and it did. It's hard, but you have to be very patient in Hollywood.\"[23]\n\nA surprise early screening of the film was held at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon in December 2011, attracting highly positive reactions.[24][25][26] The film later screened on March 9, 2012, at the South by Southwest film festival, also in Austin.[27]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on September 18, 2012.[28] Both the DVD and Blu-ray feature an audio commentary by Goddard and Whedon, several featurettes, a documentary about the making of the film, and a Q&amp;A session at the 2012 WonderCon convention.[29]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods grossed $42.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $24.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $66.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million.[3]\n\nThe film opened in North America on April 13, 2012, opening with $5.5 million and went on to gross $14.7 million in its opening weekend at 2,811 theaters, finishing third at the box office.[30][31] The Cabin in the Woods closed in theaters on July 12, 2012, with $42.0 million. In total earnings, its highest-grossing countries after North America were the United Kingdom ($8.5 million), France ($2.4 million), and Russia ($2.3 million).[32]\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 92%, based on 294 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Cabin in the Woods is an astonishing meta-feat, capable of being funny, strange, and scary—frequently all at the same time.\"[33] On Metacritic, the film achieved an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[34] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.[35]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying that \"The Cabin in the Woods has been constructed almost as a puzzle for horror fans to solve. Which conventions are being toyed with? Which authors and films are being referred to? Is the film itself an act of criticism?\"[36] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \"fiendishly funny\". Travers praised Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz for their performances, and wrote, \"By turning splatter formula on its empty head, Cabin shows you can unleash a fire-breathing horror film without leaving your brain or your heart on the killing floor.\"[37]\n\nCinema Blend's Editor in Chief, Katey Rich, gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote:\n\n\"Even when the story sticks firmly in standard horror territory, this particular group of attractive kids is especially fun to spend time with... You'll have to see it, and you really have to see it if you love horror, hate horror, or have any interest in seeing how the genre can function as a playground for something completely fresh. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are involved, though in roles that are more fun to discover as you go along-- they do get a lot of the best jokes, though, and their scenes show a lot of Goddard's skill in handling the rhythm of a scene.\"[38]\n\nJenkins and Whitford were also admired by The A.V. Club (\"Whitford and Jenkins clearly delight in the verbose script\") and by Wired, whose reviewer (granting 9 of 10 stars) called Cabin \"a smart sendup of horror movies and mythology...with a peculiar relish that testifies to the moviemakers' love of genre film... a smart, sarcastic and deliriously fun journey into the belly of the horror beast.\" He cited the \"witty banter, creative twists\" and \"clippy, quippy dialog that lifted Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to cult status.\"[39]\n\nAnn Hornaday of The Washington Post, giving the movie 3 of 4 stars, wrote:\n\n\"A fiendishly clever brand of meta-level genius propels The Cabin in the Woods, a pulpy, deceivingly insightful send-up of horror movies that elicits just as many knowing chuckles as horrified gasps. [It] comes not only to praise the slasher-, zombie- and gore-fests of yore but to critique them, elaborating on their grammatical elements and archetypal figures even while searching for ways to put them to novel use. The danger in such a loftily ironic approach is that everything in the film appears with ready-made quotation marks around it... But by then, the audience will have picked up on the infectiously goofy vibe of an enterprise that, from its first sprightly moments, clearly has no intention of taking itself too seriously.\"[40]\n\nEric Goldman, writing for IGN, called the movie \"an incredibly clever and fun take on classic horror movie tropes.\"[41] SF Gate said, \"The cliches come at an onslaught pace\" in \"a wonderfully conceived story that gives a bigger than life and fascinating explanation for why so many horror movie cliches exist in the first place... By the time the ride is over, director Drew Goddard and co-writers Goddard and Joss Whedon will change course three or four times, nodding and winking but never losing momentum.\"[42] Of the screenplay by Goddard and Whedon, a CNN reviewer praised \"these horror hipsters' acidic, postmodern designs on one of the movie industry's hoariest, least respected staples... the dialogue is always a notch or three smarter and snappier than you'd expect.\"[43]\n\nKeith Phipps of The A.V. Club addressed \"...the difficult challenge of putting across a satirical film with a serious body count. Cabin touches on everything from the Evil Dead and Friday the 13th to the mechanized mutilations of the Saw series while digging deeper into the Lovecraftian roots of horror in an attempt to reveal what makes the genre work... It's an exercise in metafiction that, while providing grisly fun, never distances viewers. And it's entertaining, while asking the same question of viewers and characters alike: Why come to a place you knew all along was going to be so dark and dangerous?\"[44]\n\nIn a more mixed review, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, calling herself \"a wised-up viewer,\" gave the film a \"B−\" grade and said, \"The movie's biggest surprise may be that the story we think we know from modern scary cinema—that horror is a fun, cosmic game, not much else—here turns out to be pretty much the whole enchilada.\" She shrugged off the talents of Whitford and Jenkins: \"These two experienced actors provide the film's adult-level entertainment.\"[45]\n\nBetsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times believed that the film \"is an inside joke\" and also said, \"The laughs [in the film] come easily, the screams not so much.\"[46] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, \"It's just too bad the movie is never much more than a hollow exercise in self-reflexive cleverness that's not nearly as ingenious as it seems to think.\"[47]\n\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \"Novelty and genre traditionalism often fight to a draw. Too much overt cleverness has a way of spoiling dumb, reliable thrills. And despite the evident ingenuity and strenuous labor that went into it, The Cabin in the Woods does not quite work.\" Scott added:\n\n\"Some of the pleasure of the first (and best) part of The Cabin in the Woods comes from trying to see just over the narrative horizon and figure out what these incompatible sets of clichés have to do with each other. Two distinct kinds of movie are being yoked, by violence, together, and the performers inhabit their familiar roles with unusual wit.\"[48]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award

Peter Gallagher filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in California federal court against the makers of the film.[59] Gallagher claimed that due to the similarities between the film and his 2006 novel The Little White Trip: A Night in the Pines, Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard had used his work without permission. The lawsuit demanded $10 million in damages.[60] Whedon and Goddard were named as defendants, along with the production company Mutant Enemy and distributor Lionsgate.[59][61] The case was dismissed five months later.[62]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The Cabin in the Woods\".

It stars <AdditionalInformation>Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, and Bradley Whitford</AdditionalInformation>. The plot follows a group of college students who retreat to a remote cabin in the woods where they fall victim to a variety of monsters while technicians manipulate events from an underground facility for a global purpose.\n\nGoddard and Whedon, who previously worked together on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, wrote the screenplay in three days, describing it as an attempt to \"revitalize\" the slasher film genre and as a critical satire on torture porn. The special effects, monster costumes, special makeup, and prosthetic makeup for the film were done by AFX Studio. Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, from March to May 2009 on an estimated budget of $30 million.\n\nThe film was originally slated for release on October 23, 2009, which was later delayed to February 5, 2010, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and United Artists (UA), but was indefinitely shelved due to financial difficulties. In 2011, Lionsgate picked up the distribution rights. The film premiered in December 2011 at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival in Austin, Texas and was released in the United States on April 13, 2012, to critical and commercial success. It grossed $66.5 million worldwide, and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its screenplay, tone, and performances.\n\n<Plot>\nIn an underground laboratory, engineers Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley discuss a mysterious ritual, after a similar operation in Stockholm just ended in failure, leaving only their facility and one in Japan to undertake the process, and with the latter holding a perfect record.\n\nAmerican college students Dana Polk, Jules Louden, Curt Vaughan, Holden McCrea, and Marty Mikalski are spending their weekend at Curt's cousin's cabin in the woods. From the lab, Sitterson and Hadley remotely control the cabin and manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the diary and inadvertently summons the zombified Matthew and Judah Buckner.\n\nHadley releases pheromones to induce Curt and Jules to have sex outside. They are attacked by the Buckners and Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes. Marty discovers concealed surveillance equipment in his room before being stabbed and dragged off by Judah. The lab workers learn that the site in Japan has also failed, meaning that the American rite is \"humanity's last hope\". Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their RV, but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt attempts to jump a ravine on his motorcycle to seek help on the other side, but crashes into a force field and falls to his death. Dana then realizes that their experience is staged and controlled. Holden is killed by Matthew while driving the RV, causing it to crash into the lake. Dana manages to escape, but she is quickly found and brutally attacked by Matthew.\n\nThe lab employees celebrate the success of the rite, believing that Dana is the only survivor. Having previously dismembered Judah, Marty returns and helps Dana escape from Matthew. He takes her to a hidden elevator, and they descend into the lab and discover a large collection of different monsters in cages. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cellar and realizes that the objects determine which monsters are released. Cornered by security personnel, the pair release all the monsters, which wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed by a merman and Dana accidentally stabs Sitterson.\n\nDana and Marty discover an ancient temple, where they are confronted by the facility's director. She explains that worldwide annual rituals of human sacrifice are held to appease the Ancient Ones, a group of cruel subterranean deities. Each region has its own ritual, and the American ritual involves the sacrifice of five archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). The order is arbitrary as long as the whore dies first and the virgin dies last or survives.\n\nThe director urges Dana to kill Marty and complete the ritual, but as Dana considers it, a werewolf suddenly mauls her. Marty shoots the werewolf and scares it off, but the director attacks him. Patience arrives and kills the director before Marty kicks them both into the pit below. Deciding that humanity is not worth saving, Dana and Marty apologize to each other and share a joint as the temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges from the ground, destroying the facility and the cabin.\n</Plot>\n\n<Cast>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Kristen Connolly as Dana Polk, a college student designated as \"The Virgin\"</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Chris Hemsworth as Curt Vaughan, a sociology major designated as \"The Athlete\"</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Anna Hutchison as Jules Louden, a pre-medical college student and Curt's girlfriend, designated as \"The Whore\"</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Fran Kranz as Marty Mikalski, a college student designated as \"The Fool\"</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Jesse Williams as Holden McCrea, Curt's football teammate, designated as \"The Scholar\"</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Richard Jenkins as Gary Sitterson, one of the Facility's technicians</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Bradley Whitford as Steve Hadley, one of the Facility's technicians</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Brian White as Daniel Truman, the Facility's control room security officer</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Amy Acker as Wendy Lin, one of the Facility's technicians</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Sigourney Weaver as The Director, the unnamed leader of the Facility</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Tim de Zarn as Mordecai, a gas station owner who works for the Facility (designated as \"The Harbinger\")</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Tom Lenk as Ronald the Intern, the Facility's intern</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Dan Payne as Mathew Buckner</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Jodelle Ferland as Patience Buckner</AdditionalInformation>\n- <AdditionalInformation>Dan Shea as Father Buckner</AdditionalInformation>\n</Cast>\n\n<Production>\n<Filming>\nAn international co-production film between the United States and Canada, principal photography began on March 9, 2009, in Vancouver, and concluded in May 2009. <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> co-wrote the script with Cloverfield screenwriter <Director>Drew Goddard</Director>, who also directed the film, marking his directorial debut. <Director>Goddard</Director> previously worked with <Director>Whedon</Director> on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel as a writer.\n\n<Director>Whedon</Director> described the film as an attempt to revitalize the horror genre. He called it a \"loving hate letter\" to the genre, continuing: \"it's a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be all right but at the same time hoping they'll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction.\"\n\nConcerning the sheer number of creatures to be designed and made for the film, AFX Studio's David LeRoy Anderson estimated that \"close to a thousand\" people were turned into one of around 60 different monster types. The task necessitated renting a much larger facility to use as a workspace, as a crew of around 60 people were recruited. The producers told them to commence work on December 15, 2008, ahead of the official January 1, 2009, start date. They only completed the work by the March 9, 2009, production date because, as Anderson stated \"We had nearly seventy people at peak, but in effect we had a hundred and forty people, because everybody had at least two jobs...it was crazy, but people had an incredible time...none of us are ever going to forget it, and we're never all going to be in the same room again.\"\n</Filming>\n</Production>\n\n<Release>\nThe Cabin in the Woods was slated for wide release on February 5, 2010 (before that, it was slated for release on October 23, 2009), and then delayed until January 14, 2011, so the film could be converted to 3D. However, on June 17, 2010, MGM announced that the film would be delayed indefinitely due to ongoing financial difficulties at the studio.\n\nOn March 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported the following: \"New (MGM) chief executives Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum are seeking to sell both Red Dawn and the horror film The Cabin in the Woods, the last two pictures produced under a previous regime, as they try to reshape the 87-year-old company.\" A distribution sale to Lionsgate was announced on April 28, 2011, with some industry news outlets reporting plans for a Halloween 2011 release. On July 20, 2011, Lionsgate announced that they had acquired the distribution rights to the film and set a release date of April 13, 2012. <Director>Goddard</Director> described the deal as \"a dream,\" stating \"there's no question that Lionsgate is the right home for Cabin...you look at all the films that inspired Cabin – most of them were released by Lionsgate in the first place!\" In an interview with Creative Screenwriting, <Director>Goddard</Director> focused on the advantages of the delayed release, saying, \"Lionsgate came along and they were the best possible home for that movie. Had the bankruptcy not happened, we wouldn't have been in the right fit with the right people. Yes, it took two years longer than we wish it would've taken, but Lionsgate didn't make us change a frame and believed in what we were trying to do. If I had complained too much when MGM went bankrupt, we could have hurt ourselves. We just held firm that we believed in the movie and that we would find the right home and time, and it did. It's hard, but you have to be very patient in Hollywood.\"\n\nA surprise early screening of the film was held at the Butt-Numb-A-Thon in December 2011, attracting highly positive reactions. The film later screened on March 9, 2012, at the South by Southwest film festival, also in Austin.\n</Release>\n\n<HomeMedia>\nThe Cabin in the Woods was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on September 18, 2012. Both the DVD and Blu-ray feature an audio commentary by <Director>Goddard</Director> and <Director>Whedon</Director>, several featurettes, a documentary about the making of the film, and a Q&A session at the 2012 WonderCon convention.\n</HomeMedia>\n\n<Reception>\n<BoxOffice>\nThe Cabin in the Woods grossed $42.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $24.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $66.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nThe film opened in North America on April 13, 2012, opening with $5.5 million and went on to gross $14.7 million in its opening weekend at 2,811 theaters, finishing third at the box office. The Cabin in the Woods closed in theaters on July 12, 2012, with $42.0 million. In total earnings, its highest-grossing countries after North America were the United Kingdom ($8.5 million), France ($2.4 million), and Russia ($2.3 million.\n</BoxOffice>\n\n<CriticalResponse>\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 92%, based on 294 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Cabin in the Woods is an astonishing meta-feat, capable of being funny, strange, and scary—frequently all at the same time.\" On Metacritic, the film achieved an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying that \"The Cabin in the Woods has been constructed almost as a puzzle for horror fans to solve. Which conventions are being toyed with? Which authors and films are being referred to? Is the film itself an act of criticism?\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \"fiendishly funny\". Travers praised Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz for their performances, and wrote, \"By turning splatter formula on its empty head, Cabin shows you can unleash a fire-breathing horror film without leaving your brain or your heart on the killing floor.\"\n\nCinema Blend's Editor in Chief, Katey Rich, gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Even when the story sticks firmly in standard horror territory, this particular group of attractive kids is especially fun to spend time with... You'll have to see it, and you really have to see it if you love horror, hate horror, or have any interest in seeing how the genre can function as a playground for something completely fresh. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are involved, though in roles that are more fun to discover as you go along-- they do get a lot of the best jokes, though, and their scenes show a lot of <Director>Goddard</Director>'s skill in handling the rhythm of a scene.\"\n\nJenkins and Whitford were also admired by The A.V. Club (\"Whitford and Jenkins clearly delight in the verbose script\") and by Wired, whose reviewer (granting 9 of 10 stars) called Cabin \"a smart sendup of horror movies and mythology...with a peculiar relish that testifies to the moviemakers' love of genre film... a smart, sarcastic and deliriously fun journey into the belly of the horror beast.\" He cited the \"witty banter, creative twists\" and \"clippy, quippy dialog that lifted Firefly and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to cult status.\"\n\nAnn Hornaday of The Washington Post, giving the movie 3 of 4 stars, wrote: \"A fiendishly clever brand of meta-level genius propels The Cabin in the Woods, a pulpy, deceivingly insightful send-up of horror movies that elicits just as many knowing chuckles as horrified gasps. [It] comes not only to praise the slasher-, zombie- and gore-fests of yore but to critique them, elaborating on their grammatical elements and archetypal figures even while searching for ways to put them to novel use. The danger in such a loftily ironic approach is that everything in the film appears with ready-made quotation marks around it... But by then, the audience will have picked up on the infectiously goofy vibe of an enterprise that, from its first sprightly moments, clearly has no intention of taking itself too seriously.\"\n\nEric Goldman, writing for IGN, called the movie \"an incredibly clever and fun take on classic horror movie tropes.\" SF Gate said, \"The cliches come at an onslaught pace\" in \"a wonderfully conceived story that gives a bigger than life and fascinating explanation for why so many horror movie cliches exist in the first place... By the time the ride is over, director <Director>Goddard</Director> and co-writers <Director>Goddard</Director> and <Director>Whedon</Director> will change course three or four times, nodding and winking but never losing momentum.\" Of the screenplay by <Director>Goddard</Director> and <Director>Whedon</Director>, a CNN reviewer praised \"these horror hipsters' acidic, postmodern designs on one of the movie industry's hoariest, least respected staples... the dialogue is always a notch or three smarter and snappier than you'd expect.\"\n\nKeith Phipps of The A.V. Club addressed \"...the difficult challenge of putting across a satirical film with a serious body count. Cabin touches on everything from the Evil Dead and Friday the 13th to the mechanized mutilations of the Saw series while digging deeper into the Lovecraftian roots of horror in an attempt to reveal what makes the genre work... It's an exercise in metafiction that, while providing grisly fun, never distances viewers. And it's entertaining, while asking the same question of viewers and characters alike: Why come to a place you knew all along was going to be so dark and dangerous?\"\n\nIn a more mixed review, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, calling herself \"a wised-up viewer,\" gave the film a \"B−\" grade and said, \"The movie's biggest surprise may be that the story we think we know from modern scary cinema—that horror is a fun, cosmic game, not much else—here turns out to be pretty much the whole enchilada.\" She shrugged off the talents of Whitford and Jenkins: \"These two experienced actors provide the film's adult-level entertainment.\"\n\nBetsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times believed that the film \"is an inside joke\" and also said, \"The laughs [in the film] come easily, the screams not so much.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, \"It's just too bad the movie is never much more than a hollow exercise in self-reflexive cleverness that's not nearly as ingenious as it seems to think.\" \n\nA. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \"Novelty and genre traditionalism often fight to a draw. Too much overt cleverness has a way of spoiling dumb, reliable thrills. And despite the evident ingenuity and strenuous labor that went into it, The Cabin in the Woods does not quite work.\" Scott added: \"Some of the pleasure of the first (and best) part of The Cabin in the Woods comes from trying to see just over the narrative horizon and figure out what these incompatible sets of clichés have to do with each other. Two distinct kinds of movie are being yoked, by violence, together, and the performers inhabit their familiar roles with unusual wit.\"\n</CriticalResponse>\n\n<Accolades>\n| Award | Date of ceremony | Category | Nominee(s) | Result |\n|-------|------------------|----------|------------|--------|\n| Bram Stoker Award | June 2013 | Best Screenplay | <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> and <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> | Won |\n| British Fantasy Award | November 3, 2013 | Best Screenplay | <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> | Won |\n| Central Ohio Film Critics Association | January 3, 2013 | Best Original Screenplay | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> | Runner-up |\n| Central Ohio Film Critics Association | January 3, 2013 | Best Picture | Best Picture | 5th place |\n| Chicago Film Critics Association | December 17, 2012 | Most Promising Filmmaker | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> | Nominated |\n| Detroit Film Critics Society | December 14, 2012 | Best Screenplay | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> | Nominated |\n| Empire Awards | March 24, 2013 | Best Horror | Best Horror | Nominated |\n| Fangoria Chainsaw Award | June 13, 2013 | Best Screenplay | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> | Won |\n| Fangoria Chainsaw Award | June 13, 2013 | Best Supporting Actor | Fran Kranz | Won |\n| Fangoria Chainsaw Award | June 13, 2013 | Best Wide-Release Film | Best Wide-Release Film | Won |\n| Fangoria Chainsaw Award | June 13, 2013 | Best Makeup/Creature FX | David LeRoy Anderson | Won |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | May 31, 2012 | Best Horror TV Spot | Best Horror TV Spot | Won |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | May 31, 2012 | Best Standee for Feature Film | Best Standee for Feature Film | Nominated |\n| Hugo Award | September 1, 2013 | Best Dramatic Presentation – Long Form | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> | Nominated |\n| Kansas City Film Critics Circle | December 16, 2012 | Best Science Fiction, Fantasy or Horror Film | Best Science Fiction, Fantasy or Horror Film | Won |\n| Motion Picture Sound Editors | February 17, 2013 | Best Sound Editing – Music in a Feature Film | Clint Bennett (supervising music editor) Tony Lewis (music editor) Julie Pearce (music editor) | Nominated |\n| Online Film Critics Society | December 24, 2012 | Best Original Screenplay | <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> | Nominated |\n| Phoenix Film Critics Society | December 18, 2012 | Overlooked Film of the Year | Overlooked Film of the Year | Nominated |\n| San Diego Film Critics Society | December 11, 2012 | Best Original Screenplay | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> | Nominated |\n| Saturn Awards | June 26, 2013 | Best Horror or Thriller Film | Best Horror or Thriller Film | Won |\n| Saturn Awards | June 26, 2013 | Best Writing | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> <Director>Joss Whedon</Director> | Nominated |\n| Toronto Film Critics Association | December 18, 2012 | Best First Feature | <Director>Drew Goddard</Director> | Nominated |\n</Accolades>\n\n<Lawsuit>\nOn April 13, 2015, author Peter Gallagher filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in California federal court against the makers of the film.

Set in a morally decaying New York City following the Vietnam War, it stars Robert De Niro as veteran Marine and taxi driver Travis Bickle, whose mental state deteriorates as he works nights in the city. The film also stars Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, and Albert Brooks in his first film role.\n\nWith The Wrong Man (1956) and A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspiration, Scorsese wanted the film to feel like a dream to audiences.[citation needed] Filming began in the summer of 1975 in New York City, with actors taking pay cuts to ensure that the project could be completed on a low budget of $1.9 million. Production concluded that same year. Bernard Herrmann composed for the film what would be his final score; the music was finished just hours before his death, and the film is dedicated to him.\n\nTheatrically released by Columbia Pictures on February 8, 1976, the film was critically and commercially successful despite generating controversy both for its graphic violence in the climactic ending and for the casting of then 12-year-old Foster as a child prostitute. The film received numerous accolades including the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival and four nominations at the 49th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (for De Niro), and Best Supporting Actress (for Foster).\n\nAlthough Taxi Driver generated further controversy for inspiring John Hinckley Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the film has remained popular. It is considered one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most culturally significant and inspirational of its time, garnering cult status.[8] In 2022, Sight &amp; Sound named it the 29th-best film ever in its decennial critics' poll, and the 12th-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll, tied with Barry Lyndon. In 1994, the film was considered \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically\" significant by the U.S. Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn New York City, Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequenting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary in which he consciously attempts to include aphorisms such as \"you're only as healthy as you feel.\" He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses in the city and dreams about getting \"the scum off the streets.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Travis enters the campaign office where she works and asks her out for coffee, to which she agrees. Betsy agrees to go on another date with him. During their date, Travis takes Betsy to a porn theater, which she leaves. He attempts to reconcile with her, but fails. Enraged, he storms into the campaign office where she works and proceeds to berate her before being kicked out of the office.\n\nExperiencing an existential crisis and seeing various acts of prostitution throughout the city, Travis confides in a fellow taxi driver nicknamed Wizard about his violent thoughts. However, Wizard dismisses them and assures him that he will be fine. To find an outlet for his rage, Travis follows an intense physical training regimen. He gets in contact with black market gun dealer Easy Andy, and buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices drawing his weapons, even creating a quick-draw rig hidden in his sleeve. He begins attending Palantine's rallies to scope out his security. One night, Travis shoots and kills a man attempting to rob a convenience store run by a friend of his.\n\nOn his trips around the city, Travis regularly encounters Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute. Tricking her pimp and abusive lover, Sport, into thinking he wants to solicit her, Travis meets with her in private and tries to persuade her to stop prostituting herself. Soon after, Travis shaves his hair into a mohawk and attends a public rally where he plans to assassinate Palantine. However, Secret Service agents see Travis putting his hand inside his jacket and approach him, escalating into a chase. Travis escapes pursuit and makes it home undetected.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to the brothel where Iris works to kill Sport. He enters the building and shoots Sport and one of Iris's clients, a mafioso. Travis is shot several times, but manages to kill the two men. He then fights with the bouncer, who he manages to stab through the hand with his knife and kill with a gunshot to the head. Travis attempts to commit suicide, but is out of bullets. Severely injured, he slumps on a couch next to a sobbing Iris. As police respond to the scene, Travis imitates shooting himself in the head using his finger.\n\nTravis goes into a coma due to his injuries. He is heralded by the press as a heroic vigilante and not prosecuted for the murders. He receives a letter from Iris's parents in Pittsburgh, who thank him and reveal that she is safe and attending school back home.\n\nAfter recovering, Travis grows his hair out and returns to work, where he encounters Betsy as a fare; they interact, with Betsy saying she followed his story in the newspapers. Travis drops her at home, and declines to take her money, driving off with a smile. He suddenly becomes agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror, but continues driving into the night.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle\n- Jodie Foster as Iris Steensma\n- Cybill Shepherd as Betsy\n- Harvey Keitel as Matthew \"Sport\" Higgins\n- Albert Brooks as Tom\n- Leonard Harris as Senator Charles Palantine\n- Peter Boyle as \"Wizard\"\n- Steven Prince as \"Easy Andy\", the Gun Salesman\n- Martin Scorsese as \"Passenger Watching Silhouette\"/Man Outside Palantine Headquarters\n- Harry Northup as \"Doughboy\"\n- Victor Argo as Melio, the Bodega Clerk\n- Joe Spinell as The Personnel Officer\n\n[1][9]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nMartin Scorsese has stated that it was Brian De Palma who introduced him to Paul Schrader,[10] and Taxi Driver arose from Scorsese's feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to evoke within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. Scorsese cites Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man (1956) and Jack Hazan's A Bigger Splash (1973) as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.[11] Before Scorsese was hired, John Milius and Irvin Kershner were considered to helm the project.[12] In writing the script, Schrader drew inspiration from the diaries of Arthur Bremer, who shot presidential candidate George Wallace in 1972,[13] as well as from the Harry Chapin song \"Taxi\", which is about an old girlfriend getting into a cab.[14] For the ending of the story, in which Bickle becomes a media hero, Schrader was inspired by Sara Jane Moore's attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford, which resulted in her being on the cover of Newsweek.[15]\n\nSchrader also used himself as inspiration. In a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on The Tomorrow Show, he related his experience of living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a stomach ulcer, Schrader wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver in \"under a fortnight.\" He states, \"The first draft was maybe 60 pages, and I started the next draft immediately, and it took less than two weeks.\" Schrader recalls, \"I realized I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks [...] that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating around the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the national trauma of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.[16] Two drafts were written in ten days.[17] Pickpocket, a film by the French director Robert Bresson, was also cited as an influence.[18]\n\nIn Scorsese on Scorsese, Scorsese mentions the religious symbolism in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the samurai's \"death with honor\" principle.[11] Dustin Hoffman was offered the role of Travis Bickle but turned it down because he thought that Scorsese was \"crazy\".[19] Al Pacino and Jeff Bridges were also considered for Travis Bickle.[12]\n\n### Pre-production\n\nWhile preparing for his role as Bickle, De Niro was filming Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 in Italy. According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break, would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks before returning to Rome to resume filming 1900. Although Robert DeNiro had already starred in Godfather II (1974), he was only recognized one time while driving a cab in New York City.[20] De Niro apparently lost 16 kilograms (35 pounds) and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of criminal Arthur Bremer. When he had time off from shooting 1900, De Niro visited an army base in Northern Italy and tape-recorded soldiers from the Midwestern United States, whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.[21]\n\nScorsese brought in the film title designer Dan Perri to design the title sequence for Taxi Driver. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in 1974, but Warner Bros would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time Taxi Driver was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on The Exorcist, and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for Taxi Driver using second unit footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and slit-scan, resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing neon signs, distorted nocturnal images, and deep black levels. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this, including Star Wars (1977) and Raging Bull (1980).[22][23]\n\n### Filming\n\nColumbia Pictures gave Scorsese a budget of $1.3 million in April 1974.[10] On a budget of only $1.9 million, various actors took pay cuts to bring the project to life. De Niro and Cybill Shepherd received only $35,000 to make the film, while Scorsese was given $65,000. Overall, $200,000 of the budget was allocated to performers in the movie.[3][24]\n\nTaxi Driver was shot during a New York City summer heat wave and sanitation strike in 1975. The film ran into conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) due to its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the colors in the final shootout, which allowed the film to get an R rating. To capture the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound technicians would get in the trunk while Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman later admitted the filming style was heavily influenced by New Wave filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard and his cinematographer Raoul Coutard, as the crew did not have the time or money to do \"traditional things\".[25] When Bickle decides to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a mohawk. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted that Magnotta told them that, \"in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved—like a little Mohawk—that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them. They were ready to kill.\"[13]\n\nFilming took place on New York City's West Side, at a time when the city was on the brink of bankruptcy. According to producer Michael Phillips, \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets [...] we didn't know we were documenting what looked like the dying gasp of New York.\"[26] The tracking shot over the shootout scene, filmed in an actual apartment, took three months of preparation; the production team had to cut through the ceiling to shoot it.[27]\n\n## Music\n\n| Taxi Driver: Original Soundtrack Recording   | Taxi Driver: Original Soundtrack Recording   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Soundtrack album by Bernard Herrmann         | Soundtrack album by Bernard Herrmann         |\n| Released                                     | May 19, 1998                                 |\n| Recorded                                     | December 22 and 23, 1975[28]                 |\n| Genre                                        | Soundtrack                                   |\n| Length                                       | 61:33                                        |\n| Label                                        | Arista                                       |\n| Producer                                     | Michael Phillips, Neely Plumb                |\n\n| Review scores   | Review scores   |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Source          | Rating          |\n| AllMusic        | [29]            |\n\nBernard Herrmann previously scored De Palma's Obsession and De Palma introduced Herrmann to Scorsese.[30] The music by Herrmann was his final score before his death on December 24, 1975, several hours after Herrmann completed the recording for the soundtrack, and the film is dedicated to his memory. Scorsese, a long-time admirer of Herrmann, had particularly wanted him to compose the score; Herrmann was his \"first and only choice\". Scorsese considered Herrmann's score of great importance to the success of the film: \"It supplied the psychological basis throughout.\"[31] The album The Silver Tongued Devil and I from Kris Kristofferson was used in the film, following Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) where Kristofferson played a supporting role.[32] Jackson Browne's \"Late for the Sky\" is also featured.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Casting of Jodie Foster\n\nSome critics showed concern over 12-year-old Foster's presence during the climactic shoot-out.[33] Foster said that she was present during the setup and staging of the special effects used during the scene; the entire process was explained and demonstrated for her, step by step. Moreover, Foster said, she was fascinated and entertained by the behind-the-scenes preparation that went into the scene. In addition, before being given the part, Foster was subjected to psychological testing, attending sessions with a UCLA psychiatrist, to ensure that she would not be emotionally scarred by her role, in accordance with California Labor Board requirements monitoring children's welfare on film sets.[34][35]\n\nAdditional concerns surrounding Foster's age focus on the role she played as Iris, a prostitute. Years later, she confessed how uncomfortable the treatment of her character was on set. Scorsese did not know how to approach different scenes with the actress. The director relied on Robert De Niro to deliver his directions to the young actress. Foster often expressed how De Niro, in that moment, became a mentor to her, stating that her acting career was highly influenced by the actor's advice during the filming of Taxi Driver.[36]\n\n### John Hinckley Jr.\n\nTaxi Driver formed part of the delusional fantasy of John Hinckley Jr.[37] that triggered his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981, an act for which he was found not guilty by reason of insanity.[38] Hinckley stated that his actions were an attempt to impress Foster, on whom Hinckley was fixated, by mimicking Travis's mohawked appearance at the Palantine rally. His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.[39][40] When Scorsese heard about Hinckley's motivation behind his assassination attempt, he briefly thought about quitting film-making as the association brought a negative perception of the film.[41]\n\n### MPAA rating\n\nThe climactic shoot-out was considered intensely graphic by some critics, who even considered giving the film an X rating.[42] The film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival for its graphic violence.[43] To obtain an R rating, Scorsese had the colors desaturated, making the brightly colored blood less prominent. In later interviews, Scorsese commented that he was pleased by the color change and considered it an improvement over the original scene.[44] However, in the special-edition DVD, Michael Chapman, the film's cinematographer, expresses regret about the decision and the fact that no print with the unmuted colors exists anymore, as the originals had long since deteriorated.\n\n## Themes and interpretations\n\nRoger Ebert has written of the film's ending:\n\nThere has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's \"heroism\" of saving Iris, and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters. They despise themselves, they live in sin, they occupy mean streets, but they want to be forgiven and admired.[45]\n\nJames Berardinelli, in his review of the film, argues against the dream or fantasy interpretation, stating:\n\nScorsese and writer Paul Schrader append the perfect conclusion to Taxi Driver. Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores the vagaries of fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, he would have been reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl.[46]\n\nIn the 1990 LaserDisc audio commentary (included on the [DVD] and Blu-ray), Scorsese acknowledged several critics' interpretation of the film's ending as Bickle's dying dream. He admits that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that Bickle will fall into rage and recklessness in the future and that he is like \"a ticking time bomb\".[47] Writer Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th-anniversary DVD, stating that Travis \"is not cured by the movie's end,\" and that \"he's not going to be a hero next time.\"[48] When asked on the website Reddit about the film's ending, Schrader said that it was not to be taken as a dream sequence but that he envisioned it as returning to the beginning of the film, as if the last frame \"could be spliced to the first frame, and the movie started all over again.\"[49]\n\nThe film has also been associated with the 1970s wave of vigilante films, but it has also been set apart from them as a more reputable New Hollywood film. While it shares similarities with those films,[50] it is not explicitly a vigilante film and does not belong to that particular wave of cinema.[51]\n\nThe film can be seen as a spiritual successor to The Searchers, according to Roger Ebert. Both films focus on a solitary war veteran who tries to save a young girl who is resistant to his efforts. The main characters in both movies are portrayed as being disconnected from society and incapable of forming normal relationships with others. Although it is unclear whether Paul Schrader sought inspiration from The Searchers specifically, the similarities between the two films are evident.[52]\n\nThe film has been labeled as \"neo-noir\" by some critics,[53][54] while others have referred to it as an antihero film.[55][56] When shown on television, the ending credits featured a black screen with a disclaimer mentioning that \"the distinction between hero and villain is sometimes a matter of interpretation or misinterpretation of facts.\" This disclaimer was thought to have been added after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981, but in fact, it had been mentioned in a review of the film as early as 1979. LA Weekly, Letterboxd, and Yardbarker list this movie as belonging to the vetsploitation subgenre.[57][58][59]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film opened at the Coronet Theater in New York City and grossed a house record of $68,000 in its first week.[60] It went on to gross $28.3 million in the United States,[61] making it the 17th-highest-grossing film of 1976.\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performances of  and  garnered universal critical acclaim, earning them  nominations for  and  respectively.\n\nTaxi Driver received universal critical acclaim. Roger Ebert instantly praised it as one of the greatest films he had ever seen, claiming:\n\nTaxi Driver is a hell, from the opening shot of a cab emerging from stygian clouds of steam to the climactic killing scene in which the camera finally looks straight down. Scorsese wanted to look away from Travis's rejection; we almost want to look away from his life. But he's there, all right, and he's suffering.[62]\n\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 158 reviews and an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best.\"[63] Metacritic gives the film a score of 94 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[64]\n\nTaxi Driver was ranked by the American Film Institute as the 52nd-greatest American film on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list, and Bickle was voted the 30th-greatest villain in a poll by the same organization. The Village Voice ranked Taxi Driver at number 33 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.[65] Empire also ranked him 18th in its \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll,[66] and the film ranks at No. 17 on the magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.[67]\n\nTime Out magazine conducted a poll of the 100 greatest movies set in New York City. Taxi Driver topped the list, placing at No. 1.[68] Schrader's screenplay for the film was ranked the 43rd-greatest ever written by the Writers Guild of America.[69] Taxi Driver was also ranked as the 44th best-directed film of all time by the Directors Guild of America.[70] In contrast, Leonard Maltin gave a rating of only 2 stars and called it a \"gory, cold-blooded story of a sick man's lurid descent into violence\" that was \"ugly and unredeeming\".[71]\n\nIn 2012, in a Sight &amp; Sound poll, Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi selected Taxi Driver as one of his 10 best films of all time.[72] Quentin Tarantino also listed the movie among his 10 greatest films of all time.[73]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                       | Category

Driver ranked 19th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.[90]\n\n## Legacy\n\nTaxi Driver, American Gigolo, Light Sleeper, and The Walker make up a series referred to variously as the \"Man in a Room\" or \"Night Worker\" films. Screenwriter Paul Schrader (who directed the latter three films) has said that he considers the central characters of the four films to be one character, who has changed as he has aged.[91][92] The film also influenced the Charles Winkler film You Talkin' to Me?[93]\n\nAlthough Meryl Streep had not aspired to become a film actor, De Niro's performance in Taxi Driver had a profound impact on her; she said to herself, \"That's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up.\"[94]\n\nThe 1994 portrayal of psychopath Albie Kinsella by Robert Carlyle in British television series Cracker was in part inspired by Travis Bickle, and Carlyle's performance has frequently been compared to De Niro's as a result.[95][96]\n\nIn the 2012 film Seven Psychopaths, psychotic Los Angeles actor Billy Bickle (Sam Rockwell) believes himself to be the illegitimate son of Travis Bickle.[97]\n\nThe vigilante ending inspired Jacques Audiard for his 2015 Palme d'Or-winning film Dheepan. The French director based the eponymous Tamil Tiger character on the one played by Robert De Niro in order to make him a \"real movie hero\".[98] The script of Joker by Todd Phillips also draws inspiration from Taxi Driver.[99][100][101]\n\n### \"You talkin' to me?\"\n\nDe Niro's \"You talkin' to me?\" speech has become a pop culture mainstay. In 2005, it was ranked number 10 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.\n\nIn the relevant scene, the deranged Bickle is looking into a mirror at himself, imagining a confrontation that would give him a chance to draw his gun:\n\nYou talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Then who the hell else are you talkin' to? You talkin' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?\n\nWhile Scorsese said that he drew inspiration from John Huston's 1967 movie Reflections in a Golden Eye in a scene in which Marlon Brando's character is facing the mirror,[102] screenwriter Paul Schrader said De Niro improvised the dialogue and that De Niro's performance was inspired by \"an underground New York comedian\" he had once seen, possibly including his signature line.[103] Roger Ebert said of the latter part of the phrase \"I'm the only one here\" that it was \"the truest line in the film.... Travis Bickle's desperate need to make some kind of contact somehow—to share or mimic the effortless social interaction he sees all around him, but does not participate in.\"[104] In his 2009 memoir, saxophonist Clarence Clemons said that De Niro explained the line's origins during production of New York, New York (1977), with the actor seeing Bruce Springsteen say the line onstage at a concert.[105] In the 2000 film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, De Niro went on to repeat the monologue with some alterations in the role of the character Fearless Leader.[106]\n\n## Home media\n\nThe first Collector's Edition DVD, which was released in 1999, was packaged as a single-disc edition. It contained special features such as behind-the-scenes footage and several trailers, including one for Taxi Driver.\n\nIn 2006, a 30th-anniversary two-disc \"Collector's Edition\" DVD was released. The first disc contains the film itself, two audio commentaries (one by writer Schrader and the other by Professor Robert Kolker), and trailers. This edition also includes some of the special features from the earlier release on the second disc, as well as some newly produced documentary material.[107][108]\n\nTo commemorate the film's 35th anniversary, a Blu-ray was released on April 5, 2011. It includes the special features from the previous two-disc collector's edition, plus an audio commentary by Scorsese that was released in 1991 for the Criterion Collection, which was previously released on LaserDisc.[109]\n\nAs part of the Blu-ray production, Sony gave the film a full 4K digital restoration, which included scanning and cleaning the original negative (removing emulsion dirt and scratches). Colors were matched to director-approved prints under guidance from Scorsese and director of photography Michael Chapman. An all-new lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack was also created from the original stereo recordings by Scorsese's personal sound team.[110][111] The restored print premiered in February 2011 at the Berlin Film Festival. To promote the Blu-ray, Sony also had the print screened at AMC Theatres across the United States on March 19 and 22.[112][113][114]\n\n## Possible sequel and remake\n\nIn late January 2005, De Niro and Scorsese announced a sequel.[115] At a 25th-anniversary screening of Raging Bull, De Niro talked about the development of a story featuring an older Travis Bickle. In 2000, De Niro expressed interest in bringing back the character in a conversation with Actors Studio host James Lipton.[116] In November 2013, he revealed that Schrader had written a first draft, but both he and Scorsese thought it was not good enough to proceed.[117]\n\nSchrader disputed this in a 2024 interview, saying, \"Robert is the one who wanted to do that. He asked Marty and I. [...] So he pressed Marty on it and Marty asked me and I said, 'Marty, that’s the worst fucking idea I’ve ever heard.' He said, 'Yeah, but you tell him. Let’s have dinner.' So we had dinner at Bob’s restaurant and Bob was talking about it. I said, 'Wow, that’s the worst fucking idea I’ve ever heard. That character dies at the end of that movie or dies shortly thereafter. He’s gone. Oh, but maybe there is a version of him that I could do. Maybe he became Ted Kaczynski and maybe he’s in a cabin somewhere and just sitting there, making letter bombs. Now, that would be cool. That would be a nice Travis. He doesn’t have a cab anymore. He just sits there [Laughs] making letter bombs.' But Bob didn’t cotton to that idea, either.\"[118]\n\nIn 2010, Variety reported rumors that Lars von Trier, Scorsese, and De Niro planned to work on a remake of the film with the same restrictions used in The Five Obstructions.[119] However, in 2014, Paul Schrader said that the remake was not being made. He commented, \"It was a terrible idea\" and \"in Marty's mind, it never was something that should be done.\"[120]\n\n## See also\n\n- Martin Scorsese filmography\n- 1976 in film\n- List of cult films\n- List of films featuring psychopaths and sociopaths\n- List of films set in New York City\n- Crime in New York City\n- History of the United States (1964–1980)\n    - History of New York City (1946–1977)\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Posthumous nomination.\n- ^ a b Posthumous award.\n- ^ Posthumous nomination\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"AFI|Catalog - Taxi Driver\". catalog.afi.com.

I loved the movies originality, atmosphere, and complexity. All of the characters were interesting and I cared about them. Particularly the acting from Jake Gyllenhaal was truly amazing.\n\nThe reason why I’m making this post is to examine the message and themes of Donnie Darko. Because the plot in itself is so complicated, I feel people are too focused unraveling that to really talk about the actual themes and message of the film. Usually, looking up the analysis of a film would reveal its message and meaning. But doing that with this film only lead me to websites talking about the time travel aspect of the movie. This is my first watch of my film, so I think I still need to pick up on a lot. What I saw was a theme of isolation and selflessness.\n\nDonnie starts out as an isolated, resentful kid who’s cold towards his family - even calling his mother a bitch solely because she calmly corrected him for rude behavior. He also discusses with his therapist about dying alone, saying he fears it but also feels it’s unavoidable. I found this interesting as Donnie is quite clearly the cause of his own isolation as a result of his antisocial, cold behavior. He hates being so alone, but is also the cause behind such loneliness.\n\nI think selflessness/sacrifice is another theme present in the film.\n\nDepending on which theory you follow about the time travel stuff, it can be interpreted that Donnie willingly allows himself to be killed by the jet engine that falls through his bedroom.\n\nI also noticed that when Donnie and Gretchen are exiting the theater, the camera clearly focuses on the movie titles. While most are Halloween based, there’s also the movie title of “The Passion of Christ” - which isn’t a Halloween-y movie at all. I feel this was sort of foreshadowing of Donnie, a chosen person given special gifts who ultimately has to sacrifice himself.\n\nHis mother also embodies this theme. Rather than be resentful of her son for his issues or his various outbursts, she completely loves him and accepts him - even saying “it’s wonderful” to have a wacko son. She sacrifices her reputation and a life of normalcy in exchange for being a loving mother to Donnie. Jim Cunningham, meanwhile, is the opposite of selfless. He poses as this wise, benevolent motivational speaker, when in reality he’s a pedophile who uses motivational speaking to mask his darker issues. The same can be said about Kitty Farmer, who is a dance coach that isn’t looking for the girls best interests but is only caring about them succeeding and her living vicariously through them.\n\nUltimately, these themes of isolation and sacrifice connect to form the theme of “destruction leads to creation”. In the ending of the film. Donnie is afraid to die alone, but seconds before being hit by a jet engine - he starts laughing. He is dying alone, but he’s doing it for a selfless cause - one that will save Gretchen and everyone else he loves. In his destruction, he’s leading to the “creation” of everyone else continuing to live. The idea of “destruction leads to creation” is also discussed in Donnie’s literature class.\n\nDo you guys agree?

It stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis, alongside Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland, and Jamie Foxx in supporting roles. The plot follows three friends, played by Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis, who decide to murder their respective overbearing, abusive bosses, portrayed by Spacey, Aniston, and Farrell.\n\nMarkowitz's script was bought by New Line Cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre-production, with a variety of actors attached to different roles. By 2010, Goldstein and Daley had rewritten the script, and the film finally went into production.\n\nThe film premiered in Los Angeles on June 30, 2011, and was released on July 8, 2011. The film exceeded financial expectations, accruing over $28 million in the first three days, making it the number two film in the United States during its opening weekend. The film grossed $209.8 million worldwide by the end of its theatrical run.\n\nThe film received positive reviews, with critics praising the ensemble cast, and each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews. Some reviewers gave praise to the premise and plot, while others commented on the quality of the joke-writing.[5][6] A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, was released on November 26, 2014.\n\n## Plot\n\nNick Hendricks, Dale Arbus and Kurt Buckman are friends working in Riverside, California who despise their bosses: Nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic Dave Harken, who hints at a possible promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself; Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, who threatens to tell his fiancée Stacy that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her; Kurt enjoys working for the kind-hearted Jack Pellit at his chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's arrogant, cocaine-addicted son Bobby, whose apathy and incompetence threatens the future of the company.\n\nAt night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer alive. Initially hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their bosses. In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean \"Motherfucker\" Jones, an ex-con who offers to be their \"murder consultant.\" Jones suggests that they kill each other's bosses to hide their motives, while making the deaths look like accidents.\n\nThe trio poke around Bobby's house, and Kurt steals his phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car as a lookout. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom.\n\nThe next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders. Harken discovers Bobby's phone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, supposing his wife Rhonda is having an affair with him. He drives over and kills Bobby, while Nick secretly witnesses the murder.\n\nNick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are questioned by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, and he was only imprisoned for bootlegging a film. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it.\n\nThe three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee in Kurt’s car, but he gives chase and repeatedly rams them, damaging their car and slowing it down.\n\nBelieving they have committed a crime, the car is remotely disabled by its navigation-system operator, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness.\n\nThe police initially arrest the trio, but the navigation-system operator Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing to Bobby's murder. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company with a raise under a friendly but slightly psychotic CEO; Kurt remains in his position under a promoted co-worker; Dale, with the help of Jones, blackmails Julia into ending her harassment.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop to bottom: Aniston, Farrell and Spacey, who portray the titular bosses.\n\n- Jason Bateman as Nick Hendricks: \nAn executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through hoops in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him.[7] Markowitz wrote the role specifically for Bateman.[8]\n- Charlie Day as Dale Arbus: \nA dental assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss.[7] Described as a \"hopeless romantic\" in love with his fiancée.[9] Day was considered for the role following his co-starring performance with Sudeikis in the 2010 film Going the Distance, a performance which Reuters reported that industry insiders believed overshadowed the main stars.[10]\n- Jason Sudeikis as Kurt Buckman:[11] \nAn account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new, drug-addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies.[12] Sudeikis was cast in May 2010.[13]\n- Jennifer Aniston as Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S.: \nMarkowitz based the character on a former boss, claiming she was \"very sexually aggressive with everybody\". When writing the script, Markowitz intended for the role to go to Aniston.[8] He stated the character \"looked more like Cruella de Vil. It was like flirting with a cobweb.\"[7] Aniston wore a brown wig for the role, wanting to look different from other characters she had played.[14]\n- Colin Farrell as Bobby Pellit: \nDescribed as a \"weaselly scion\"[15] and a \"corrupt and incompetent jerk who's in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he's doing.\"[7][9][16] Farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character, stating \"This guy thinks he's God's gift to women, God's gift to intellect, to humor, to the club scene, to everything [...] With Pellit, Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible.\" Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot-belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons.[9]\n- Kevin Spacey as Dave Harken: \nPresident of Comnidyne Industries.[9] Gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses (rather than one single person) to avoid being sued.[7]\n- Donald Sutherland as Jack Pellit, Bobby's father and Kurt's boss.[9]\n- Jamie Foxx as Dean 'Motherfucker' Jones: \nThe character had the more \"colorful\"[17] name \"Cocksucker Jones\", but it was changed to \"Motherfucker Jones\" at Foxx's request, with producer Jay Stern commenting that Foxx felt it \"was over the line\".[18] Foxx contributed to his character's appearance, suggesting full-scalp tattoos and a retro clothing style. Foxx described the appearance as \"a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he's living in his own time capsule. When he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in.\"[9]\n- Julie Bowen as Rhonda, Harken's wife. Bowen stated that her character \"may or may not be a hussy\", the character described as intentionally making her husband jealous.[9][19]\n- P. J. Byrne as Kenny Sommerfeld, a former investment manager and friend from high school of Nick, Dale and Kurt, now scrounging for drinks.\n- Wendell Pierce and Ron White as Detectives Hagan and Samson, a pair of cops.[9]\n- Lindsay Sloane as Dale's fiancée Stacy.[9]\n\nOn July 27, 2010, Isaiah Mustafa was confirmed as joining the cast, appearing as Officer Wilkens.[20] Ioan Gruffudd has a cameo as a male urophile prostitute erroneously hired as a hitman. Bob Newhart makes a cameo as sadistic Comnidyne CEO Louis Sherman.[21] John Francis Daley, a screenwriter on the film, cameos as Nick's co-worker Carter. Meghan Markle has a role in the film as a FedEx girl.[22] Brian George voices navigation-system operator Gregory, whose real name, Atmanand, the trio have difficulty pronouncing. Chad Coleman appears as a bar owner.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nMichael Markowitz's script for Horrible Bosses was sold at auction to New Line Cinema by Brett Ratner's production company Rat Entertainment in 2005 for a six-figure amount.[23][24] Ratner initially was interested in directing, but became occupied with directing the comedy Tower Heist.[23] Frank Oz and David Dobkin were in talks to direct.[25] Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley rewrote the script in 2010, and the project went into production with Seth Gordon directing.\n\n### Casting\n\nDuring the six-year development of the film, several actors were in negotiations to star, including Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Matthew McConaughey, Ryan Reynolds, Dax Shepard, and Johnny Knoxville.[23][10] Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Jeff Bridges had been approached by New Line Cinema to take the role of Dave Harken, described as a psychopathic master manipulator with an attractive wife. Kevin Spacey signed up for the role in June 2010.[26] Ashton Kutcher was in talks to play Dale Arbus at two different points in the lengthy production, before the role ultimately went to Charlie Day.[23]\n\n### Design\n\n\"It's like we have a team of three people playing against an opposing team of three, with the Jamie Foxx character as referee. We wanted to distinguish these three environments and play the two sides off each other. Each environment is a reflection of the person who controls it.\"\n\nProduction designer Shepherd Frankel specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses' homes and offices. Nick and Harken's workplace is the \"Comnidyne\" bullpen, which was designed to \"enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower-level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office.\" The design team met with financial strategists and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low-ranking position in a cubicle and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with Frankel and set decorator Jan Pascale to match Harken's suit to that of the surrounding \"cold grey and blue\" color palette of his office. Harken's home was described as \"equally lacking in warmth\" as the office but more lavishly decorated and \"for show\", including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his \"trophy wife\".[9]\n\nDesigning Julia's office was described as a \"challenge\", infusing a \"sensual vibe\" into a dental office. Frankel approached the design through Julia's mentality, stating, \"She's a Type A professional at the top of her game, who likes to play cat-and-mouse, so it's a completely controlled environment, with apertures and views into other rooms so she always knows what's going on\". \"It's highly designed, with rich wallpaper and tones, sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting—all very\ndisarming till you step into her private office. The blinds close, the door locks and you think, 'It's the Temple of Doom.'\" Similarly approaching the character's home, the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street \"which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn't get away with at work.\"[9]\n\nBobby's environments were designed with more contrast, the character being new to the work area. Frankel described the contrast as \"the company reflects [Jack Pellitt's] human touch, whereas [Bobby Pellitt's] home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic appetites.\" Frankel continued, \"It features a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and erotic, mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an '80s Studio 54 vibe, a makeshift dojo, lots of mirrors and a massage table.\" Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon's interpretation of the character and his \"infatuation\" with martial arts and \"his delusions of prowess\".[9]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming of Horrible Bosses took place in and around Los Angeles.[27] The production team attempted to find locations \"that people haven't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV\", aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America \"where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss.\" \"Comnidyine\" was represented by an office building in Torrance, California, with the crew building the set on a vacant floor.[9] For \"Pellitt Chemical\", the production team found a \"perfect landscape of pipes and containers\" in Santa Fe Springs, surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility. To take advantage of the surrounding imagery, the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls, including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland's character.[9] A T.G.I. Friday's in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, was used as a bar frequented by Nick, Dale, and Kurt, while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles.[9]\n\nThe film was shot digitally using the Panavision Genesis camera.[28] Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise, though Aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co-stars, stating, \"My dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn’t much that I needed to do\".[29]\n\n### Music\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by award-winning composer Christopher Lennertz, with music contributed by Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Stefan Lessard of Dave Matthews Band and Money Mark—a collaborator with the Beastie Boys.[19] McCready, Lessard, and Mark worked with musicians Matt Chamberlain, David Levita, Aaron Kaplan, Victor Indrizzo, Chris Chaney, Davey Chegwidden and DJ Cheapshot[30] to develop the music.[19] Major contributions were provided by Mark on keyboard, McCready and Levita on guitar, Chaney and Lessard on bass, Indrizzo on drums and DJ Cheapshot on turntables.\n\nHorrible Bosses: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released in physical and digital formats on July 5, 2011, by WaterTower Music.[31][32] The soundtrack consists of 33 tracks with a runtime of 63 minutes.[31][32]\n\n## Release\n\nJason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman at the Sydney premiere in August 2011\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe world premiere of Horrible Bosses took place on June 30, 2011, at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.[33]\n\n### Box office\n\nHorrible Bosses grossed $117.5 million (56.1%) in North America and $92.2 million (43.9%) in other territories for a worldwide gross of $209.8 million, against its budget of $35 million.[4]\n\nHorrible Bosses was released on July 8, 2011, in the United States and Canada across 3,040 theaters.[4] It grossed $9.9 million on the first day, giving it the second largest opening gross for an original R-rated comedy of the summer, behind Bad Teacher ($12.2 million).[34] For the opening weekend, the film took in a total of $28,302,165, an average of $9,310 per theater,[4] making it the number two film for the weekend, behind Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($47.1 million),[35] the second highest-grossing opening weekend for an original R-rated comedy, again behind Bad Teacher ($31.6 million), and the highest-grossing opening weekend ever for a dark/black comedy film, overtaking the 2004 The Stepford Wives ($21.4 million).[35] The opening weekend audience was 51% male, and 64% of the audience were over 25 years of age.[35] The second weekend (15–17 July) saw a further 94 theaters added, for a total of 3,134.[36] Box office revenue dropped by a \"respectable\" 38%, taking $17.6 million for a total gross of $60 million in ten days. The film ranked third for the weekend.[37] It remained in the top five films during its third week, dropping 33% and leaving thirty theaters[36] from the previous weekend, to take in $11.9 million for a gross of $82.6 million in 17 days.[38] On July 28, 2011, with $87.6 million after 20 days, Horrible Bosses surpassed The War of the Roses ($86.8 million) to become the highest grossing dark/black comedy film in unadjusted dollars.[39]\n\nHorrible Bosses was released on July 7, 2011, in the United Arab Emirates ($258,108), and on July 8 in Estonia ($24,471), Latvia ($15,750), Lebanon ($36,316) and Lithuania ($13,676), grossing $348,321 for the opening weekend[40] and accruing a total of $855,009 in the first 17 days.[41] On the weekend of July 21–24, the film opened in the United Kingdom ($3,386,876), Greece ($367,845), Israel ($200,372), South Africa ($193,632), Norway ($109,252) and East Africa ($7,324).[41]\n\n## Reception\n\nCharlie Day was singled out for praise by several critics for his performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHorrible Bosses received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It's nasty, uneven, and far from original, but thanks to a smartly assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise, Horrible Bosses works.\"[42] Review aggregate Metacritic gave the film a score of 57 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[43] On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[44] Male audience members gave the film an \"A−\" compared to females giving it an average rating of \"B+\".[45]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it \"well-cast\" and commending it for playing to each actor's strengths. Ebert gave particular praise to Spacey, labeling him \"superb\", and Aniston, judging her performance to be a \"surprise\" and a return to form, stating \"she has acute comic timing and hilariously enacts alarming sexual hungers\". Ebert called Horrible Bosses \"cheerful and wicked\".[46] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly reacted positively, calling the film \"a bouncy, well-built, delightfully nasty tale of resentment, desperation, and amoral revenge\" and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists.[47] The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin also praised the cast, stating that the picture \"succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while resorting to homicide\", adding the \"acting more than compensates for the film's other failings.\" Rabin singled out Day's performance as \"a potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of charisma.\"[48] Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net credited director Seth Gordon with having assembled \"the perfect cast\", claiming \"the six leads kill in every scene\", but echoed Nathan Rabin's sentiments that Day is the \"real standout\". Douglas summarized the picture as \"dark fun that works better than expected due to a well-developed script, an impeccable cast and a director who knows how to put the two together\".[49] A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated \"the timing of the cast...is impeccable\" and appreciated that the script did not attempt \"to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability\". The review concluded that \"in the ways that count and even when it shouldn’t, Horrible Bosses works.\"[50]\n\nUSA Today's Scott Bowles awarded the film three out of four stars, labeling it a \"surprising comedy that rivals Bridesmaids as the funniest film of the summer, if not the year.\" Bowles added that \"the characters are so likable\", giving particular credit to Sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of Bateman and Day. The dialogue was also lauded by Bowles, which commented that \"Seth Gordon has a deft touch with water-cooler talk—even when the water cooler might be spiked with poison.\"[51] Leonard Maltin of indieWire considered Day to have had the \"breakout role\" and offered praise to the performances of the cast, but lamented the lack of screen time for Farrell's character. Maltin concluded \"the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy, just enough cleverness to admire, and just the right camaraderie among its three male stars, which turns out to be the movie’s greatest strength.\"[52] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave kudos to the \"killer cast\", with specific credit given to Bateman and Day, but was critical of the movie, stating \"it wussies out on a sharp premise\" and that it is a \"hit-and-miss farce that leaves you wishing it was funnier than it is\"[53] The Guardian's Philip French called Horrible Bosses \"a lumbering, misogynistic affair\", but admitted \"I laughed frequently, probably to the detriment of my self-respect.\"[54] Nicholas Barber of The Independent gave a positive review, complimenting Gordon for not allowing the actors' improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing, but felt the movie was not as \"dark\" as its premise required, saying \"what edginess the film does have comes instead from the inordinate quantity of swearing, plus a smattering of homophobia and misogyny.\"[6]\n\nSalon's Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, characterizing the film as a \"lot funnier in theory than in practice, but it won't ruin your Saturday night\". Salon appreciated the \"effortless comic chemistry\" between Sudeikis, Bateman and Day and singled out Bateman, Aniston and Spacey for their performances. O'Hehir was however critical of the perceived homophobia, sexism and racism.[5] The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt responded negatively, stating the jokes failed to be funny, stating \"Seth Gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script...into anything more than a collection of moments in search of laughs.\"[55] Karina Longworth of The Village Voice was critical of the premise, which she felt lacked any legitimate \"rage\" against the characters' bosses, stating \"...there's every sign that, even without these particular emasculators, Dale, Kurt and Nick would still be—for lack of a better word—total pussies.\" Longworth felt that the humor was \"rarely actually laugh-out-loud funny, and never truly dark or daring\". She particularly criticized the all-white, male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with \"stereotypes\".[56] Justin Chang of Variety praised the performance of the ensemble cast, but considered the plot to be \"predictably moronic, vulgar and juvenile\". Chang echoed the sentiments of The Village Voice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to \"darker, more daring territory\" and faulted it for falling back on \"over-the-top comic exaggeration\".[57]\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film received several award nominations, including a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor for Colin Farrell,[58] and three nominations from the 2012 Comedy Awards, including Comedy Actor for Bateman, Comedy Actress for Aniston, and best Comedy Film.[59] Farrell and Aniston were both nominated for Best On-Screen Dirt Bag at the 2012 MTV Movie Awards, with Aniston claiming the award. Farrell also received a nomination for Best On-Screen Transformation.[60]\n\n| List of awards and nominations    | List of awards and nominations    | List of awards and nominations                                 | List of awards and nominations                     | List of awards and nominations    | List of awards and nominations    |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Year                              | Award / Film Festival             | Category                                                       | Recipient(s) and nominee(s)                        | Result                            | Ref.                              |\n| 2011                              | Critic's Choice Awards            | Best Comedy Film                                               | Horrible Bosses                                    | Nominated                         | [61]                              |\n| 2011                              | Satellite Awards                  | Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture                         | Colin Farrell                                      | Nominated                         | [58]                              |\n| 2011                              | Teen Choice Awards                | Choice Summer Movie                                            | Horrible Bosses                                    | Nominated                         | [62]                              |\n| 2012                              | Artios Awards                     | Outstanding Achievement in Casting - Big Budget Comedy Feature | Horrible Bosses - Lisa Beach and Sarah Katzman     | Nominated                         | [63]                              |\n| 2012                              | BMI Film &amp; TV Awards              | Film Music Award                                               | Christopher Lennertz                               | Won                               | [64]                              |\n| 2012                              | Golden Trailer Awards             | Best Comedy TV Spot                                            | Horrible Bosses, Warner Bros., Seismic Productions | Nominated                         | [65]                              |\n| 2012                              | MTV Movie Awards                  | Best On-Screen Dirt Bag                                        | Colin Farrell                                      | Nominated                         | [66] [60]                         |\n| 2012                              | MTV Movie Awards                  | Best On-Screen Dirt Bag                                        | Jennifer Aniston                                   | Won                               | [66] [60]                         |\n| 2012                              | MTV Movie Awards                  | Best On-Screen Transformation                                  | Colin Farrell                                      | Nominated                         | [66] [60]                         |\n| 2012                              | The Comedy Awards                 | Comedy Actor - Film                                            | Jason Bateman                                      | Nominated                         | [59]                              |\n| 2012                              | The Comedy Awards                 | Comedy Actress - Film                                          | Jennifer Aniston                                   | Nominated                         | [59]                              |\n| 2012                              | The Comedy Awards                 | Comedy Film                                                    | Horrible Bosses                                    | Nominated                         | [59]                              |\n\n## Home media\n\nOn July 26, 2011, FX obtained the rights to the network premiere of the film.[67]\n\nHorrible Bosses was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on October 11, 2011 by Warner Home Video.[68] The DVD version sold an estimated 400,682 units in the United States during its first week, earning approximately $6.1 million. It was the number 2 best selling DVD of the week, finishing behind Green Lantern, and the number 3 Blu-ray disc film behind Green Lantern and The Lion King.[69] As of November 2012, it has sold an estimated 1.3 million units and earned $18.3 million.[70]\n\nThe DVD contains the theatrical cut of the film and deleted scenes. The Blu-ray Disc edition contains the Blu-ray Disc, the DVD and a digital version of the film in a single pack. The Blu-ray Disc version is an unrated, extended cut (the \"Totally Inappropriate Edition\") with a runtime of 106 minutes compared to the theatrical 98 minutes.[1][71] The Blu-ray Disc contains deleted scenes and four featurettes: My Least Favorite Career, Surviving a Horrible Boss, Being Mean Is So Much Fun, and The Making of the Horrible Bosses Soundtrack.[71] Both the theatrical and extended cuts are presented in the film's original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 with DTS-HD Master Audio sound.[72] Beginning with the Blu-ray Disc release of Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern, Warner Bros. included a code that allows the owner to access a version of the film via UltraViolet, a cloud storage service which allows streaming or downloading to a variety of devices.[73]\n\n## Sequel\n\nSeth Gordon confirmed in July 2011 that talks were underway for a sequel, after the financial success of the film in the United States, saying: \"Yeah, we've definitely discussed it. It's done well in the States, the film has, so that's becoming a more concerted effort now, we're trying to figure out what the sequel could be.\"[74] On January 4, 2012, it was confirmed that a sequel was moving forward, and that Goldstein and Daley would be returning to write the script. New Line was reported to be negotiating with Gordon to return as director, with Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis also expected to return to their roles.[75] On February 27, 2012, it was confirmed that Goldstein and Daley were in the process of writing the new script.[76] In March 2013, Goldstein and Daley confirmed that they had submitted multiple draft scripts for the sequel, and that production had moved towards finalizing the budget.[77] Later in the same month Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were confirmed to be reprising their roles, with Foxx negotiating to return. The film was again produced by Brett Ratner and Jay Stern. In August 2013, it was announced that Gordon would not be returning to direct because of scheduling conflicts and that the studio was actively searching for a replacement.[78][79] In September 2013, Sean Anders was announced as Gordon's replacement, with John Morris joining the production as a producer. The pair had previously performed a rewrite on Goldstein's and Daley's sequel script.[80] Filming had been scheduled to begin in summer 2013, but began in November 2013.[78][81] Foxx, Aniston, and Spacey reprised their roles, with Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine joining the cast.[82] Horrible Bosses 2 was released on November 26, 2014.\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b \"Horrible Bosses\".

It stars an ensemble cast that includes Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Chris Hemsworth. The plot centers on six strangers and an employee at the El Royale, a hotel located along the California–Nevada border, whose personal secrets intersect on a fateful night in the late 1960s. The film explores themes of morality, faith, and redemption, with the state border and other visual elements symbolizing the concept of right and wrong.\n\nGoddard began writing the spec script for the film in November 2016, and compiled a list of songs into his screenplay. After telling major studios to avoid buying the script if they could not buy the licenses for each piece of music, he sold it to 20th Century Fox in March 2017. Principal photography started in January 2018 with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and finished in April. The El Royale hotel was built entirely on a studio set in Burnaby, Canada, under the supervision of production designer Martin Whist, who had envisioned designing a perfectly symmetrical hotel. Additional filming took place in the United States. During post-production, editing was completed by Lisa Lassek and the musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino.\n\nBad Times at the El Royale's marketing efforts included posters, trailers, and television advertisements, stylized to evoke nostalgia of the noir genre and to make the movie stand out against other films in theaters. The film premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 22, 2018, and released on October 12 in the United States. It underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.9 million against a $32 million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its ensemble cast, cinematography, and soundtrack, but criticized its pacing, runtime, character beats, and were polarized on Goddard’s screenplay. It received various awards and nominations, most notably at the 45th Saturn Awards, for its writing, acting, cinematography, and music.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe El Royale, once popular with the wealthy until losing its gambling license, is a hotel that straddles the California–Nevada border. In 1959, Felix O'Kelly hides a money bag under the floorboards of his room. His accomplice arrives and shoots him dead. A decade later, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and hippie Emily Summerspring arrive at the hotel, now run solely by heroin addict Miles Miller, and book separate rooms.\n\nUpon checking into the honeymoon suite, Laramie begins removing wiretaps but unexpectedly finds a second set as well. After stealing the hotel's master key, he discovers a secret corridor where every room can be observed through one-way mirrors and filmed with a camera. Laramie sees Darlene singing, Daniel removing the floorboards of his room, and Emily holding a young woman captive. In the parking lot, Laramie calls into the FBI, revealing himself to be Special Agent Dwight Broadbeck. He is instructed by J. Edgar Hoover to focus on his mission of collecting the surveillance materials the FBI had planted and ignore the kidnapping. Believing the mission has been compromised, Dwight is advised to prevent the guests from leaving. To do so, Dwight disables their cars.\n\nDaniel invites Darlene to join him for dinner in the hotel lounge. There, Darlene says she is practicing for a performance in Reno and Daniel reveals his memory is deteriorating. While he is getting drinks, she sees him spiking her beverage and knocks him unconscious with a bottle. Miles later finds and revives Daniel, telling him that he wants to undertake a confession but Daniel refuses. Miles, looking for the missing master key, leads Daniel to the secret corridor, explaining that he used to regularly film intimate encounters that he had to send to his superiors. Miles also admits to having withheld one incriminating film of a deceased public figure who had been kind to him. When Daniel leaves to evaluate said film, Miles witnesses through the one-way mirror Dwight attempting to rescue Emily's hostage, revealed to be her younger sister, Rose. When Emily kills Dwight with a shotgun, it also shoots out the mirror, exposing the corridor and injuring Miles.\n\nBefore these events, Emily had forcibly removed her sister from a dangerous cult, led by Billy Lee. In the present, Rose secretly calls Billy to tell him where she is. A witness to Dwight's murder, Darlene tries to escape by car but fails due to his tampering with her vehicle. Daniel enters her car and reveals to her that he is Dock O'Kelly, imprisoned since a bank robbery in 1959. Recently paroled, he arrived in disguise to retrieve the money hidden by his brother Felix, but due to his failing memory, he picked the wrong room and tried to drug Darlene to gain access to hers. To earn her trust, he offers to split the cash with her. They retrieve the money, but Billy and his cult arrive and take them, Emily, and Miles hostage.\n\nIn a flashback, Billy preaches to his cult how people are forced to choose sides by getting Rose to fight another girl for the chance to sleep with him as Emily watches nearby. In the present, a compliant Rose watches Billy as he interrogates the group and finds the film, which he realizes is more valuable than the money. He forces Emily to choose a color in a game of roulette between her and Miles, and kills her when she loses. Before Billy completes another round of roulette, Dock attacks him, a melee ensues, and a fire spreads. When Darlene implores a shell-shocked Miles to help, he reveals that he served in the Vietnam War as a sniper. Miles picks up a gun and kills Billy and his followers, but a distraught Rose stabs him in the stomach before being shot by Dock. Darlene convinces \"Father Flynn\" to absolve Miles of the guilt over his wartime actions before he dies. They then toss the film into the fire and leave with the money. Sometime later, in Reno, Dock attends Darlene's soul performance at a nightclub.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Jeff Bridges as Father Daniel Flynn / Dock O'Kelly\n- Cynthia Erivo as singer Darlene Sweet\n- Dakota Johnson as hippie Emily Summerspring\n- Jon Hamm as Laramie Seymour Sullivan / Dwight Broadbeck\n- Cailee Spaeny as Rose Summerspring, Emily's sister\n- Lewis Pullman as hotel manager Miles Miller\n- Chris Hemsworth as cult leader Billy Lee\n- Nick Offerman as Felix O'Kelly\n- Xavier Dolan as music producer Buddy Sunday\n- Shea Whigham as Dr. Woodbury Laurence\n- Mark O'Brien as bank robber Larsen Rogers\n- Charles Halford as prisoner Sammy Wilds\n- Jim O'Heir as emcee Milton Wyrick\n- Stephen Stanton as the voice of J.

Davis as Judge Gordon Hoffman\n\n## Themes and analysis\n\n### Deconstruction\n\nAs Kyle Kizu from The Hollywood Reporter notes, the filmography of writer and director Drew Goddard has deconstructed specific genres multiple times. When focusing on the 2018 film, he said that it was the filmmaker's \"most controlled and fruitful piece of deconstruction\" as it was able to present its thesis, of \"what looks plain and ordinary hides something beneath\", with its opening scene through a literal metaphor of a man deconstructing a room.[1] While The A.V. Club's Katie Rife noted that the film attempted to deconstruct its neo-noir genre, but that it was instead \"a structurally ambitious example of same\",[2] Matthew Razak of Flixist wrote that the film purposely avoided deconstructing its main genre as it \"mashes together a whole wealth of genres and delivers an utterly unique, unpredictable, and unexpected movie that never stays still long enough to be anything but itself\".[3] In a negative light, Andrew Paredes from News.ABS-CBN.com said that the film's runtime made it difficult to analyze, and that the film could have been \"both a deconstruction and a commentary\" or neither, and that only Goddard could say.[4] When asked if he had focused on deconstructing the genres in his film like he previously did with the horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods in 2011, Goddard said \"It's funny because in both cases that was not conscious either way. I just sort of go with what feels right for the story. Cabin was very aggressive in its approach. Whereas, in this case, [...] it just sort of came out inherently. I didn't want to make it about the genre.\"[5]\n\n### Right and wrong\n\nA major aspect of the film was its visualization of each character's morality. One of its main cues to this was the presence of the California-Nevada border dividing the hotel. In one of the opening scenes, Darlene Sweet takes her time walking across the state line and crosses it only with the help of Father Daniel Flynn, never actually stepping on the line itself. However, characters such as cult leader Billy Lee calmly walk in between the line without a second thought.[6] To further illustrate this idea, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey used color to give each character a \"photographic signature\". With this process, he assigned Billy to the color red for the significance of \"impending doom, blood, and death\", black and white to Daniel to tell his distinctions between the truth and deception, and bright colors to Darlene for her character's hopefulness and purity.[7][8] Goddard said he placed the story in 1969 due to the circumstances and tensions during the decade while drawing inspiration on morality from the techniques used by the Coen brothers.[9][10]\n\n### Crisis of faith\n\n\"The film's purgatory also functions as a microcosm of an America trying to get a grip on its sins from the 1960s; Richard Nixon, J. Edgar Hoover, cruelly casual racism, roguish celebrities, doomed Hollywood starlets, hippie cult leaders, gruesome random murders, and the Vietnam War are all in the story's background. In their own ways, each of the characters represents some element of that decade.\"\n\nAlissa Wilkinson from Vox said the film's themes tackled \"religion, salvation, and who we really are\" and that the film was about \"humanity's drive to find redemption\". Believing that the state line served as the \"existential crossroads\" each character was facing, she came to the conclusion that the hotel was a \"stand-in for purgatory\". She noted that the main point of the use of religion in the film was the idea that confessing would help the characters \"[speak] freely about their past misdeeds in time for someone else to see them for who they really are\".[11] Tracy Palmer, from Signal Horizon, similarly evaluated the story and arrived at the assumption that Daniel was, in fact, God testing six people in purgatory, and as \"Darlene never commits any sin beyond hating herself and aiding a criminal find his money [...] she is rewarded for her charity, and acceptance of self by singing for an audience what she wants, how she wants to look for eternity.\"[12]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Ciara Wardlow said the film had \"a lot to say about faith\". She began her analysis with the mention that the reveal of Daniel not being a priest but bank robber Dock O'Kelly as being similar to \"other invocations of religion\" turning out to be misleading. She explained the decision of Dwight Broadbeck to violate his orders to potentially rescue a kidnapping victim, as his attempt to do what is right after reciting to his daughter a revised version of the prayer \"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep\". After concluding that all the characters in the film were having their faith tested, such as Miles Miller seeking forgiveness for his sins and Billy playing God as a cult leader, Wardlow cited Pascal's wager to summarize the major theme of the project: \"Bad Times repeatedly asks what is 'goodness' even, or forgiveness? And who is qualified to give it, for that matter?\"[6]\n\nFurthermore, a journalist named Jasmine from SSZee Media studied the film and wrote that it was \"a study of religion\" as every character was having a \"crisis of faith\". Focusing on the introduction of Billy Lee and how he uses religion to take advantage of his followers and to pose as a God himself, \"walking the line between good and evil\", Jasmine noted the similarity of his followers to the \"disciples following Jesus\". Also analyzing a scene in which a shot was framed to make Billy appear to have a halo on his head, she interpreted that his character was created to focus more on threatening appearances through his movements and words, calling it \"the performance of Chris Hemsworth's career\".[13]\n\n### The film reel\n\nRumors surrounding the personal life of John F. Kennedy influenced the presence of the film reel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA film reel containing a recently deceased person in an intimate act is destroyed in the film's finale. The choice to never tell the audience the identity of the person on the film was examined by both critics and filmgoers. Screen Rant's Zak Wojnar said the scene would lead the audience to question \"if it should actually matter.\" He said it was possible the person on the film was John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, or Martin Luther King Jr., major political figures who were all assassinated in the 1960s. In his conclusion, Wojnar said the \"key takeaway of the film is that great men aren't perfect. Good people can do bad things, bad people can do good things, and there's more to human beings than the binary poles of righteous and wicked.\"[14] Lia Beck from Bustle, on the other hand, closely examined the possibility of JFK being the person on the tape, as he had been rumored to have had an affair with Marilyn Monroe in the 1960s, who appears in the film through a photograph. She also pointed out that the hotel the El Royale is based on, the Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino, was frequently visited by the Kennedy family.[10][15][16] Goddard said his choice to leave the person on the tape ambiguous was to move the focus on Darlene, her rant towards Billy, and her character as a whole.[17]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nDrew Goddard wrote, directed, and produced the film as his \"love letter to the crime thriller\" genre.[18]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn November 2016, Goddard began writing the spec script to Bad Times at the El Royale, his next project after earning an Academy Award nomination for adapting The Martian (2015).[19] To prepare for the film financially, he pitched the project with a budget and a selection of songs he wanted to be included.[20] 20th Century Fox, who produced The Martian, bought the screenplay on March 8, 2017, agreeing to his terms and setting the budget at $32 million.[20][21][22] According to The Hollywood Reporter, the script was only given to top studio executives, with potential buyers having to read it off a tablet before returning it to a courier.[23] Goddard was also attached to direct for TSG Entertainment and Goddard Textiles, producing alongside Jeremy Latcham. Mary McLaglen was an executive producer.[24]\n\nGumbo is the perfect way to describe it. I love crime fiction, I love film noir, I love big ensemble movies, I love 60s music. So much of this movie is about my love for the music of the 1960s and wanting to celebrate the artistic revolution that was happening. I take all of those things and throw it into the gumbo pot, spice it up with a little [of] my own stuff, and out comes El Royale.\n\nThe El Royale was influenced by the Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino, a hotel located in between the California–Nevada border. Goddard said he wanted to work with an ensemble cast after finishing The Martian with lead actor Matt Damon because he \"wanted to play around with a large cast so that you don't know who the protagonist is.\"[15] On further inspirations, Goddard said his cast and crew watched several films throughout the film's production, including Casablanca (1942), Out of the Past (1947), Chinatown (1974), and Barton Fink (1991), along with reading several novels from Jim Thompson, Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett, James Ellroy, and Flannery O'Connor.[15][26] He also compared the film to The Good Place, a television comedy series he executive produced, saying they were \"two sides of the same coin. They're both about characters struggling to be better people and trying to figure out what it means to be a better person. One is a very broad comedy, the other is a dark noir. But at the core, they are about characters.\"[27]\n\n### Casting\n\nCynthia Erivo plays soul singer Darlene Sweet. She was cast in the singing role in August 2017 and helped Goddard develop a scene.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGoddard chose to spend more time developing his characters than looking for actors who would best fit the roles.[28] Jeff Bridges was the first person to receive the script,[29] and on August 23, 2017, it was announced he had been in negotiations to star alongside Chris Hemsworth, who previously worked with the director on The Cabin in the Woods.[30][31] Actors who were also being considered for lead roles included Beyoncé, Tom Holland, and newcomer Cailee Spaeny;[32] the latter was officially cast on August 24.[33]\n\nCynthia Erivo was first considered for a lead role while working on Widows. She submitted two audition tapes to casting director Carmen Cuba and was cast on August 29, 2017.[34][35][36] When asked about Erivo's audition process, Goddard said he \"felt the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It was pretty exciting the day she walked in, that's for sure.\"[19] Erivo would go on to help Goddard write her character's climactic monologue directed at Hemsworth's character, Billy Lee, explaining that as the only lead character who is a woman of color, that if her character \"doesn't have a moment where she can just speak, it will seem as though we don't want her to\".[37]\n\nIn January 2018, Dakota Johnson joined the film; Russell Crowe signed on to star but dropped out shortly before filming began.[38][39] To quickly find his replacement, Jon Hamm was contacted while attending the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and given two days to read the screenplay and decide whether he wanted to star.[20][40][41] After accepting, he had less than a week to remember fourteen pages of dialogue before filming began.[42][15] Hamm noted a major reason he accepted to star was to work with Bridges and said, \"I've wanted to work with [Bridges] since I was in college or even younger. So to get that opportunity, you gotta jump with both feet\".[43] In February, Nick Offerman and Mark O'Brien were spotted on set.[44] Lewis Pullman was confirmed to star in May 2018.[45] On casting Pullman, Goddard said \"it was one of those good old-fashioned casting searches. After meeting with lots and lots and lots of actors, Lewis came in and you just felt that immediately. The last time that happened, quite honestly, was when Chris Hemsworth walked in for The Cabin in the Woods. You're just looking for actors who inherently fit the role — and then also transcend the role. Lewis had that sort of magic.\"[19]\n\n### Filming and design\n\n#### Costumes\n\nCostume designer Danny Glicker created each character's attire and found Goddard's \"visual vocabulary\" to be \"playful and sharp\". Glicker said his job was to create \"real tension\" in each character \"between their outward appearance and who they really are\". To create the design for Hamm's character, a salesman, Glicker and his production crew researched different types of salespeople and used the documentary Salesman (1969) as inspiration, before deciding that his attire, described as being \"very American\", would change as the temperature in the film changed as well. On the other hand, the clothing of Erivo's character, lounge singer Darlene Sweet, was purposely created to look imperfect to reflect her declining career.[46] Glicker said he had to screen test each piece of clothing due to conditions presented in the film, such as the weather, environment, and lighting, and that he spent time at the library researching different types of clothing from the 1960s.[47] Summarizing his work, Glicker felt that actors wearing his created costumes were \"infused with truthful information [...] to experience that character's life without inhibition\".[46]\n\n#### Principal photography\n\nPrincipal photography took place between January 29 and April 6, 2018, in areas around Vancouver, British Columbia, where an incentive was given in the form of a 28% refundable tax credit.[48][49][50] The film was shot under the working title Purple Harvest and filmed in chronological order to improve continuity.[18][51][52] After working on The Greatest Showman (2017), Seamus McGarvey was hired to bring out the \"1960s look\" and \"beautiful colors\" of each set.[7][53] Shot with Kodak 35mm film with a Panaflex XL camera on a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, McGarvey used Panavision C Series and E series anamorphic lenses to capture the film.[54][55][56]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrincipal photography took place in the Canadian province of . Filming locations included Pioneer Avenue in   and 's Mammoth Studios .\n\nSeveral actors took pay cuts to complete the project and allow the production to \"take big creative bets\".[20][57] For the first few days of the shoot, filming for the main bank robbery sequence took place in Pioneer Avenue in Agassiz, British Columbia.[51][58] The following week, cast members were moved to Mammoth Studios, a 60,000 square foot (5,600 m2) sound stage in Burnaby featuring a 10,000 square foot (930 m2) set of the El Royale.[55][59] Early in the production, the film crew realized they could not find a real place with perfect symmetry to film, and Goddard also wanted the weather to be controllable, thus the decision to build the set in Burnaby.[5] The set was created under the supervision of production designer Martin Whist, who had previously worked with Goddard on Cloverfield (2008) and The Cabin in the Woods.[5][59][46] Each hotel room of the set was designed to be unique to each character, particularly through their wallpaper, with Darlene's room being the most vibrant.[60][61]\n\nIt took eight months to plan a tracking shot in which Hamm's character discovers the secret corridor of the El Royale and watches the hotel guests through one-way mirrors.[61] Rehearsals of the scene began in November 2017, with the cast working with a model of the hotel and small figurines to research how to perfect the timing.[41] Due to the complexity of the scene, in which Erivo was singing live for the five-minute continuous shot, cast and crew members had to move silently in unison while wearing \"padded shoes and quiet clothes\".[19] Using \"30% reflective glass\" for the one-way mirrors,[53] the scene took an entire day between twenty-seven takes to accomplish.[18][26][62] An additional scene in which Erivo's character sings to cover up noises caused by Bridges's character took twenty takes to complete.[63] Furthermore, the set of a scene involving Billy Lee and his cult talking around a bonfire was built outside the parking lot of the hotel set.[60]\n\nThe scene showing the first interaction between Daniel and Darlene was one of the last scenes shot for the film as it was built on location to have the scene occur during the day; every other scene taking place inside the hotel was shot on the set at Mammoth Studios.[64][65] The film's climax scene in which the hotel burns down was planned using fire retardant materials by Whist's brother Joel, a special effects coordinator.[64] The last scenes that were shot for the film involved flashbacks; the Vietnam War scene, originally going to be shot in Thailand, was filmed at the Pölsa Rosa Movie Ranch in Acton, California, while the FBI scene, doctor's office scene, and jail scene were shot in an armory from the Canadian Army. Additional filming in Los Angeles and north of Malibu, California, took place for three days when scenes involving a flower walk and a beach were shot.[55][66][67] McGarvey said he used a wide aspect ratio to shine focus on the ensemble cast.[53]\n\n### Editing\n\nLisa Lassek edited the film using Avid Media Composer; she previously worked with Goddard on The Cabin in the Woods. Lassek said she had to wait for the film stock to travel to Los Angeles, where it was processed and returned to Vancouver. As a result, Lassek was permitted to edit the project as filming took place while in a workspace above the set. Due to the delay, the footage shown in the film on television monitors was shot first so the original film stock could be projected on said monitors weeks later. After post-production concluded near the start of October 2018, the finished product reached an Avid DNxHD 115 resolution. On working with the director, she said there were various \"scenes that, in the script, were particularly memorable. It was really the way Drew shot them that took them to a whole [new] level.\"[52]\n\n### Soundtrack\n\nGoddard wrote each song into his screenplay before pitching it for an \"organic process of structuring the film and the songs\" and told major studios to avoid buying the script if they could not buy the licenses for each piece of music.[63][29] He described the film as \"a love letter to music\" and served as a music supervisor.[68] Goddard had Erivo sing her songs live on set with the belief that without it, \"the movie would not work\".[20] Goddard said that the music was \"almost like the eighth character in the movie. It serves the function of a chorus in a Shakespearean play. It actually is a key part of the emotional fabric of the film.\"[69] As a result, the production crew had each song playing during filming on loudspeakers; Pullman and Bridges said they had originally read the script while listening to the songs in the background as a \"great way to set the tone\".[70] In introducing the character of cult leader Billy Lee with \"Twelve Thirty\", Goddard said he wanted to provide a metaphorical connection with the character, as the song is \"very bright and seductive, but when you really listen to what the words are saying, there's an incredible darkness\".[69]\n\nThe film score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had met Goddard while working on television series Alias and Lost.[18] Both the score and its accompanying soundtrack album were released on digital download by Milan Records and Republic Records, on October 12, 2018.[71][72] The original tracklist for the soundtrack featured eleven prerecorded songs, while a digital re-release on November 30, 2018,[73] included two additional songs; \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\", performed by Erivo in the film.[74][75] Following its re-release, the soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. Polygon's Karen Han called it \"one of the year's best\".[75] Angelica Florio from Bustle said that \"between the music [...] and Darlene's show-stopping performances, you definitely get the sense that the song selection was key for Goddard\".[76]\n\n## Marketing\n\n| External videos                                                                      | External videos                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Official trailer of Bad Times at the El Royale on 20th Century Fox's YouTube channel | Official trailer of Bad Times at the El Royale on 20th Century Fox's YouTube channel |\n\nThe marketing campaign from 20th Century Fox for Bad Times at the El Royale began on May 29, 2018, when \"exclusive\" images of the project were released and Drew Goddard said \"real-life historical figures could turn up at the El Royale\".[77][78] A teaser for the film was publicized on June 7, 2018,[79] with Entertainment Weekly calling it a \"tense first look\" and IndieWire comparing its premise to Clue (1985) and the television series Room 104.[80][81] On August 28, an official trailer was released, which Collider described as \"fantastic\" as it was \"more delightful for the fact that it reveals pretty much nothing beyond the basic setup and the idea that none of these strangers is who they at first appear to be\".[82] In a trailer breakdown with Empire, who described it as an \"instant blast of glossy genre intrigue\", Goddard revealed the names of each character and said, \"If it was really up to me, I'd say the less you know the better. I take very great care in giving the audience something they've never seen before and surprising the audience, and taking them to places that they do not expect to go.\"[83]\n\nPromotional and theatrical posters for the film were released extensively to broadcast the ensemble cast. On June 26, 2018, eight character posters were unveiled by the studio,[84] with Ben Pearson from /Film noting the \"progression of the setting sun\" and \"how the amount of light in each poster seems to mirror what we know about the characters so far\".[85] On August 13, seven additional character posters along with an official theatrical poster were released featuring \"closeups of the brooding main characters lit by the title's neon glow\".[86][87] On August 28, a second theatrical poster was publicized to coincide with the release of the official trailer.[88]\n\nTelevision spots began airing on September 4, 2018. In the week starting September 17, seven commercials made 223.4 million impressions across 28 networks, particularly on NBC and FOX.[89] In the final week of September, Bad Times at the El Royale had eleven versions of similar advertisements aired 773 times nationwide, gaining an attention score of 93.42 (as well as an attention index of 109).[90] In the first week of October, eighteen commercials made over 378 million impressions.[91] With its following week from October 8 to October 14 being its last time as one of the top five projects with the highest commercial spending, twenty-two commercials aired a total of 1,331 times on 34 networks, specifically on Adult Swim and NBC, bringing the film's overall television advertisement spending to $24.46 million.[92] On December 21, 2018, a 10-minute \"extended preview\" scene of the film was released,[93] with Collider questioning the studio's decision, writing that it was \"something they should have done back in October, but it is what it is\".[94]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Chris Thilk analyzed the marketing techniques of Bad Times at the El Royale, summarizing the fact that the studio was \"[betting] on noir nostalgia\" to attract audiences. In what he believed was \"established neon-heavy branding\", Thilk said each of the released posters was \"hinting in some way toward the nature or arc\" of each character. On the trailers, he wrote that viewers were unable to \"describe what's going\" and were left \"raising lots of questions\". After discussing the initial footage being released at CinemaCon and San Diego Comic-Con, where filmgoers were also allowed to enter a lottery for the chance of seeing an exclusive screening of the film, Thilk tackled the various clips, featurettes, and television spots produced to advertise the film. In his summary, he wrote that the marketing campaign \"promoted a strong cast and a wicked sense of humor\", and that 20th Century Fox \"has embraced that to sell it to those looking for something a bit different at the theater\".[95]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nJoss Whedon, who previously collaborated with Goddard, attended the film's premiere and praised it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBad Times at the El Royale premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 22, 2018. It was attended by its crew, cast, and fellow filmmakers and actors including Manny Jacinto, Alvina August, Stefan Kapičić, Bill Pullman (the father of actor Lewis Pullman, who stars in the film), and Joss Whedon along with 20th Century Fox chairman and CEO Stacey Snider and vice chairman Chris Aronson.[34] At the opening, Whedon gave the film positive feedback, having previously worked with Goddard on writing The Cabin in the Woods, and said of the finished product, \"It's gritty, it's hard-edged, but it's adorable.\"[34] The film was one of the last screened projects at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, and later had its world premiere in Spain, out of competition, at the San Sebastián International Film Festival.[96][97][98]\n\nThe film's runtime of 141 minutes was chosen after negative scores appeared during test screenings where audiences were given a viewing of the film with a shorter runtime.[20][99] It was initially scheduled for release on October 5, 2018,[100] but was later postponed to October 12. This shift was reportedly made to avoid competition with the October 5 releases of Venom and A Star Is Born.[101][102][103] After it opened in theaters, the film was chosen to introduce the 13th Rome Film Festival, serving as its Italian premiere.[104] At the ceremony, Goddard said his film contained \"parallels to the #MeToo movement\" on the topic of abusing power.[27]\n\n### Home media\n\n20th Century Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Digital HD via digital distribution on December 18, 2018, before giving it a physical release on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on January 1, 2019.[105][106] Special features on the physical release include several featurettes, a 28-minute making-of documentary, both trailers, and an image gallery.[106][107][108] In separate reviews, Chris Evangelista from /Film and Adam Chitwood from Collider both expressed their disappointment at the lack of an audio commentary track from the director.[106][107]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nBad Times at the El Royale grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $14 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $31.9 million against a production budget of $32 million.[109] A box-office bomb, its performance was credited to its runtime, competition, and R-rating from the Motion Picture Association.[110]\n\nBox office analytics projected the film would make $8–12 million in its opening weekend from 2,808 theaters, with some \"ambitious estimates\" going as high as $17 million.[111][112] Bad Times at the El Royale earned $2.8 million on its first day (including $575,000 from Thursday night previews) and went on to debut to $7.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing seventh at the box office.[113][114] Opening below initial estimates,[115] Deadline Hollywood noted the fact that the film had made less in its first weekend than Night School in its third. Audiences during the film's opening weekend were 53% male and 73% above the age of 25.[116][117] In its second weekend, the film made $3.4 million and dropped to ninth place at the box office.[118] The film was pulled from theaters in the U.S. and Canada on December 6, 2018.[114]\n\nWorldwide, Bad Times at the El Royale debuted in 36 markets, making $4 million in its opening weekend;[115] the top countries were Russia ($913,000), Australia ($884,000), the United Kingdom ($620,000), and Germany ($315,000).[117][119] The film earned $2.5 million in its second weekend and $1.63 million in its third from 49 markets.[120][121]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of 256 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Smart, stylish, and packed with solid performances, Bad Times at the El Royale delivers pure popcorn fun with the salty tang of social subtext.\"[122] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 60 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[123] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale.[116]\n\nThe film was criticized for its runtime, character beats, and pacing.[2] Additionally, Goddard's screenplay for the film received mixed reviews, with some praising it for its dialogue and use of violence,[124][125] others comparing it to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994) and Stanley Kubrick's The Killing (1956),[2][24][126] and several critics finding its third act failed to deliver the ending it was building towards.[127][128] From NPR, Simon Abrams noted Goddard's directorial style, and how he was able to keep his \"hyper-compartmentalized plot moving forward so swiftly\" despite its moments of tension and significant plot points.[129] On the other hand, Glenn Kenny from RogerEbert.com did not enjoy the film's finale, writing that it was \"an unfortunately apt demonstration of what can befall a clever filmmaker who gets too clever\".[130]\n\nOther aspects of the film, such as its soundtrack and cinematography, received praise.[131] Critics agreed that McGarvey's cinematography made the film visually appealing because of its composition and color palette.[107][132] The film's performances, also received praise and were mostly well received.[11] While The A.V. Club's Katie Rife criticized Spaeny's character, she praised Erivo's monologue near the climax of the film.[2] Collider's Adam Chitwood said Erivo's acting made Bad Times at the El Royale \"one of the best films of the year\".[133] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt gave praise to Erivo for her \"steely charisma and gorgeous powerhouse of a voice\".[134] Abrams also gave positive feedback to the film for its ability to give each member of the ensemble cast enough time to act out their \"best,\"[129] with Manohla Dargis from The New York Times writing that \"the performances and the visual style keep you easily engaged [...] Goddard keeps everything smoothly, ebbing and flowing as the characters separate and join together, but at some point [...] you want something more substantial\".[125]\n\n### Accolades\n\nFor her performance, Erivo received nominations for the Black Reel Award for Outstanding Breakthrough Performance, Female,[135] the London Film Critics' Circle Award for Supporting Actress of the Year,[136] and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress.[137] A member of the British Society of Cinematographers, McGarvey was nominated by the organization for Best Cinematography in a Theatrical Feature Film.[138] The film was also nominated at the Golden Trailer Awards for Best Home Ent Horror/Thriller and received a San Diego Film Critics Society award nomination for Best Use of Music in a Film.[139][140][141] At the 45th Saturn Awards, it received Best Thriller Film and nominations for Best Writing (Goddard), Best Actor (Bridges), Best Supporting Actor (Pullman), and Best Supporting Actress (Erivo).[142]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Kizu, Kyle (October 13, 2018). \"Bad Times at the El Royale and How to Deconstruct a Genre\".

While the car company rather quickly shuts off the car, she does spend a few minutes driving away, presumably at high speed (based on the engine noise). And yet after she stops, Stevens shows up almost immediately. There would be no way for him to reach her that quickly on foot.\n\n- QuotesPolice Officer: Jesus christ, what happened to you?Grace: In-laws.\n\n- Crazy creditsAt the very end of the credits, a disembodied voice says, \"Ready or not, here I come!\"\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews: Ready or Not (2019)\n\n- SoundtracksLove Me Tender\nWritten by Vera Matson and Elvis Presley\nPerformed by Chuck Jackson\nCourtesy of Gusto Records, Inc.\n\n### User reviews1.2K\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Great fun gem of a movie\n\nPeople rating this movie a 1 or 2 are simply just wrong. Your reasons for a low rating like that is just ridiculous. It's a comedy horror and clearly states that and the trailer clearly shows you that. Sooooo why moan about it having comedic moments in the movie? Just plain dumb.\n\nThis is a comedy horror done right, it's dark humour breaks up the gore and violence up perfectly. The characters are perfect from the creepy over the top aunt to the leading protagonist Samara weaving. Acting is on point and the movie never slows up(dig to the crazy person saying it's boring)\n\nThe movie actually has an ending, and what a great ending too. The movie delivers on everything they intended to give you and more.\n\nSooo don't listen to the non constructive low critics and make your own decision and go watch\n\n- scottliddle76\n- Nov 23, 2019\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is Ready or Not?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 24, 2019 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Canada\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official Instagram\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Latin\n- Also known as\n    - Boda sangrienta\n- Filming locations\n    - Parkwood Estate, Oshawa, Ontario, Canada(Le Domas Estate)\n- Production companies\n    - Fox Searchlight Pictures\n    - Mythology Entertainment\n    - Vinson Films\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $6,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $28,714,231\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $8,015,590\n    - Aug 25, 2019\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $57,615,777\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 35 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the streaming release date of Ready or Not (2019) in Japan?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Russell. The film is based on Matthew Quick's 2008 novel The Silver Linings Playbook. It stars Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, with Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Shea Whigham, Anupam Kher and Julia Stiles in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is set in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Cooper plays Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Jr., a man with bipolar disorder who is released from a psychiatric hospital and moves back in with his parents (De Niro and Weaver). Pat is determined to win back his estranged wife. He meets a young widow, Tiffany Maxwell (Lawrence), who offers to help him get his wife back if he enters a dance competition with her. The two become closer as they train, and Pat, his father, and Tiffany examine their relationships with each other as they cope with their situations.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012, and was released in the United States on November 16, 2012.[3] The film opened to critical acclaim, with praise for Russell's direction and screenplay, and the performances of Cooper and Lawrence. It grossed $236.4 million worldwide. A recipient of several accolades, it received eight nominations at the 85th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, with Lawrence winning the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\n## Plot\n\nAfter eight months' treatment in a mental health facility for bipolar disorder, Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Jr. is released into the care of his parents, Patrizio Sr. and Dolores, at his childhood home in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania. His primary focus is to reconcile with his ex-wife, Nikki. She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after he found her in the shower with another man and badly beat him.\n\nPat's therapist, Cliff Patel, tries to convince him to keep taking his medication because a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: He attempts to see the good, or silver linings, in all that he experiences.[4] Meanwhile, Pat experiences a series of anxiety attacks.\n\nPat attends dinner at his best friend Ronnie's house, where Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell, a widow with an unnamed disorder, is also a guest. They connect, talking about different psychiatric medications they have taken to manage their mental illnesses. She tries to offer him casual sex, but Pat is focused on getting Nikki back. Trying to get closer to him, Tiffany offers to deliver a letter to Nikki if, in return, he partners with her in an upcoming dance competition. Convinced that helping Tiffany will show Nikki he has changed and has developed sensitivity to others, Pat agrees. Pat and Tiffany start practicing over the following weeks.\n\nHoping to open a restaurant, Patrizio Sr. has resorted to illegal bookmaking. Having bet most of his money on a Philadelphia Eagles game, Patrizio asks Pat to attend for good luck, irrationally believing Pat's attention to the game affects its outcome. Pat points out this is OCD ideation but appeases his father. Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, which cautiously hints they may be able to reconcile. Before entering the stadium, Pat and his brother Jake get into a fight with racist fans and are arrested. The Eagles lose the game, and Patrizio is furious.\n\nWhen Patrizio claims that the Eagles lost because of Tiffany's newfound involvement in Pat's life, she refutes his allegations by pointing out that Philadelphia sports teams had done better whenever she and Pat were together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a parlay with his friend Randy: If the Eagles win their week 16 game against the Dallas Cowboys and Tiffany and Pat score five out of ten in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet.\n\nPat is reluctant, but Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade him to dance in the competition, telling him Nikki will be there. Noticing that the letter from Nikki includes the phrase \"If it's me reading the signs...\", frequently used by Tiffany, he realizes that Tiffany fabricated the letter. Tiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she sees Nikki in the audience, invited by Ronnie and his wife Veronica. They want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat, giving them the chance to reconcile. Tiffany starts to drink heavily at the bar.\n\nPat finds Tiffany moments before their turn and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Cowboys. After their set, Tiffany and Pat receive an average score of exactly 5.0 points amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd. Pat approaches Nikki and whispers into her ear. Seeing this, Tiffany runs off. Pat Sr. tells his son that unlike Nikki, Tiffany really loves him, and he should not let her go, as it would haunt him for the rest of his life. Pat catches Tiffany and hands her a letter in which he admits to knowing she forged the letter earlier. He confesses that he loved her from the moment they became acquainted, but that it took him a long time to realize and accept it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Bradley Cooper as Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Jr., a former teacher and recent divorcee[5][6][7]\n- Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany Maxwell, a young widow[8]\n- Robert De Niro as Patrizio \"Pat\" Solitano Sr., Pat and Jake's father[6][7]\n- Jacki Weaver as Dolores Solitano, Pat and Jake's mother[9]\n- Anupam Kher as Cliff Patel, Pat's doctor and friend[10]\n- Chris Tucker as Danny McDaniels, a good friend of Pat from the psychiatric hospital\n- Julia Stiles as Veronica Maxwell, Tiffany's sister[11]\n- Shea Whigham as Jake Solitano, Pat's brother\n- John Ortiz as Ronnie, Veronica's husband, Pat's best friend, and Tiffany's brother-in-law\n- Brea Bee as Nikki Solitano, Pat's unfaithful ex-wife\n- Cheryl Williams as Tiffany and Veronica's mother\n- Patrick McDade as Tiffany and Veronica's father\n- Dash Mihok as Officer Keogh\n- Matthew Russell as Ricky D'Angelo\n- Paul Herman as Randy\n- Patsy Meck as Nancy, the principal of the school where Pat and Nikki worked\n- Phillip Chorba as Jordie, Tiffany Maxwell's ex-boyfriend[12]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nRenee Witt, an executive at The Weinstein Company, convinced Harvey Weinstein to option the book by Matthew Quick on which the film is based,[13] doing so before it was published.[14] Sydney Pollack then began developing for David O. Russell to direct.[13] Pollack told Russell that the film adaptation would be tricky because of the story's mixture of troubling emotion, humor, and romance. Russell estimates he rewrote the script[15] twenty times over five years. Russell was drawn to the story because of the family relationships and the connection he felt to his own son, who has bipolar disorder and OCD.[16][17]\n\nThe film was shot in 33 days. A darker, more extreme version of the dance sequence was filmed and scenes with De Niro's character were shot in multiple versions, with the character harsher or warmer, as Russell worked with editor Jay Cassidy to set the balance they wanted.[16]\n\nThe locations are Upper Darby, Ridley Park, and Lansdowne communities just outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although not mentioned by name in the film, Ridley Park is credited at the end, and a police officer can be seen wearing the initials \"RPPD\" on his collar.[18]\n\nThe film takes place over the second half of the 2008 NFL football season,[19] which saw the Philadelphia Eagles advance to the NFC Championship Game. Several games are mentioned, including the Eagles' victories over Seattle and San Francisco, their losses to two of their NFC East rivals Washington Redskins[20] and the New York Giants (which was the game Pat was attending when the fight broke out), and their victory over Dallas in the regular season's final game.\n\n### Casting\n\nRussell initially intended to make the film with Vince Vaughn and Zooey Deschanel, but went on to make The Fighter instead.[16][17][21] Mark Wahlberg was set to work with Russell for the fourth time but had to drop out after delays in production created a scheduling conflict.[22]\n\nRussell had originally planned to work with Bradley Cooper on an adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, having been impressed with Cooper's performance in Wedding Crashers (2005), citing his \"good bad-guy energy\" and unpredictability as justification for casting.[23] Cooper told Russell \"he had been heavier and angrier and more fearful\" at the time of that performance and had drawn on those feelings for it. Russell was excited that Cooper would bring those qualities to Pat Solitano.[16][17]\n\nAnne Hathaway was cast as Tiffany Maxwell, but due to scheduling conflicts with The Dark Knight Rises and creative differences with Russell, she dropped out.[5][24][25] Other actresses who were considered for the part included Elizabeth Banks, Kirsten Dunst, Angelina Jolie, Blake Lively, Rooney Mara, Rachel McAdams, Andrea Riseborough and Olivia Wilde.[17][21][22][26][27]\n\nInitially, Russell did not believe Lawrence's age was suitable for the role.[17][21] He thought Lawrence (21 at the time of filming) was too young to play opposite Cooper (37), but her audition changed his mind, admitting that the \"expressiveness in her eyes and in her face\" was \"ageless\".[14][28] Russell compares Lawrence to the character Tiffany, describing her as confident but one of the least neurotic people he knows, with the confidence and glimpses of vulnerability needed to play Tiffany.[14] Tiffany went through several iterations. She was initially meant to be goth. Lawrence dyed her hair black and did test shoots in heavy goth makeup, but Weinstein disapproved. The final version of her character remained messed-up yet confident, with small goth touches such as the dark hair and a cross.[14] Specifically for the role, Lawrence was asked by Russell to put on weight[29] and to speak in a lower register.[14]\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, Lawrence said she didn't have a handle on Tiffany at first, which was what excited her about the role. \"She was just a character I one-hundred percent did not understand at all... She's like, 'I'm messed up, I'm not like everybody else, I've got issues. Take it or leave it because I like myself.'\"[30]\n\nLawrence and Cooper had no previous dance experience. In less than a month, Mandy Moore, a choreographer for So You Think You Can Dance, taught them the dance sequences. Moore describes Cooper as having \"some real natural dancing ability\".[31][32] Lawrence said of the climactic ballroom dance, \"None of that was improvised, absolutely not. I'm a terrible dancer, so I would never have been able to do any of that. When it finally came together, that scene really was just as fun as it feels.\"[30]\n\n## Music\n\nThe musical score is composed by Danny Elfman. Silver Linings Playbook: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack to the film released by Sony Music Entertainment on November 16, 2012 featuring songs heard in the film.[33] Elfman's score for the film was also released simultaneously with the song album.[34]\n\n## Release\n\nSilver Linings Playbook premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012,[35] where it won the People's Choice Award.[36] It opened at the 2012 Mumbai Film Festival on October 18, 2012,[37][38] and received a limited release in the United States on November 16, 2012, opening wider later that week.[35]\n\nThe Weinstein Company initially planned an unusually wide release for Silver Linings Playbook, going nationwide on an estimated 2,000 screens. They were encouraged by positive reviews and hoping to capitalize on Thanksgiving to do more business. Instead, they took a more slow-burn approach, opening in fewer theaters, expanding gradually, in a strategy to build up word-of-mouth support.[39][40][41] Continuing the slow release, the film expanded to 700 theaters on December 25.[42]\n\n### Home media\n\nSilver Linings Playbook was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 30, 2013, by Anchor Bay Entertainment.\n[43]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nSilver Linings Playbook earned $443,003 in its opening weekend from 16 locations, facing strong competition from films including Skyfall and Lincoln.[44] Expanding to 367 locations in its second week, the film moved to ninth place with $4.4 million.[45] By December 30, it was showing at 745 theaters and had earned $27.3 million.[46] On January 18, 2013, it earned $12.7 million when it expanded to 2,523 theaters, which boosted its total to $56.7 million.[47] In its second weekend of playing in over 2500 theaters, its sales only declined by 12.2%. Gitesh Pandya stated it was well on its way to reaching the $100 million mark and could go much higher if it remained durable over the weeks.[48]\n\nRay Subers forecast the film would earn $100 million, predicting that the film would start slow but keep going through December and gain a wide audience, bringing in fans of Cooper and Lawrence from their work on big franchise films, The Hangover and The Hunger Games, respectively.[49] The film surpassed the $100 million mark in North America on February 19, 2013.[50]\n\n### Critical response\n\nSilver Linings Playbook premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival and was critically acclaimed. The film has an approval rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 260 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Silver Linings Playbook walks a tricky thematic tightrope, but David O. Russell's sensitive direction and sharp work from a talented cast gives it true balance.\"[51] On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds an average score of 81, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[52] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[53]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLawrence and Cooper received widespread critical acclaim for their performances and , with Lawrence winning making her the  winner.\n\nCooper and Lawrence were lauded for their performances.[54][55][56][57][58][59] Kevin Jagernauth of The Playlist praised the film as \"an enormously entertaining, crowd-pleasing winner\" and noted that the performances from the two leads were \"carefully developed, and perfectly pitched\", deserving of awards.[60] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said that \"the chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence makes them a delight to watch\" and that their performances anchor the ensemble cast who also give great performances even in small roles. Rooney also complimented the \"invigorating messiness\" and \"nervous energy\" of the choreography.[61] Richard Corliss of Time magazine also applauded the performances of the leads, particularly Lawrence, stating that her performance is \"the reason to stay\" to watch the whole film, and praising her maturity.[62]\n\nRussell's direction was also widely acclaimed, with Justin Chang of Variety writing: \"Never one to shy away from unlikely sources of comedy, David O. Russell tackles mental illness, marital failure and the curative powers of football and dance with bracingly sharp and satisfying results.\"[63] Eric Kohn of Indiewire gave the film an \"A−\" grade, praising Russell's direction and the performances of Cooper and Lawrence, stating that \"both as solo screenwriter and director, Russell assembles a small, bubbly cast for an unexpectedly charming romcom that frequently dances — at one point, quite literally — between cynicism and bittersweetness with largely winning results.\"[64] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked on Russell's skill, noting how \"in any other hands, the adaptation of Matthew Quick's novel would be the stuff of banal rom-com fluff or, perhaps worse, self-consciously quirky indie cliches.\"[65]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of four stars, saying that the film was \"so good, it could almost be a terrific old classic\" and described Russell's screenplay as \"ingenious\" for the way the major concerns of both the father and son pivot on the final bet.[66] Kenneth Turan called the film \"a complete success\" and the actors' performances \"superb,\" including Chris Tucker in an \"irresistible\" supporting turn.[67] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer called the film \"a transcendent endeavor, from its exhilaratingly smart screenplay... to the unexpected and moving turns of its two leads.\"[68] Ricardo Baca of The Denver Post praised how the film managed to maintain \"the awkward laughs, giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer\" for its entire length.[69] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it \"one of the year's best films. It's crazy good.\"[70]\n\nNegative reviews of the film came from The New Yorker, whose critic David Denby called it \"a miscalculation from beginning to end\" and found Cooper's character \"tiresome\",[71] while Richard Brody found Linings perhaps to \"be the year's most artificial film\" and \"the plot [...] utterly ridiculous.\"[72] In a rare step outside the magazine's typical practices, Brody revisited the film and wrote a supplementary review, once again condemning it as having \"no characters but sets of switches, each of which has a binary set of options and all of which have to line up for things to come out right.\"[73] Brody wrote, \"I'm finding it hard not to make fun of the film's highly constructed and narrow-bore array of givens, of plot points and their resolutions.\"[73] Both critics found Lawrence's Oscar-winning performance \"unconvincing\".[71][72] Denby wrote, \"we don't believe [Tiffany] for a second when she says that, in her grief, she 'had sex with everyone in my office'. Lawrence is tough and proud, and always plays strong, and the remark doesn't track with anything we see onscreen.\"[71] Brody finds Lawrence, \"a poised and graceful actress\", who \"has none of the wildness that her character needs—and that lack of wildness is part of the reason for the film's success.\"[73]\n\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote that there's a \"tiring fruitlessness to the mayhem\", describing the lead character as a \"rambling headcase\", though noting Lawrence as the film's \"only 'silver lining'\".[74] The Globe and Mail's chief film critic, Liam Lacey, gave 3 out of four stars, but wrote \"you can easily see Silver Linings Playbook as a better-acted version of any number of Sundance-style films about quirky outsiders who find a common bond.\"[75]\n\nThe NFL was critical of the gambling in the film and declined to broadcast an interview with Bradley Cooper and Chris Tucker during Thanksgiving.[76]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, Silver Linings Playbook received eight nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director for Russell, Best Actor for Cooper, Best Actress for Lawrence, Best Supporting Actor for De Niro and Best Supporting Actress for Weaver, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing, with Lawrence winning the film its only Academy Award, becoming the second-youngest winner in the Best Actress category, only behind Marlee Matlin in Children of a Lesser God (1986). It became the first film since Reds (1981) to be Oscar-nominated for the four acting categories and the first since Million Dollar Baby (2004) to be nominated for the Big Five Oscars,[77]\n\n### Top ten lists\n\n- Cinemablend listed the film at number 8 on its list of the year's 10 best.[78]\n- Critic Catherine Shoard of The Guardian listed the film at number 4 on her list of the year's 10 best.[79]\n\n## Musical adaptation\n\nIt was announced on October 5, 2021 that the movie will be developed into a stage musical for Broadway.[80]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Silver Linings Playbook\".

The film raises interesting questions about the nature of addiction, whether one can be faulted for behaviors driven by addiction, what the source of addiction might be, and what it means really to break free from an addiction. At various points, Renton ruminates on the mindset of junkies, and how the only thing they think about is their next hit—he even describes it as freeing. We find him committing various crimes or harming those around him because of his addiction, but we are also shown images that help us understand the strength of the addiction. We can then understand some of Renton’s behaviors and feel sympathy for him despite his mistakes.\n\nThe movie does not glamorize drug use at all; a major part of this theme is the depths to which addicts will sink and the terrible living conditions they will endure as long as remain addicted. Tied to this theme is the way that addiction also affects those around the addicts; we see an innocent infant die of neglect because of her mother's addiction. Tommy, who is not a heroin user at the start of the movie, is also harmed by the addictions of his friends—their promotion of heroin draws him to the drug. Additionally, his character helps us to understand how one might start an addiction: struggling with a low point in his life, Tommy decides to try heroin, and his addiction becomes a vicious cycle. The film achieves a complex and nuanced take on drug addiction, offering several ways of looking at it, so that the audience can understand it better.\n\n## Friendship\n\nThe function of friendship, what it means, and what its harms and benefits might be, are central to the film. It is often implied that Renton’s problem, more than his drug addiction, is his friendship with the wrong people. His friends use him and each other for their own means, and seem not to care about one another’s well-being. All of Renton’s friendships are toxic in some way: Sick Boy and Begbie are incredibly negative influences on Renton, and Spud and Tommy are victims of Renton’s selfishness. Despite the clear problems in their friendships, Renton and his friends rarely do anything to try to change their friends or escape their influence; this is summed up by the oft-repeated line about Begbie, “he’s a mate, so what can you do?” Renton and his friends seem to have some idea of friendship as something they forged a long time ago, and which should not be broken even if the friendship is nothing but trouble. Renton finally begins to improve toward the end of the film when he makes this realization—he needs to escape his friends, and so he moves to London. Though they catch up to him again, he finally resolves to flee them forever, and commits one final trespass against them that will end their friendship permanently. He does seem to appreciate Spud at the end and leave money for him, indicating that he has come to understand that Spud was unique in never having hurt him, which is an important part of friendship.\n\n## Causes and outcomes of criminality\n\nRenton and his friends repeatedly commit crimes throughout the film, and the various motivations and outcomes of their crimes draw a distinction between violent crimes and theft driven by addiction. The film also raises many questions about the nature of criminality, whether one can be blamed entirely for crimes committed for addiction, and whether certain displays, like remorse, mitigate one’s criminality. This is brought to a head at the shoplifting trial, when the judge proclaims that addiction explains, but does not excuse, Renton and Spud’s actions. In this same trial, however, the judge deems Spud’s criminality worse because he fails to show remorse, while Renton fakes remorse to avoid a sentence. This raises questions about the role of appearances in the justice system—how is it that Spud is deemed more of a criminal, when it is clear to the audience that Renton is worse?\n\nAdditionally, we see an increase in Sick Boy’s criminality following a tragedy (the death of his daughter), which indicates that the driving force behind criminality might be trauma in some cases. Another comparison is drawn between Renton and Begbie: Renton’s crimes are driven by his addiction to a substance, while Begbie is criminal because of his love for violence and aggression. Though Renton’s crimes may not be “victimless,” it is clear to the audience that they are not as directly harmful to people as the violent assaults that Begbie regularly commits. Still, Renton is often viewed as more criminal than Begbie (until the bank robbery) for things like shoplifting—society, as represented by the judge and the nurse, view him as criminal or low, and he is actually arrested while Begbie suffers new consequences for his many assaults. This implies that addiction itself is considered criminal, and that criminality is derived from society’s prejudices.\n\n## Waste and decay\n\nIn the film, drug use is shown to cause waste and biological decay. This connection is made throughout the film by imagery—we see this perhaps most clearly in the “worst toilet in Scotland” scene and when Renton visits Tommy, who has contracted HIV. Human feces is often used to symbolize such decay, and toward the end of the film, blood and HIV are also used to show the bodily corruption that heroin can cause. This theme is one that offers a poignant criticism of heroin use, despite the claim by some critics that Trainspotting glorifies drugs: drug use corrupts your body and brings on illness and death.\n\n## Reality and perception\n\nThis theme is primarily conveyed by the director’s stylistic choices. Much of the photography reflects documentary styles, like tracking shots, while the content plays with surrealism. We get the sense that the film’s images are intended to portray honestly Renton’s understanding of the world, but that understanding is often marred by a skewed perception of reality. We are shown incredible detail, which conveys a graphic realism and obvious surrealism in immediate succession; in the overdose scene, for example, the close of up the inside of the needle realistically portrays the way that an injection works, in detail and from an angle that Renton could never possibly have seen; this realistic scene is immediately followed by a surreal daydream in which he imagines falling through the floor in Swanney’s apartment.\n\nThis theme extends to societal perceptions and the way such perceptions can be at odds with reality. We see in Renton’s encounters with people outside of his friend group (the judge, the nurse) that society has a perception of Renton because of his drug habit that causes them to judge him in a certain way. The viewer, however, has seen enough of his reality to develop a better understanding of his actions, and see how these perceptions can be misguided. Further, Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland where the film is set, is widely considered to be a cultural hot-spot and a city that appreciates beauty and the arts. This perception is cleverly juxtaposed with the seedy, criminal world of film's main characters—their reality is not often considered by most people’s perceptions.\n\n## Materialism\n\nBoyle uses materialism to connect scenes together, and to connect the “normal” world with the drug-fueled world of Renton and his friends. Renton criticizes materialism in his opening monologue, mocking it as an idiotic, pathetic, and perhaps corrupting aspect of society. We see an illustration of this criticism when Renton's friend Gav tells him to quit heroin, and then immediately tries to sell him a pressure cooker. But while Renton may shun the material comforts on which most of society depends, he is not without his material obsessions: his simply focus on drugs and drug paraphernalia. The similarity between his materialism and the materialism of the mainstream world is highlighted by the same manner in which he lists both sets of materials, first in the “choose life” monologue (mainstream materiality) and then in the “full time business” monologue (an addict’s materiality). Further, Boyle uses close-up shots of material goods to transition between scenes, focusing first on the material object that will be central to a given scene; when Renton is sober, these are traditional consumer items (like the milkshake he shares with Spud), and when he is on drugs, these are drug-related items (like the suppositories in his hand at Mikey Forrester’s). His fixation on drugs and paraphernalia when he is addicted is no different from the type of consumerist addiction that he mocks in society. This can be seen simultaneously as an example of Renton’s flawed thinking and hypocrisy, as well as a cutting criticism of society’s addiction to materialism.\n\n## Rebellion\n\nRenton’s opening monologue, where he criticizes widespread materialism, sums up the rebellious attitude of his generation, and the way they desired a rejection of the “rat race” lifestyle that was idealized by society. Such a criticism of the older generation’s way of doing things was not out of the ordinary at the time, and has been a clear part of youth culture since the 1960s. In this way, Renton’s opening monologue is not quite as clever or original as his character seems to think it is—this is driven home at the end of the film, when Renton has matured and seems to have completely reversed his opinion on the matter, embracing the things that he criticized at the start of the film. Additionally, for much of the film, many of his actions are driven, not by a genuine desire to do things differently from mainstream society, but a simple reactiveness: his addiction seems partly driven by a rebellion against society, his antisocial behavior is a rebellion against certain types of people (the skinhead he and Sick Boy mess with in the park), and certain decisions are driven by a desire to rebel against his friends’ desires or expectations (he shoots up on the bus just to mess with Begbie).\n\n##### How To Cite https://www.gradesaver.com/trainspotting-film/study-guide/themes in MLA Format\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Study Guide Navigation\n- About Trainspotting (Film)\n- Trainspotting (Film) Summary\n- Character List\n- Cast List\n- Director's Influence\n- Glossary\n- Themes\n- Quotes and Analysis\n- Summary And Analysis\n    - Scene 1 (\"Choose Life\") - Scene 6 (Suppositories)\n    - Scene 7 (\"no longer constipated\") - Scene 16 (\"Begbie did people\")\n    - Scene 17 (\"something important missing\") - Scene 26 (Edinburgh festival)\n    - Scene 27 (\"the good times couldn't last forever\") - Scene 34 (nightmare withdrawal sequence)\n    - Scene 35 (HIV test) - 49 (getting rid of Begbie and Sick Boy)\n    - Scene 50 (Tommy's funeral) - Scene 59 (\"I'm gonna be just like you\")\n- Symbols, Allegory and Motifs\n- Irony\n- Imagery\n- The iconic soundtrack\n- Literary Elements\n- Related Links\n- Essay Questions\n- Quizzes - Test Yourself!\n    - Quiz 1\n    - Quiz 2\n    - Quiz 3\n    - Quiz 4\n- Citations\n- Related Content\n- Study Guide\n- Essays\n- Q &amp;amp; A\n- Danny Boyle Biography\n\n#### Trainspotting (Film) Questions and Answers\n\nThe Question and Answer section for Trainspotting (Film) is a great\nresource to ask questions, find answers, and discuss the novel.\n\n### Study Guide for Trainspotting (Film)\n\nTrainspotting (Film) study guide contains a biography of Danny Boyle, literature essays, quiz questions, major themes, characters, and a full summary and analysis.\n\n- About Trainspotting (Film)\n- Trainspotting (Film) Summary\n- Character List\n- Cast List\n- Director's Influence\n\n### Essays for Trainspotting (Film)\n\nTrainspotting (Film) essays are academic essays for citation.

And that is something you don’t often associate with movies. What is it for a film to have texture? For me, it is when you are so immersed in the film that you can almost reach in and touch, feel, and breathe the world the characters inhabit. A breeze of fresh air in the film hits you; the environment, lush green or urban grey, invites you to walk in its world. A lot of things need to come into place to achieve this. And most films that do, place this atmosphere at the forefront, often ignoring a conventional plot for something more abstract. Aftersun doesn’t do this, however. The beating heart of this film is what it has to say and not how it says it. And yet, the way it conveys its simple and human story taps into something primal within us; it taps into the ever-shifting and fleeting nature of memories.\n\nMemories: Portrayed in these posters through video glitches and a photograph’s fold creases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost of the film takes place in a hotel in Turkey. Calum (Paul Mescal) and his 11-year-old daughter Sophie (Frankie Coro) are on vacation, and present-day adult Sophie recollects the trip through scrappy old footage taken on her camcorder. Whilst these clips portray reality in its honest form, the rest of the film, told through young Sophie’s POV, is bustling with colours and has a haze-like dreamy quality. Yes, these events were probably what exactly happened. But you can’t help but feel that these memories have been slightly altered, with Calum depicted as what she thought he was like, and not who he actually was. Memories change over time, after all. We tend to fill in the gaps and overwrite details. This brings me back to the ‘texture’ of the film. The colour palette is milky, soft, and saturated, making the film feel like a warm hug. The camera’s subjects are often decentralised, fragmented, and off-kilter. Calum and Sophie are given space to exist. The camera lingers on them, letting them soak in the silence, with only the sound of the ambience and their own breaths to accompany them. The entire film could’ve been composed of these moments and I still would’ve deeply enjoyed it. However, these small moments turn out to have a huge impact on the understanding of the film. It is only in the movie's later stages that you realise what it’s actually about and all the little things end up foreshadowing what will happen.\n\nCalum, portrayed brilliantly by Paul Mescal (snubbed by the Oscars), is a man battling his personal demons. Beneath his pleasant visage and gentle smile, he is in agony. And he does his best to shield his daughter from that. In a scene where he removes the cast from his broken arm, there is a visual separation between him and his daughter. Sophie, in the living room illuminated with warm light by a lamp, and Calum, in the cold and dimly lit bathroom, on the verge of crying because of the pain. But he doesn’t; to not cause his daughter to panic. This is a perfect representation of their relationship. Calum tries to do his best to make the trip a memorable one for Sophie, and the duo definitely has fun. But there are moments where cracks show in Calum’s delightful facade. When his daughter tells him about how exhausted and down she feels, he feels ashamed and disgusted. Mescal, brushing his teeth, depicts these emotions with a silent rage simmering underneath. He spits his toothpaste at the mirror, at himself, feeling guilty about the depressive episodes that he might have passed on to his daughter.\n\nCalum’s best efforts to prevent his daughter from getting exposed to his anguish — visualised\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese small moments all add up and explode in a crescendo towards the film’s oh-so-brilliant climax, elevating the film from a great one to a masterpiece that should/will be remembered for generations to come. Queen and David Bowie’s Under Pressure will forever be ingrained in my mind, and I’ll never be able to listen to it again without tearing up. The poetic ending is similar to that of another all-time favourite, Clare Denis’ magnum opus Beau Travail (1999).\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Hauntology\n\nCinema is inherently a ghostly medium. It manages to evoke worlds in a different space and time. The characters in a film are ghosts, in a way. They don’t really exist; they are different from the actors that portray them. And yet we always feel their presence, out of reach. One might say cinema is the most accurate reflection of reality since it utilizes visuals, dialogue, and sound to document entities, human and not. But ever since the inception of the relatively young art form, creative filmmakers have sought to push that envelope and started to convey something more abstract. Faith, memories, love, and grief were meditated upon. Whilst these themes are mostly explored through metaphors where certain characters, objects, or actions are supposed to represent something, some filmmakers tapped into this intrinsic haunted nature of movies and had a looming spectral aesthetic to their films. ‘Hauntology’ is a word used to describe such films, although it wasn’t invented as such. A portmanteau of ‘haunting’ and ‘ontology’, we can thank Jacques Derrida (of deconstructionism fame) for coining the term. But the term is often associated with a sub-genre of electronic music starting from the 2000s. Music artists like Burial and Boards of Canada incorporated a decayed and spectral quality to their sound to invoke a sense of nostalgia. Nostalgia for a time that perhaps never existed.\n\nBut when it comes to film, Alan Resnais’ Last Year At Marienbad (1961) is probably the best example. With its ever-shifting sense of time, location, and logic, it defies convention and all attempts to rationalise the film. Structured like a recurring dream, the film attempts to capture the complexity of memories and thoughts. It could even be a memory of a dream.\n\nAnd then there’s Andrei Tarkovsky, whose entire filmography is tinged with the melancholic and aching sense of longing that is synonymous with hauntology. With atmospheres so thick that you can cut it with a knife, his films sometimes feature literal spectres, as in Solaris.\n\nThe surreal Last Year At Marienbad: The trees do not cast shadows on an overcast day, while the people do. They were painted on.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aftersun: Haunted By The Living\n\nAftersun doesn’t place this aesthetic at its centre unlike the films discussed above. It is a powerful father-daughter drama that uses the fragmented nature of old memories to merely supplement its narrative, not supplant it. But nevertheless, the subtext of haze-like memories hangs all over the film. The posters allude to this fact, and the scrappy old footage scattered throughout the film also aligns with hauntology. But before we go further, we need to talk about what the film is actually about. So spoilers ahead (duh).\n\nIt is clear that Calum is suicidal and ends up killing himself after the events of the film. Numerous moments point towards this. The fact that he is reckless; going diving without a licence, walking carefree in front of a moving bus, standing on the railing of a balcony, and the most obvious hint: Him walking into the ocean at night with his clothes on. Despite having minor money troubles, he decides to buy an expensive rug as a family heirloom for his daughter. At this point, he probably knew that this trip would be his last seeing her. Sophie herself is very perceptive and mature. She loses her goggles while diving and apologises to her father, acknowledging that it was expensive. Throughout the trip, there are some weird traces of tension between them. It isn’t your usual ‘I actually hate you dad mwaaaahh’ kind of conflict. It is Sophie realising that her dad isn’t completely who she thought he was. That he is not invincible and that he, too, is vulnerable to anguish and silent suffering. This is not at all obvious in the first watch. But once you know the context after the incredible ending, we start to piece things together. The tension itself is ghost-like.\n\nOne pivotal point in the film is when Sophie asks her dad about his 11th birthday and films it through the camcorder. We see it through the footage. Calum is distraught and dodges the question, implying a fraught childhood. He gets irked and asks her to stop recording. When this recording of the ‘interview’ is played on the television in their room, Calum makes her turn it off; then, you can see his hazy and distorted reflection on the black screen of the TV. And a small proper reflection on a mirror in the corner.\n\nA masterclass in mise-en-scène\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis might be the most important frame in the movie (The ending gains its strength as a whole sequence). The blurred line between reality and memory is perfectly captured here. It is here that we realise that these scenes are recollections from adult Sophie. Calum’s image is not clearly visible, just like how her memories of him are mangled. There are quite a few shots like these in the film, with Calum and Sophie visible only through the reflections on objects. Reflection and introspection are major themes in the movie, after all. But the film’s greatest weapon to hammer home its message is the abstract nightclub dance floor.\n\nThe film opens in darkness, and strobe lights join the fray. We are able to make out a face in the rave, a woman’s. We come to know that this is adult Sophie. Initially, she is barely visible, only for fleeting moments. But as the film progresses, these cryptic rave sequences (which are interspersed throughout the film) get more and more clear. We later learn who she is staring at: Her father, the same age he was during the trip. This suggests that this was the last she saw of him. In the surreal rave, Calum is wildly flaying around in a dance. He is clearly uncomfortable. In the resort, alone in his room, Calum sobs uncontrollably. The camera pans to a postcard addressed to Edinburgh for Sophie. He tells her that he’ll always love her. By this point, the viewers will realise this is probably his suicide note.\n\nAnd coming to the mesmerizing ending, Callum takes his daughter to dance on the last night of the trip. This dance in Turkey is juxtaposed with the rave sequence, and a version of Under Pressure plays throughout. Now, both Sophie and Calum are visible, although the lights still violently flicker. She screams at him, desperately trying to hold and stop him from manically dancing. Meanwhile, in the resort, 11-year-old Sophie is embarrassed and tries to push him away. And finally, adult Sophie manages to calm him down and embrace him in the rave. And the young daughter also gives in and hugs her father. The flickering adult Sophie morphs into the younger one, and the sequence ends. Her memories fuse into her current-day recollection of the events. She realises that while her father was joyous on the outside during the dance, inside, he was in a dark room with his senses getting stabbed.\n\nWe see the old footage again; of Sophie leaving Calum at the airport to return to her mother. It is Calum recording this, of course, and the film ends with him closing the camcorder and heading back through the empty hallway into the dark room in the rave sequences. This is the last time Sophie sees him. From then on, he lives only in her memories. As a ghost.\n\nThe ending is pure poetry, and David Bowie’s last lines in Under Pressure sum it up:\n\nThis is our last dance / This is our last dance / This is ourselves\n\nMovies\n\nMovie Review\n\nFilm\n\nFilm Analysis\n\n--\n\n--\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Written by Raamanujan\n\nI have buried myself under a hundred layers of irony\n\n## Responses (6)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\nTeams",

And that is something you don’t often associate with movies. What is it for a film to have texture? For me, it is when you are so immersed in the film that you can almost reach in and touch, feel, and breathe the world the characters inhabit. A breeze of fresh air in the film hits you; the environment, lush green or urban grey, invites you to walk in its world. A lot of things need to come into place to achieve this. And most films that do, place this atmosphere at the forefront, often ignoring a conventional plot for something more abstract. Aftersun doesn’t do this, however. The beating heart of this film is what it has to say and not how it says it. And yet, the way it conveys its simple and human story taps into something primal within us; it taps into the ever-shifting and fleeting nature of memories.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Most of the film takes place in a hotel in Turkey. <character>Calum</character> (<actor>Paul Mescal</actor>) and his 11-year-old daughter <character>Sophie</character> (<actor>Frankie Coro</actor>) are on vacation, and present-day adult Sophie recollects the trip through scrappy old footage taken on her camcorder. Whilst these clips portray reality in its honest form, the rest of the film, told through young Sophie’s POV, is bustling with colours and has a haze-like dreamy quality. Yes, these events were probably what exactly happened. But you can’t help but feel that these memories have been slightly altered, with Calum depicted as what she thought he was like, and not who he actually was. Memories change over time, after all. We tend to fill in the gaps and overwrite details. This brings me back to the ‘texture’ of the film. The colour palette is milky, soft, and saturated, making the film feel like a warm hug. The camera’s subjects are often decentralised, fragmented, and off-kilter. Calum and Sophie are given space to exist. The camera lingers on them, letting them soak in the silence, with only the sound of the ambience and their own breaths to accompany them. The entire film could’ve been composed of these moments and I still would’ve deeply enjoyed it. However, these small moments turn out to have a huge impact on the understanding of the film. It is only in the movie's later stages that you realise what it’s actually about and all the little things end up foreshadowing what will happen.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            Calum, portrayed brilliantly by <actor>Paul Mescal</actor> (snubbed by the Oscars), is a man battling his personal demons. Beneath his pleasant visage and gentle smile, he is in agony. And he does his best to shield his daughter from that. In a scene where he removes the cast from his broken arm, there is a visual separation between him and his daughter. Sophie, in the living room illuminated with warm light by a lamp, and Calum, in the cold and dimly lit bathroom, on the verge of crying because of the pain. But he doesn’t; to not cause his daughter to panic. This is a perfect representation of their relationship. Calum tries to do his best to make the trip a memorable one for Sophie, and the duo definitely has fun. But there are moments where cracks show in Calum’s delightful facade. When his daughter tells him about how exhausted and down she feels, he feels ashamed and disgusted. Mescal, brushing his teeth, depicts these emotions with a silent rage simmering underneath. He spits his toothpaste at the mirror, at himself, feeling guilty about the depressive episodes that he might have passed on to his daughter.\n        </paragraph>\n\n        <paragraph>\n            These small moments all add up and explode in a crescendo towards the film’s oh-so-brilliant climax, elevating the film from a great one to a masterpiece that should/will be remembered for generations to come. Queen and David Bowie’s Under Pressure will forever be ingrained in my mind, and I’ll never be able to listen to it again without tearing up. The poetic ending is similar to that of another all-time favourite, Clare Denis’ magnum opus Beau Travail (1999).\n        </paragraph>\n    </content>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to maintain readability while incorporating the required XML tags based on the attributes defined in the ADT.

The plot follows a young husband and father (Shannon) who is plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, and questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself and his increasing worries over having paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nThe film won two Saturn Awards, Best Writing for Nichols and Best Actor for Shannon, and was nominated for two more, Best Horror or Thriller Film and Best Actress for Chastain. It explores the themes of masculinity, mental illness, and the lengths people go to protect the ones they love.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn LaGrange, Ohio, Curtis LaForche has apocalyptic dreams and visual and auditory hallucinations of rain \"like fresh motor oil,\" swarms of menacing black birds, and being harmed by people close to him. He hides all of this from his wife, Samantha, and their deaf daughter, Hannah.  He instead channels his anxieties into a compulsive obsession to improve and enlarge a storm shelter in his backyard; however, his increasingly strange behavior – including a tendency to cut ties with anyone in his life that has harmed him only in his dreams – strains his relationship with his family, friends, employer, and the close-knit town. He also puts his construction job in jeopardy as he borrows equipment from the company to build his shelter.\n\nTo deal with his increased insomnia and apocalyptic visions, Curtis sees a counselor at a free clinic, with whom he talks about his family's psychological history.  His mother, Sarah, has paranoid schizophrenia that surfaced in her at about the same age that Curtis is now. He's worried that he may also have the disorder.\n\nIn order to have the remodeled storm shelter completed, Curtis gets a home improvement loan he can't afford to start building the shelter – all without telling his wife.  Samantha becomes angry when she discovers the project. After Curtis takes more than the prescribed dose of a sedative and has a seizure, Samantha calls an ambulance.  He recovers, then finally explains the truth to her, including his dreams.\n\nCurtis is increasingly absent from work, causing tension with his boss, as he and Samantha make preparations for the cochlear implant surgery for Hannah in six weeks' time.  Having been informed of the borrowed work equipment, Curtis's boss fires him and gives him only two weeks' worth of medical insurance benefits, after placing Dewart, the close friend and coworker whom Curtis asked to help him start construction of the shelter, on two weeks' unpaid administrative leave.\n\nCurtis buys gas masks for his family and extends his previous employer's health insurance policy for a few extra weeks. After he finds out that his counselor at the free clinic has suddenly transferred and been replaced with a new one, he walks out. Tensions linger between Curtis and Samantha over the loss of his job at such a crucial time for their family. Samantha gets Curtis to see an actual psychiatrist and demands that they attend a social function so she can restore some sense of normalcy to their strained, increasingly isolated life. At a Lions Club community gathering, a bitter Dewart, who has been spreading gossip that Curtis is crazy, is angrily provoked and punches him.  Enraged, Curtis knocks Dewart to the floor, overturns a table, and unleashes a frightening verbal tirade upon everyone present. He prophetically shouts that a devastating storm is coming, insisting that none of them are prepared.\n\nLater, a tornado warning sends him and his family into the shelter. After they awaken, Curtis reluctantly removes his gas mask, prompted by Samantha. They go to open the shelter doors, but he still hears a storm outside. His wife implores him, insisting that there's no storm and that he needs to open the door. After a tense standoff, Curtis throws open the doors into the blinding sun; a strong but bearable storm has passed, and neighbors are cleaning up broken tree limbs and other yard debris as power company trucks restore electricity along the street.\n\nA psychiatrist advises the couple to go through with their planned, annual beach vacation but that Curtis will need to get psychiatric care in a facility away from his family upon their return. At Myrtle Beach, while Curtis is building sandcastles with Hannah, she signs the word \"storm.” As Samantha exits their beach house, the thick, oily rain that Curtis spoke of begins to fall, staining her outstretched hand. Samantha looks up to a bigger version of the ominous storm clouds Curtis had seen, massing over the ocean; multiple waterspouts reach down to the ocean's surface, and the tide pulls back as a tsunami looms in the distance. Samantha and Curtis exchange glances as Samantha whispers \"okay.”\n\n## Cast\n\n- Michael Shannon as Curtis LaForche\n- Jessica Chastain as Samantha \"Sam\" LaForche\n- Shea Whigham as Dewart\n- Katy Mixon as Nat\n- Ray McKinnon as Kyle\n- Lisa Gay Hamilton as Kendra\n- Robert Longstreet as Jim\n- Kathy Baker as Sarah\n\n## Release\n\nTake Shelter premiered in January 2011 at the Sundance Film Festival, and Sony Pictures Classics acquired rights to distribute the film in North America, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand.[3] The film also screened in May 2011 at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the 50th Critics' Week Grand Prix.[4] It also received the Fipresci award from the International Federation of Film Critics, sharing it with Le Havre and The Minister.[5] In September 2011, Take Shelter was shown at the 37th Deauville American Film Festival, where it beat 13 other contenders to win the festival's grand prize.[6] Later in September, Take Shelter was shown at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival[7][8] and at the 7th Zurich Film Festival, where it was named Best International Feature Film.[9][10]\n\nThe film had a limited release in New York and Los Angeles on September 30, 2011.[11]\n\n## Reception\n\nTake Shelter received critical acclaim. It has a rating of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 168 reviews, with an average score of 8/10. The consensus states \"Michael Shannon gives a powerhouse performance and the purposefully subtle filmmaking creates a perfect blend of drama, terror, and dread.\"[12] The film also has a score of 85 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 34 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[13]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised Shannon's performance, writing, \"It is the gift of actor Michael Shannon as Curtis LaForche that while appearing to be a stable husband and father with a good job in construction, he also can evoke by his eyes and manner a deep unease.\" He also wrote, \"Here is a frightening thriller based not on special effects gimmicks but on a dread that seems quietly spreading in the land: that the good days are ending, and climate changes or other sinister forces will sweep away our safety.\"[14]\n\n## Analysis\n\nSince the release of Take Shelter, viewers have discussed the meaning of the film's ambiguous ending. In an interview with Creative Screenwriting five years after the release of the film, Nichols reflected, \"I had a very strict idea of what the end of Take Shelter was. I know exactly what happens, and it’s fascinating to see people respond to it in their own ways. The beautiful part of storytelling is that you’re not just telling people a story, they’re also telling you something about themselves too through their reactions. In that situation you’re in a conversation with your audience. I really can’t think of a more rewarding or fulfilling result for something you’ve written. It’s active, kinetic, and really humbling.\"[15]\n\nIn a video interview with Chase Whale in September 2012, Nichols elaborated on the ending, saying \"For me personally...the moment that matters, dream, not dream, real, not real, whatever it is...is these two characters looking at each other and connecting.  The fact that they're both seeing it, that's what matters, because if this is a film that is a meditation on marriage and commitment and communication then what the ending has to be is that these people are on the same page again.  They had this wedge put in between them from all of these various factors, and now at the end they're looking at each other, and they are seeing each other, and they're together, and the circumstances that surround that, please, open to interpretation.\"[16]\n\n## See also\n\n- List of films featuring the deaf and hard of hearing\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Take Shelter (15)\".

At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies.\n\nTen years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fiancé, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on.\n\nSometime later, at a party for Anna's mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband.\n\nThat night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms.\n\nSean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning.\n\nAnna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt.\n\nWhen Anna misses an appointment with her fiancé to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips.\n\nAnna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused.\n\nWhen Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean's edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Nicole Kidman as Anna\n- Cameron Bright as young Sean\n- Danny Huston as Joseph\n- Lauren Bacall as Eleanor\n- Alison Elliott as Laura\n- Arliss Howard as Bob\n- Michael Desautels as adult Sean\n- Anne Heche as Clara\n- Peter Stormare as Clifford\n- Ted Levine as Mr. Conte\n- Cara Seymour as Mrs. Conte\n- Novella Nelson as Lee\n- Zoe Caldwell as Mrs. Hill\n- Charles Goff as Mr. Drummond\n- Sheila Smith as Mrs. Drummond\n- Milo Addica as Jimmy\n- Libby Skala as a bridesmaid\n\n## Production\n\nDirector Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about \"the idea of eternal love\" and a \"mystery of the heart\".[1] While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a \"paranormal piece\".[2] He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on.[3] The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: \"There's this little kid and he tells a woman he's her dead husband – and he's ten years old.\"[4] Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière at his producer's recommendation. Carrière ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant.[4] The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story.[4] With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead.[4] \"We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,\" said Glazer. \"I'm not a Buddhist and I don't believe in reincarnation; I don't think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.\"[5]\n\nActress Nicole Kidman read the screenplay and wanted to do the film when she found out that Glazer was directing, as she loved his previous film, Sexy Beast.[6] She approached the director about doing the film. At first, he resisted because he felt that \"her celebrity is so everywhere that I thought it could only hurt the delicate nature of this character\".[1] However, he met with Kidman and realized that \"she was ready to inhabit the role\".[1] The more he talked to Kidman about her character, he would rewrite the script on weekends, tailoring it specifically for her.[3] To show Anna in mourning both externally and internally, Glazer gave her short hair, spare wardrobe, and short, clipped speech.[6] The director explained Anna's appearance as \"somebody who had sort of let all glamor go and sexuality go\".[7] Kidman said that Glazer instructed her to do small, personal reactions. She found the character to be all-consuming so she could not separate herself from the role. To research for the role, Kidman spoke to two friends who had lost their fathers and they talked about how it still affected them years after.[6]\n\nAddica and Glazer often wrote scenes the day before they were shot, giving them to the actors on the actual day they were shooting.[4]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nBirth grossed $5.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $18.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $23.9 million.[8] In the United States and Canada, the film opened at number 12 on its opening weekend, grossing $1.3 million from 550 theaters.[9]\n\n### Critical response\n\nBirth premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival where its first press screening was greeted with widely reported booing[10] and catcalls.[1] Glazer responded, \"People are a bit polarised by it, which is healthy\".[1]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A well-mounted production is undermined by a muddled, absurd storyline of questionable taste.\"[11] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[12]\n\nIn his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, \"the script is hooey. Birth is ridiculous, and oddly unforgettable\".[13] Michael O'Sullivan, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \"What I'm not so fond of is the cop-out ultimately taken by the filmmakers, who can't seem to follow through on their promisingly metaphysical premise (let alone the theme of obsessive love), electing instead to eliminate all ambiguity\".[14] In his review for the New York Daily News, Jack Mathews called the film, \"corny, plodding, implausible and – on occasion – seriously creepy\".[15]\n\nHowever, Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and compared it to Rosemary's Baby saying, \"Birth is less sensational and more ominous, and also more intriguing because instead of going for quick thrills, it explores what might really happen if a 10-year-old turned up and said what Sean says\".[16] In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott praised Nicole Kidman's performance: \"Without Ms. Kidman's brilliantly nuanced performance, Birth might feel arch, chilly and a little sadistic, but she gives herself so completely to the role that the film becomes both spellbinding and heartbreaking, a delicate chamber piece with the large, troubled heart of an opera.\"[17] Birth was placed at 96 on Slant Magazine's best films of the 2000s.[18] Writing in The Guardian in August 2010, film critic David Thomson included the film in his list of \"10 lost works of genius\".[19]\n\nWhile the film divided critics and audiences mostly \"stayed away\" upon release, the reception of the film has been reassessed over the years,[20] with some publications calling it a masterpiece[21][22] and Kidman's performance recognized as one of the best of her career.[20]\n\n### Controversy\n\nThe film generated controversy due to a scene wherein Kidman's character shares a bath with Bright's character, both apparently naked.[1] In fact, Bright was never naked and the two were never even in the same room during the filming of the bath scene apart from one camera shot, and when this shot happened both wore special clothes that were not visible to the camera.[23] Glazer insists that the scene is not erotic or exploitative. \"I can imagine that, before people see it, they might think it was salacious. But I knew it was never going to be that.\"[1]\n\nAt a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Kidman addressed the controversy of her character kissing a boy: \"It wasn't that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy. I wanted to make a film where you understand love.\"[24] Further controversy occurred at the festival when a journalist described Kidman as a \"screen legend\", to which her co-star Lauren Bacall replied, \"She is a beginner\".[24] Kidman downplayed Bacall's remarks and said, \"I certainly don't feel like a big star in Hollywood\".[24]\n\nComplaints of the film's \"cop-out\" ending are questioned by Roger Ebert in his review, who notes: \"There seem to be two possible explanations for what finally happens, but neither one is consistent with all of the facts.\"[16]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                       | Category                                                             | Subject           | Result    |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| 61st Venice International Film Festival     | Golden Lion                                                          | Birth             | Nominated |\n| Golden Globe Awards                         | Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama                             | Nicole Kidman     | Nominated |\n| Critics' Choice Awards                      | Best Young Performer                                                 | Cameron Bright    | Nominated |\n| Saturn Awards                               | Best Fantasy Film                                                    | Birth             | Nominated |\n| Saturn Awards                               | Best Actress                                                         | Nicole Kidman     | Nominated |\n| Saturn Awards                               | Best Performance by a Younger Actor                                  | Cameron Bright    | Nominated |\n| Gold Derby Awards                           | Best Original Score                                                  | Alexandre Desplat | Nominated |\n| International Cinephile Society Awards      | Best Original Score                                                  | Alexandre Desplat | Won       |\n| International Cinephile Society Awards      | Best Picture                                                         | Birth             | Nominated |\n| International Cinephile Society Awards      | Best Actress                                                         | Nicole Kidman     | Nominated |\n| International Cinephile Society Awards      | Best Cinematography                                                  | Harris Savides    | Nominated |\n| London Film Critics' Circle Awards          | Actress of the Year                                                  | Nicole Kidman     | Nominated |\n| Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards | Best Original Score                                                  | Alexandre Desplat | Nominated |\n| Maria Awards                                | Best Film                                                            | Birth             | Nominated |\n| Maria Awards                                | Citizen Kane Award for Best Directorial Revelation – Special Mention | Jonathan Glazer   | Won       |\n| Online Film Critics Society Awards          | Best Original Score                                                  | Alexandre Desplat | Nominated |\n| Young Artist Awards                         | Best Performance in a Feature Film – Supporting Young Actor          | Cameron Bright    | Nominated |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f g Johnston, Sheila (October 29, 2004). \"Giving Birth to a Scandal\".

At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies.\n\n            Ten years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fiancé, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on.\n\n            Sometime later, at a party for Anna's mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband.\n\n            That night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms.\n\n            Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning.\n\n            Anna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt.\n\n            When Anna misses an appointment with her fiancé to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips.\n\n            Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused.\n\n            When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean's edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.\n        </Plot>\n        <Cast>\n            - Nicole Kidman as Anna\n            - Cameron Bright as young Sean\n            - Danny Huston as Joseph\n            - Lauren Bacall as Eleanor\n            - Alison Elliott as Laura\n            - Arliss Howard as Bob\n            - Michael Desautels as adult Sean\n            - Anne Heche as Clara\n            - Peter Stormare as Clifford\n            - Ted Levine as Mr. Conte\n            - Cara Seymour as Mrs. Conte\n            - Novella Nelson as Lee\n            - Zoe Caldwell as Mrs. Hill\n            - Charles Goff as Mr. Drummond\n            - Sheila Smith as Mrs. Drummond\n            - Milo Addica as Jimmy\n            - Libby Skala as a bridesmaid\n        </Cast>\n        <Production>\n            Director Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about \"the idea of eternal love\" and a \"mystery of the heart\". While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a \"paranormal piece\". He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on. The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: \"There's this little kid and he tells a woman he's her dead husband – and he's ten years old.\" Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière at his producer's recommendation. Carrière ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant. The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story. With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead. \"We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,\" said Glazer. \"I'm not a Buddhist and I don't believe in reincarnation; I don't think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.\"\n        </Production>\n        <Reception>\n            Birth grossed $5.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $18.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $23.9 million. In the United States and Canada, the film opened at number 12 on its opening weekend, grossing $1.3 million from 550 theaters.\n\n            Birth premiered at the 61st Venice International Film Festival where its first press screening was greeted with widely reported booing and catcalls. Glazer responded, \"People are a bit polarised by it, which is healthy\".\n\n            On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A well-mounted production is undermined by a muddled, absurd storyline of questionable taste.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 51 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\n\n            In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, \"the script is hooey. Birth is ridiculous, and oddly unforgettable\". Michael O'Sullivan, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \"What I'm not so fond of is the cop-out ultimately taken by the filmmakers, who can't seem to follow through on their promisingly metaphysical premise (let alone the theme of obsessive love), electing instead to eliminate all ambiguity\". In his review for the New York Daily News, Jack Mathews called the film, \"corny, plodding, implausible and – on occasion – seriously creepy\".\n\n            However, Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and compared it to Rosemary's Baby saying, \"Birth is less sensational and more ominous, and also more intriguing because instead of going for quick thrills, it explores what might really happen if a 10-year-old turned up and said what Sean says\". In his review for the New York Times, A. O. Scott praised Nicole Kidman's performance: \"Without Ms. Kidman's brilliantly nuanced performance, Birth might feel arch, chilly and a little sadistic, but she gives herself so completely to the role that the film becomes both spellbinding and heartbreaking, a delicate chamber piece with the large, troubled heart of an opera.\" Birth was placed at 96 on Slant Magazine's best films of the 2000s. Writing in The Guardian in August 2010, film critic David Thomson included the film in his list of \"10 lost works of genius\".\n\n            While the film divided critics and audiences mostly \"stayed away\" upon release, the reception of the film has been reassessed over the years, with some publications calling it a masterpiece and Kidman's performance recognized as one of the best of her career.\n        </Reception>\n    </AdditionalInformation>\n</ReformattedArticle>\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes in the ADT.",

                    "Plot": "Sean and Anna are a married couple living in New York City. At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies. Ten years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fiancé, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on. Sometime later, at a party for Anna's mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband. That night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms. Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning. Anna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt. When Anna misses an appointment with her fiancé to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips. Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused. When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean's edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.",

                    "Production": "Director Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about 'the idea of eternal love' and a 'mystery of the heart'. While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a 'paranormal piece'. He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on. The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: 'There's this little kid and he tells a woman he's her dead husband – and he's ten years old.' Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière at his producer's recommendation. Carrière ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant. The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story. With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead. 'We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,' said Glazer. 'I'm not a Buddhist and I don't believe in reincarnation; I don't think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.'"

Starring Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy, Elisabeth Moss, Jared Leto, Angela Bettis, Jeffrey Tambor, Vanessa Redgrave, and Whoopi Goldberg, the film follows a young woman who spends 18 months institutionalized at a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt.\n\nGirl, Interrupted was theatrically released in the United States on December 21, 1999, and grossed $48 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews, but Ryder, Jolie and Murphy were praised; Jolie won numerous awards including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1967, New England, aimless eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen has a nervous breakdown and overdoses on aspirin and alcohol. Against her wishes, she is checked into Claymoore, a local psychiatric hospital. In the psychiatric ward, Susanna befriends Polly \"Torch\" Clark, a childlike girl with schizophrenia; Cynthia Crowley; Daisy Randone, who self-harms and has obsessive–compulsive disorder; Georgina Tuskin, a pathological liar and Susanna's roommate; and Janet Webber, a sardonic woman with anorexia. Susanna is particularly drawn to the sociopath Lisa Rowe, who is rebellious but charismatic and encourages Susanna to stop taking her medication and resist therapy.\n\nLisa helps the girls sneak around at night in the hospital's underground tunnels and continuously provokes them and the staff, including the stern head nurse, Valerie Owens. Through regular therapy sessions with Dr. Melvin Potts, Susanna learns she has borderline personality disorder, a fact Dr. Potts initially conceals from her. On a rare supervised group outing celebrating Daisy's impending release, the women visit an ice cream parlor. Susanna is confronted by Barbara Gilcrest, the wife of an English instructor with whom she had an affair, and their daughter, Bonnie. Barbara publicly chastises Susanna for sleeping with her husband; coming to Susanna's defense, Lisa insultingly berates Barbara and the other girls mock her and Bonnie before they both leave, humiliated. This endears Lisa to Susanna even more, though Valerie reprimands Lisa.\n\nIn addition to her affair with Dr. Gilcrest, Susanna has a casual relationship with Toby, a young man who has been drafted to serve in the Vietnam War. He visits Susanna, and begs her to run away with him to Canada. Susanna declines, citing her friendship with the other patients. The same night, Polly has a breakdown and is placed in isolation. Susanna and Lisa drug the night watch nurse with a sedative and attempt to comfort Polly by singing to her. Susanna also makes out with John, one of the hospital orderlies who has a crush on her. When Valerie finds the group sleeping in the hallway in the morning, she punishes the two women, particularly Lisa, who is subjected to electroshock treatment followed by solitary confinement.\n\nLater that night, Lisa manages to break out of confinement and convinces Susanna to escape with her. The women hitchhike to Daisy's newly-rented apartment, supplied by her doting father, and bribe her with Valium to spend the night. Daisy, insistent she has been cured of her illness, is confronted by Lisa when she discovers Daisy has been cutting herself. Lisa taunts and mocks Daisy, accusing her of enjoying the incestuous sexual abuse she has long suffered from her father. The next morning, Susanna finds Daisy dead in her bathroom, having slashed her wrists and hanged herself. Susanna is appalled when Lisa searches Daisy's room and body for cash. Realizing she does not want to become like Lisa, Susanna phones for an ambulance, takes Daisy's kitten and returns to Claymoore while Lisa flees to Florida.\n\nUpon returning to the hospital, Susanna occupies herself with painting and writing, and cooperates with her therapy, including regular sessions with the hospital's head psychologist, Dr. Sonia Wick. Before Susanna is released, Lisa is apprehended and returned to Claymoore. She steals Susanna's diary one night and reads some of the entries to Georgina and Polly in the tunnels, attempting to turn them against Susanna. After reading an entry in which Susanna feels sympathy for Lisa being a cold, dark person, Lisa attacks Susanna and chases her through the tunnels. A furious Susanna confronts Lisa, loudly accusing her of being dead inside and berating her for her abusive behaviors, becoming mentally and emotionally dependent on Claymoore, for being afraid of the world, and for being uncaringly unempathetic. Lisa finally breaks down and contemplates suicide, though Georgina manages to dissuade her. Before Susanna is released the next day, she goes to visit Lisa, now in solitary confinement and restrained to a bed. The two reconcile, and Lisa insists she is not actually heartless. They part on good terms and Susanna bids farewell to everyone, apologizing to Georgina and Polly for what was written about them in her journal, with both women accepting the apology before Susanna departs.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen, the protagonist. Kaysen was 18 years old when diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.\n- Angelina Jolie as Lisa Rowe, diagnosed as a sociopath. Charismatic, manipulative, rebellious and abusive, she has been in the institution since she was twelve, and has escaped several times over her eight years there, but is always caught and brought back eventually. She is looked up to by the other patients and forms a close bond with Susanna.\n- Clea DuVall as Georgina Tuskin, a pathological liar. She is Susanna's seventeen-year-old roommate and her closest friend next to Lisa in the institution. Susanna confides in her about life and Georgina informs Susanna about the other girls there.\n- Brittany Murphy as Daisy Randone, a sexually abused eighteen-year-old girl with OCD who self-harms and is addicted to laxatives. She keeps and hides the carcasses of the cooked chicken that her father brings her in her room.\n- Elisabeth Moss as Polly \"Torch\" Clark, a burn victim who suffers from schizophrenia. She is sixteen years old and is very childlike and easily upset. Georgina informs Susanna that Polly was admitted to Claymoore after her parents told her that she would have to give up her puppy because of her allergies to it, and in response she poured gasoline on the affected area and set it alight, leaving her face horribly scarred. It is later revealed in Polly's file that she was the victim of a house fire.\n- Jared Leto as Tobias Jacobs, Susanna's ex-boyfriend who plans to escape to Canada after being drafted into the military.\n- Jeffrey Tambor as Dr. Melvin Potts\n- Travis Fine as John, an orderly who is smitten with Susanna.

She claims that she is a sociopath like Lisa, but Lisa denies the claim and states that she is a \"dyke\". She is twenty-two and is easily amused.\n- Angela Bettis as Janet Webber, an anorexic. Like Lisa, she is abrasive and seemingly aloof, but is also easily irritated or upset. She is twenty years old.\n- Vanessa Redgrave as Dr. Sonia Wick, the head psychologist of the hospital.\n- Whoopi Goldberg as Valerie Owens, the stern but caring head nurse who oversees the hospital.\n- Bruce Altman as Professor Gilchrest\n- Mary Kay Place as Mrs. Gilchrest\n\nIn addition, Ray Baker portrays Carl Kaysen, Susanna's father, while Joanna Kerns portrays Annette, Susanna's mother.\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nIn June 1993, Columbia Pictures fought off a number of other studios to buy the film rights to Susanna Kaysen's memoir.[3] Winona Ryder, who had also attempted to buy the film rights, ultimately partnered with producer Douglas Wick to develop the project as a star vehicle. The film was then stuck in development hell for five years, with three different scripts written but none satisfying Ryder and Wick, their reasoning being that Kaysen's book struggled to translate to film. Ryder approached James Mangold to direct, after seeing his film debut Heavy.[4] Ryder, Wick and Mangold settled on a final shooting script in mid-1998, with Columbia pushing back production on the film until early 1999 for Ryder to shoot their horror film Lost Souls.[5]\n\n### Casting\n\nBecause of the volume of strong female characters in the film, a number of young actresses sought parts in it. Reese Witherspoon, Christina Ricci, Katie Holmes, Gretchen Mol, Kate Hudson, Alicia Witt, Sarah Polley, and Rose McGowan all auditioned for unspecified roles. \"It's the only decent thing out there that doesn't involve taking your clothes off,\" McGowan said in 1998.[6] Mangold also met with Courtney Love to discuss the role of Lisa as well as Alanis Morissette for a role.[7] Parker Posey turned down the role of Lisa,[8][9] while Leelee Sobieski signed on to play Daisy but dropped out weeks before filming began after receiving an offer to star in Joan of Arc.[10][11]\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming primarily took place at Harrisburg State Hospital in Pennsylvania\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFilming took place primarily in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, as well as in Harrisburg State Hospital in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in early 1999.[12] Mechanicsburg was chosen for its old-fashioned appearance and its old-style drugstore simply titled \"Drugs\", all of which gave the film its time-dated appearance. A scene in the trailer shows a van traveling towards downtown Harrisburg over the State Street Bridge, where the Capitol building is clearly visible.[13] Scenes later deleted were also filmed at Reading's Public Museum.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performances of  and  were praised, and Jolie earned the .\n\nGirl, Interrupted received mixed reviews from critics. Audiences responded more positively. As of 2022, the film holds a rating of 54% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 117 reviews, with an average rating of 5.70/10. The site's consensus states: \"Angelina Jolie gives an intense performance, but overall Girl, Interrupted suffers from thin, predictable plotting that fails to capture the power of its source material.\"[14] The film also has a rating of 51 on Metacritic, based 32 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[15] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[16]\n\nWriting for The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote: \"Girl, Interrupted is a small, intense period piece with a hardheaded tough-love attitude toward lazy, self-indulgent little girls flirting with madness: You can drive yourself crazy, or you can get over it. The choice is yours.\"[17] Tom Coates from the BBC wrote: \"Girl, Interrupted is a decent adaptation of [Kaysen's] memoir of this period, neatened up and polished for an audience more familiar with gloss than grit.\"[18] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times was critical of the screenplay adaptation from the source memoir, writing that it has \"a hard time resisting manufacturing obvious, standard-issue drama of the One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest knockoff variety,\" though he conceded that the performances of Ryder and Jolie help the film \"stay as honest as it manages to sporadically be... Both women have connected strongly to their parts, and they ensure their characters' reality even if the dramas they are involved with don't always rise to that standard.\"[19]\n\nPaul Tatara of CNN panned the film's screenplay for containing little \"self-reflection in the dialogue,\" adding that \"Each girl is simply issued a quirk that she drags around like a ball and chain.\" Tatara summarized: \"The good news is that writer-director James Mangold's Girl, Interrupted is one of the best films of the year. The bad news is that you have to be a hyper-sensitive 17-year-old girl to think so.\"[20] Roger Ebert was critical of the film's failure to focus on the themes it presents, writing: \"The film is mostly about character and behavior and although there are individual scenes of powerful acting, there doesn't seem to be a destination. That's why the conclusion is so unsatisfying: The story, having failed to provide itself with character conflicts that can be resolved with drama, turns to melodrama instead.\"[21]\n\nCharlotte O'Sullivan of the Time Out Film Guide praised Jolie's performance, but was critical of Ryder's, writing: \"Does it matter that every time Jolie's offscreen the film wilts a little? Ryder should be perfect as the bright spark; her lines are sharp as a knife. There's a gap, however, between what we hear and what we see. Ryder's too wide-eyed and cutesy, and when we see her with nurse Valerie (Goldberg), we know it's only a matter of time before they start hugging.\"[22] The San Francisco Chronicle's Peter Stack was unimpressed by the film, deeming it \"a muddled production that misses the jarring tone of the autobiographical book by Susanna Kaysen on which it is based. The film is entertaining, but not very powerful.\"[23] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film a mixed review, awarding it two out of four stars, writing that \"[Ryder] is often just a crumpled, listless figure on a bed, which, while true to the nature of depression, is not, cinematically speaking, the most arresting image,\" and likening the performances of Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave as \"bordering on cameos\".[24]\n\n### Author opinion\n\nThe author, Susanna Kaysen, was among the detractors of the film, accusing Mangold of adding \"melodramatic drivel\" to the story by inventing plot points that were not in the book (such as Lisa and Susanna running away together).[25]\n\n## Themes\n\n### Confusion of social nonconformity with insanity\n\nSusanna wonders if her prolonged stay at Claymoore is justified. The doctor is hasty in his analysis of her and bases his diagnosis on preconceived ideas relating to gender bias. Her diagnosis suggests that \"normal\" is as relative as insanity is, and Kaysen interrogates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of borderline personality disorder, calling it a \"generalization\" rather than a specific case study. She points out that while she is considered recovered from that condition, she still has the first symptom, which is \"uncertainty about several life issues\".[26] While Susanna is speaking to her doctor Melvin, she calls the rest of the patients \"fucking crazy\" and that she does not belong with them; however, her parents and the doctor think otherwise, and soon she also realizes that she's not much different than them.\n\n### Forced institutionalization\n\nLisa calls therapy \"the-rapey\", which is a play on words insinuating that the therapy they are forced to undergo in the institution feels like rape (psychological) and says the more a person divulges their secrets, the more likely they would be considered for release. However, on the flip side for people like Susanna and Lisa, who claim to have no secrets, the option of release seems oblique. \"Although the construct of the asylum represented an immeasurable tool in the pursuit to expiate mental illness, the respect for patient autonomy appeared to have been relegated to those without mental illness\".[27] In 1973, the infamous phrase \"dying with one's rights on\" was coined by Darold Treffert, referring to the ultimate prioritization of patient autonomy over beneficence.\n\n### Representations of being a woman with mental illness\n\nThe emergence of women's liberation movements in the 1960s is of significance to the period Kaysen's memoir is set. The rights as well as standards were set much differently for women than they were for men. Doctor Melvin originally doesn't inform Susanna of her diagnosis, deeming it was unnecessary for her to know.[28] Eventually, when he informs her of the diagnosis, he cites the disorder being more common in women than in men. Subsequent studies on the understandings of the linkages between gender and mental health since the 1960s and 1970s have identified a more even gender balance in overall levels of mental health as they have incorporated a wider range of disorders.[29]\n\n### Isolation\n\nThe physical depiction of Claymoore is reminiscent of a prison. With bar-covered windows and regular room inspections to make sure the girls are not causing harm to themselves as well as not trying to escape, the girls are subject to the mercy of the ever-watchful staff. The theme of isolation is exhibited in Susanna's life as neither her parents nor her boyfriend (who quits after a few attempts) come to visit her in the institution. The theme of isolation also serves as a protective shield from the dangers of the outside world as even Lisa complains that \"there's nobody to take care of you out there\", and people like Torch are safe from an abusive home and drug-pushing environment.[30]\n\n## Accolades\n\n| Award ceremony                          | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                       | Recipient(s)      | Result    | Ref(s)    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards                          | March 26, 2000      | Best Supporting Actress                                        | Angelina Jolie    | Won       | [31]      |\n| Artios Awards                           | November 1, 2000    | Best Casting in a Feature Film – Drama                         | Lisa Beach        | Nominated | [32]      |\n| Blockbuster Entertainment Awards        | May 9, 2000         | Favorite Actress – Drama                                       | Winona Ryder      | Nominated | [33]      |\n| Blockbuster Entertainment Awards        | May 9, 2000         | Favorite Supporting Actress – Drama                            | Angelina Jolie    | Won       | [33]      |\n| Chicago Film Critics Association Awards | March 13, 2000      | Best Supporting Actress                                        | Angelina Jolie    | Nominated | [34]      |\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards            | January 24, 2000    | Best Supporting Actress                                        | Angelina Jolie    | Won       | [35]      |\n| Empire Awards                           | February 19, 2001   | Best Actress                                                   | Angelina Jolie    | Nominated | [36]      |\n| Golden Globe Awards                     | January 23, 2000    | Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture                       | Angelina Jolie    | Won       | [37]      |\n| San Diego Film Critics Society Awards   | December 20, 1999   | Best Supporting Actress                                        | Angelina Jolie    | Runner-up | [38]      |\n| Screen Actors Guild Awards              | March 12, 2000      | Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role | Angelina Jolie    | Won       | [39]      |\n| Teen Choice Awards                      | August 6, 2000      | Choice Movie – Drama                                           | Girl, Interrupted | Nominated | [40]      |\n| Teen Choice Awards                      | August 6, 2000      | Choice Movie Actress                                           | Angelina Jolie    | Nominated | [40]      |\n| Teen Choice Awards                      | August 6, 2000      | Choice Movie – Hissy Fit                                       | Angelina Jolie    | Nominated | [40]      |\n| Young Artist Awards                     | March 19, 2000      | Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film                   | Brittany Murphy   | Nominated | [41]      |\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThe film's official soundtrack was released on January 18, 2000.[42]\n\n|   No. | Title                          | Artist                  | Length   |\n|-------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|\n|     1 | \"Downtown\"                     | Petula Clark            | 3:05     |\n|     2 | \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\" | Them                    | 3:50     |\n|     3 | \"Got a Feelin'\"                | The Mamas and the Papas | 2:44     |\n|     4 | \"Time Has Come Today\"          | The Chambers Brothers   | 2:37     |\n|     5 | \"Comin' Back to Me\"            | Jefferson Airplane      | 5:14     |\n|     6 | \"Angel of the Morning\"         | Merrilee Rush           | 3:19     |\n|     7 | \"Right Time\"                   | Aretha Franklin         | 4:45     |\n|     8 | \"How to Fight Loneliness\"      | Wilco                   | 3:52     |\n|     9 | \"The Weight\"                   | The Band                | 4:23     |\n|    10 | \"The End of the World\"         | Skeeter Davis           | 2:33     |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Girl, Interrupted (1999)\".

It stars Davidson, Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Bel Powley, Maude Apatow, and Steve Buscemi, and follows a young man who must get his life together after his mother starts dating a new man who, like his deceased father, is a firefighter.\n\nThe film was announced as Apatow's next project in early 2019, with the cast joining that April. Filming took place around New York City in June and July. The film has been called a \"semi-biographical\" take on the life of Davidson, whose father was a New York City firefighter who died in service during the September 11 attacks and who has had his own battles with mental illness.\n\nOriginally intended to be released theatrically in the United States, the film was released on premium video on demand (PVOD) on June 12, 2020, by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n## Plot\n\nTwenty-four-year-old high school dropout Scott Carlin lives with his mother Margie and his sister Claire in Staten Island. His firefighter father Stan died fighting a fire when he was seven, a loss that continues to affect him; he also deals with numerous medical problems, including Crohn's disease and ADD, and smokes marijuana often.\n\nUnemployed, Scott spends his days hanging out with his friends, including Kelsey, whom he is sleeping with. She wants the relationship to be more serious, but he fears commitment and that he is not good enough for her. Claire, who is leaving for college, is concerned Scott's neuroses may grow out of control with her gone.\n\nScott dreams of being a tattoo artist and practices regularly on his friends, although his work is extremely inconsistent. One day, while hanging out with them at the beach, he is approached by 9-year-old Harold. Harold asks Scott to give him a tattoo, but runs off after getting a single line. Later, Harold's father, Ray, shows up at Scott's house.\n\nInitially furious, Ray finds himself attracted to Margie and he eventually asks her out. Though she has not dated since Stan's death, she agrees. As things get more serious, Margie reveals their relationship to Scott, who is disturbed that he, like Stan, is a firefighter. Ray takes Scott to a Staten Island Yankees game with his co-workers but finds it difficult to talk to Scott, who argues that firefighters should not have families because of the pain that is caused by their deaths.\n\nMargie and Ray give Scott an ultimatum to move out, which upsets him. While visiting Claire, he tells her he plans to break up their mom and Ray, as the relationship is 'unhealthy'. Scott gets a job as a busboy, and begins walking Harold and his sister Kelly to school each day, growing close with them.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott's friends plan to rob a pharmacy for oxycodone pills to sell. He is uncomfortable with the plan but agrees to be the lookout. The robbery goes awry when the pharmacist and his wife confront them. Oscar is shot and all three are arrested, but Scott flees.\n\nScott talks with Ray's ex-wife Gina, who tells him several negative things about Ray, painting him as a homeless gambling addict. He relays this to Margie, only to end up in a physical confrontation with Ray when he hears what Scott told her. A furious Margie kicks both men out.\n\nWith his friends in jail, Scott struggles to find a place to stay. He hopes that Kelsey will let him stay with her after they sleep together, but she is indignant when she recognizes his ulterior motives and refuses. Desperate, Scott goes to Ray's firehouse, where he is told he may stay in return for doing chores.\n\nScott gradually bonds with Ray and the other firefighters, who tell him stories about his father, which humanizes him and helps Scott accept his death. Ray learns from Harold that Scott is a talented artist, and agrees to let him tattoo his back as practice, but within certain limits.\n\nOne day, a man shows up at the firehouse with an abdominal wound while Scott is there alone.

The film was set to be written by Apatow, Davidson, and Dave Sirus with Apatow and Sirus also producing the film.[5] Davidson first came to Apatow's attention while working on Trainwreck after he was recommended by Amy Schumer, and he was cast in a cameo role in that film. The story is based in part on Davidson's life, depicting what it might have been like if he had not become a comedian.[6][7]\n\nIn April 2019, Bel Powley, Bill Burr and Marisa Tomei were added to the cast.[8][9] Maude Apatow and Pamela Adlon joined in May.[10] In June 2019, Colson Baker, Jimmy Tatro, Ricky Velez, Steve Buscemi, Kevin Corrigan, Domenick Lombardozzi, Mike Vecchione, Moisés Arias, Lou Wilson and Derek Gaines joined the cast of the film.[11][12][13][14][15]\n\nPrincipal photography began June 3, 2019, in Staten Island[16] and concluded on August 9.[17]\n\n## Release\n\nThe King of Staten Island was set to have its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 13, 2020,[18][19] but the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[20] It was rescheduled to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 20, 2020,[21] which was also cancelled due to the pandemic.[22] Originally scheduled for a theatrical release on June 19, 2020, the film was instead released digitally in the United States and Canada on premium video on demand (PVOD) on June 12, 2020, due to movie theaters closures that started in mid-March because of the pandemic restrictions.[23][24] It was initially set to play in about 100 theaters, mostly drive-ins, beginning the same day as its VOD release, but Universal Pictures changed course after consulting the film's producers.[25]\n\nThe film was released in cinemas in the Netherlands on June 25, 2020, France on July 22, Germany on July 30, and Spain on October 9.[3] The film made $253,000 from 160 theaters in its Australian debut and $59,000 in New Zealand.[26]\n\nAs of March 27, 2022, the film had earned an estimated $4.5 million in theatrical and home markets,[4] as well as an estimated $40 million in video-on-demand sales across various platforms.[citation needed]\n\n## Reception\n\n### VOD sales\n\nIn its debut weekend, The King of Staten Island was the most rented film on FandangoNow, Amazon Prime, the iTunes Store, Comcast Xfinity, Apple TV, Vudu, Google Play, YouTube, Spectrum, and DirecTV.[27][28][29] It remained the top rented film across all platforms in second weekend, then on all but FandangoNow in its third.[30][31] After a month of release, the film remained the number-one rented title on Prime, and in the top-five on all other platforms.[32] In late-August, the price was lowered to $5.99 and it returned to the second-most rented movie on Fandango and third on Apple TV.[33] In October 2020, The Hollywood Reporter said the film had generated $40 million in revenue for Universal up to that point. They also reported the film was the seventh-most popular PVOD title amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 287 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"The King of Staten Island's uncertain tone and indulgent length blunt this coming-of-age dramedy's ability to find itself, but Pete Davidson's soulful performance holds it together.\"[34] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[35]\n\nWriting for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper called the film \"sharp and funny\" and gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying that \"Davidson delivers a fully realized, nuanced performance, tackling dark comedy and raw drama with equal aplomb.\"[36] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B+\" and called it \"a sweet and tender dramedy\", writing: \"Teetering between self-parody and something truly beautiful, Apatow's latest offers yet another shaggy portrait of permanent adolescence but this one — his best film since 2009's Funny People — helps make sense of why he always keeps going back to the same archetype.\"[37]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"The King of Staten Island\".

It stars Davidson, Marisa Tomei, Bill Burr, Bel Powley, Maude Apatow, and Steve Buscemi, and follows a young man who must get his life together after his mother starts dating a new man who, like his deceased father, is a firefighter.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <PlotDetails>\n        Twenty-four-year-old high school dropout Scott Carlin lives with his mother Margie and his sister Claire in Staten Island. His firefighter father Stan died fighting a fire when he was seven, a loss that continues to affect him; he also deals with numerous medical problems, including Crohn's disease and ADD, and smokes marijuana often.\n        \n        Unemployed, Scott spends his days hanging out with his friends, including Kelsey, whom he is sleeping with. She wants the relationship to be more serious, but he fears commitment and that he is not good enough for her. Claire, who is leaving for college, is concerned Scott's neuroses may grow out of control with her gone.\n        \n        Scott dreams of being a tattoo artist and practices regularly on his friends, although his work is extremely inconsistent. One day, while hanging out with them at the beach, he is approached by 9-year-old Harold. Harold asks Scott to give him a tattoo, but runs off after getting a single line. Later, Harold's father, Ray, shows up at Scott's house.\n        \n        Initially furious, Ray finds himself attracted to Margie and he eventually asks her out. Though she has not dated since Stan's death, she agrees. As things get more serious, Margie reveals their relationship to Scott, who is disturbed that he, like Stan, is a firefighter. Ray takes Scott to a Staten Island Yankees game with his co-workers but finds it difficult to talk to Scott, who argues that firefighters should not have families because of the pain that is caused by their deaths.\n        \n        Margie and Ray give Scott an ultimatum to move out, which upsets him. While visiting Claire, he tells her he plans to break up their mom and Ray, as the relationship is 'unhealthy'. Scott gets a job as a busboy, and begins walking Harold and his sister Kelly to school each day, growing close with them.\n        \n        Meanwhile, Scott's friends plan to rob a pharmacy for oxycodone pills to sell. He is uncomfortable with the plan but agrees to be the lookout. The robbery goes awry when the pharmacist and his wife confront them. Oscar is shot and all three are arrested, but Scott flees.\n        \n        Scott talks with Ray's ex-wife Gina, who tells him several negative things about Ray, painting him as a homeless gambling addict. He relays this to Margie, only to end up in a physical confrontation with Ray when he hears what Scott told her. A furious Margie kicks both men out.\n        \n        With his friends in jail, Scott struggles to find a place to stay. He hopes that Kelsey will let him stay with her after they sleep together, but she is indignant when she recognizes his ulterior motives and refuses. Desperate, Scott goes to Ray's firehouse, where he is told he may stay in return for doing chores.\n        \n        Scott gradually bonds with Ray and the other firefighters, who tell him stories about his father, which humanizes him and helps Scott accept his death. Ray learns from Harold that Scott is a talented artist, and agrees to let him tattoo his back as practice, but within certain limits.\n        \n        One day, a man shows up at the firehouse with an abdominal wound while Scott is there alone. He takes him to the hospital, where Ray arrives, using his firefighter connections to get the man the help he needs. Margie, who works as an emergency room nurse, sees Scott and Ray and reconciles with them both.\n        \n        Ray shows Margie his tattoos; a number of them are offensive or violate his criteria, but the most prominent is one of Margie, Ray, Scott, and Claire together (plus their dad as the sun). Scott surprises Kelsey at the Staten Island Ferry, where she is heading into Manhattan to take a civil service exam. He rides on the ferry with her, where he confesses his love for her, and they kiss. Kelsey heads into the exam, asking him to wait for her.\n    </PlotDetails>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information about \"The King of Staten Island\" according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains coherent and informative while highlighting key details with XML tags.",

I was around 13 years old, and I absolutely loved it. It was scary and mysterious, and its themes of perfection were blunt enough to resonate with me at the time.

The film stars Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider, Kelli Garner, and Patricia Clarkson. Its plot follows Lars, a kind-hearted but socially awkward young man who develops a romantic yet nonsexual relationship with an anatomically correct sex doll, a RealDoll named Bianca.\n\nThe movie was inspired by photographer Elena Dorfman’s work Still Lovers.[3]\n\nLars and the Real Girl was released in the United States on October 12, 2007, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. Though a commercial failure, the film was positively received by critics, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, while Gosling received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.\n\n## Plot\n\nLars Lindstrom lives a secluded life in a small town. His mother died when he was born, causing his grief-stricken father to have been a distant parent to Lars and his older brother, Gus. Gus feels guilty for leaving as soon as he could support himself; Lars struggles with the loss of his mother during his birth and an irrational fear about the risk of death during childbirth.  As a result, he exhibits avoidance behaviors and haphephobia, causing social awkwardness and isolation.\n\nHaving inherited the family home after their father's death, the two brothers live on the property along with Gus' wife, Karin.  Lars lives in the converted garage, while Gus and Karin, who is pregnant with their first child, live in the main house. Despite Karin's efforts to bring Lars out of his shell, interacting with or relating to his family and co-workers is very difficult for him. A colleague at his office, Margo, also tries to engage him, but Lars is impervious to her attempts.\n\nOne evening, Lars announces that he has a visitor whom he met online, a wheelchair-mobile missionary of Brazilian and Danish descent named Bianca. Gus and Karin are startled to discover that Bianca is actually a lifelike doll, ordered from an adult website, whom Lars treats as a live human being. Concerned about his mental health, they convince him to take Bianca to see the family doctor, Dagmar Berman, who is also a psychologist. Berman diagnoses Bianca with low blood pressure and urges Lars to return under the guise of \"weekly treatments\" for Bianca, while actually analyzing Lars. During this time, Margo has begun to date another co-worker, which silently bothers Lars.\n\nLars introduces Bianca as his girlfriend to his co-workers and various townspeople. Sympathetic to Lars, the town inhabitants react to the doll as if she were real; however,  in order to reduce Lars' dependence on her, they fill her \"schedule\" with social events and volunteer programs. When Margo reveals to Lars she has broken up with her boyfriend, he agrees to go bowling with her while Bianca attends a school board meeting; later they are joined by more friends.\n\nOne morning, Gus and Karin are awakened by a panicked Lars, alarmed because Bianca is unresponsive, and she is rushed to the hospital. After Lars tells Gus and Karin that Bianca is dying, Berman explains that Lars alone has made these decisions about Bianca's future.  During a last visit to the lake, Gus and Karin witness a despondent Lars in the water with a \"dying\" Bianca.\n\nBianca's funeral is well-attended by the townspeople; after she is buried, Lars and Margo linger at the gravesite. When Margo suggests they catch up with the others, Lars asks if she would like to take a walk. She accepts.\n\n## Allusions\n\nLars has aspects of a modern Pygmalion, and the film adapts the legend as a romantic comedy.[4] Pygmalion falls in love with his statue of a beautiful woman: “He often felt the statue with his hands, to see if it was flesh, or ivory still, and then no longer admitted it was ivory.”[5] While Aphrodite answers Pygmalion's prayers  and brings the statue Galatea to life, the story of Lars instead concludes with the doll Bianca being mourned as though she had been alive.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Ryan Gosling as Lars Lindstrom\n- Emily Mortimer as Karin Lindstrom\n- Paul Schneider as Gus Lindstrom\n- R.

While researching \"weird websites\" for an article, Oliver found RealDoll.com. She wrote the script in 2002.[6] The script was the third-ranked screenplay in The Black List in 2005.[7][8]\n\nThe film, set in the US state of Wisconsin, was filmed with a $12 million budget on location in Alton, Elora, King Township, Toronto, Uxbridge, and Whitevale, all located in the Canadian province of Ontario.[9][10]\n\nFilm credits include Rosalie MacKintosh as \"Bianca wrangler\" and Karly Bowen as \"assistant Bianca wrangler.\"[11][12]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2007, before going into limited release in the U.S. on October 12, 2007. It initially opened on seven screens in New York City, New York; and Los Angeles, California, and earned $90,418 on its opening weekend. It later expanded to 321 theaters and remained in release for 147 days, earning $5,972,884 domestically and $5,320,639 in other markets for a worldwide box-office total of $11,293,663.[2]\n\nThe film was featured at the Austin Film Festival, the Heartland Film Festival, the Torino Film Festival, the Glasgow Film Festival, and the Las Palmas de Gran Canaria International Film Festival.[13]\n\n## Critical reception\n\nLars and the Real Girl received positive reviews from critics, especially for Gosling's performance.[14] On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 81%, based on reviews from 140 critics, and an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"Lars and the Real Girl could've so easily been a one-joke movie. But the talented cast, a great script, and direction never condescend to its character or the audience.\"[15] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 32 reviews.[16]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of four and observed, \"The film wisely never goes for even one moment that could be interpreted as smutty or mocking. There are so many ways [it] could have gone wrong that one of the film's fascinations is how adroitly it sidesteps them. Its weapon is absolute sincerity. It has a kind of purity to it.\"[17]\n\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called the film \"a gentle comedy, offbeat but never cute, never lewd and never going for shortcut laughs that might diminish character.\"[18]\n\nManohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \"American self-nostalgia is a dependable racket, and if the filmmakers had pushed into the realm of nervous truth, had given Lars and the town folk sustained shadows, not just cute tics and teary moments, it might have worked. Instead the film is palatable audience bait of average accomplishment that superficially recalls the plain style of Alexander Payne, but without any of the lacerating edges or moral ambiguity.\"[19]\n\nKenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described it as \"the sweetest, most innocent, most completely enjoyable film around,\" \"a film whose daring and delicate blend of apparent irreconcilables will sweep you off your feet if you're not careful. The creators of this film were fiercely determined not to go so much as a millimeter over the line into sentiment, tawdriness or mockery. It's the rare film that is the best possible version of itself, but Lars fits that bill.\"[20]\n\nAlissa Simon of Variety stated, \"Craig Gillespie's sweetly off-kilter film plays like a Coen brothers riff on Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon tales, defying its lurid premise with a gentle comic drama grounded in reality ... what's fresh and charming is the way the characters surrounding the protagonist also grow as they help him through his crisis.\"[21]\n\n## Accolades\n\n| Award                              | Date of ceremony    | Category                                                  | Recipients             | Result    |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards                     | February 24, 2008   | Best Original Screenplay                                  | Nancy Oliver           | Nominated |\n| Chicago Film Critics Association   | December 13, 2007   | Best Actor                                                | Ryan Gosling           | Nominated |\n| Chicago Film Critics Association   | December 13, 2007   | Most Promising Director                                   | Craig Gillespie        | Nominated |\n| Critics' Choice Awards             | January 7, 2007     | Best Actor                                                | Ryan Gosling           | Nominated |\n| Critics' Choice Awards             | January 7, 2007     | Best Screenplay                                           | Nancy Oliver           | Nominated |\n| Golden Globe Awards                | January 13, 2008    | Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy             | Ryan Gosling           | Nominated |\n| Humanitas Prize                    | September 17, 2008  | Feature Film                                              | Nancy Oliver           | Won       |\n| National Board of Review           | January 15, 2008    | Top Ten Films                                             | Lars and the Real Girl | Won       |\n| National Board of Review           | January 15, 2008    | Best Original Screenplay                                  | Nancy Oliver           | Won       |\n| Satellite Awards                   | December 16, 2007   | Best Film – Musical or Comedy                             | Lars and the Real Girl | Nominated |\n| Satellite Awards                   | December 16, 2007   | Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy             | Ryan Gosling           | Won       |\n| Satellite Awards                   | December 16, 2007   | Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy           | Emily Mortimer         | Nominated |\n| Satellite Awards                   | December 16, 2007   | Best Original Screenplay                                  | Nancy Oliver           | Nominated |\n| Screen Actors Guild Awards         | January 27, 2008    | Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role | Ryan Gosling           | Nominated |\n| St. Louis Film Critics Association | December 24, 2007   | Best Film – Musical or Comedy                             | Lars and the Real Girl | Nominated |\n| St. Louis Film Critics Association | December 24, 2007   | Best Actor                                                | Ryan Gosling           | Nominated |\n| St. Louis Film Critics Association | December 24, 2007   | Best Screenplay                                           | Nancy Oliver           | Nominated |\n| Writers Guild of America Awards    | February 9, 2008    | Best Original Screenplay                                  | Nancy Oliver           | Nominated |\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Lars and the Real Girl (2007) - Financial Information\".

His mother died when he was born, causing his grief-stricken father to have been a distant parent to Lars and his older brother, Gus. Gus feels guilty for leaving as soon as he could support himself; Lars struggles with the loss of his mother during his birth and an irrational fear about the risk of death during childbirth. As a result, he exhibits avoidance behaviors and haphephobia, causing social awkwardness and isolation.\n\n        Having inherited the family home after their father's death, the two brothers live on the property along with Gus' wife, Karin. Lars lives in the converted garage, while Gus and Karin, who is pregnant with their first child, live in the main house. Despite Karin's efforts to bring Lars out of his shell, interacting with or relating to his family and co-workers is very difficult for him. A colleague at his office, Margo, also tries to engage him, but Lars is impervious to her attempts.\n\n        One evening, Lars announces that he has a visitor whom he met online, a wheelchair-mobile missionary of Brazilian and Danish descent named Bianca. Gus and Karin are startled to discover that Bianca is actually a lifelike doll, ordered from an adult website, whom Lars treats as a live human being. Concerned about his mental health, they convince him to take Bianca to see the family doctor, Dagmar Berman, who is also a psychologist. Berman diagnoses Bianca with low blood pressure and urges Lars to return under the guise of \"weekly treatments\" for Bianca, while actually analyzing Lars. During this time, Margo has begun to date another co-worker, which silently bothers Lars.\n\n        Lars introduces Bianca as his girlfriend to his co-workers and various townspeople. Sympathetic to Lars, the town inhabitants react to the doll as if she were real; however, in order to reduce Lars' dependence on her, they fill her \"schedule\" with social events and volunteer programs. When Margo reveals to Lars she has broken up with her boyfriend, he agrees to go bowling with her while Bianca attends a school board meeting; later they are joined by more friends.\n\n        One morning, Gus and Karin are awakened by a panicked Lars, alarmed because Bianca is unresponsive, and she is rushed to the hospital. After Lars tells Gus and Karin that Bianca is dying, Berman explains that Lars alone has made these decisions about Bianca's future. During a last visit to the lake, Gus and Karin witness a despondent Lars in the water with a \"dying\" Bianca.\n\n        Bianca's funeral is well-attended by the townspeople; after she is buried, Lars and Margo linger at the gravesite. When Margo suggests they catch up with the others, Lars asks if she would like to take a walk. She accepts.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <CriticalReception>\n        Lars and the Real Girl received positive reviews from critics, especially for Gosling's performance. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 81%, based on reviews from 140 critics, and an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"Lars and the Real Girl could've so easily been a one-joke movie. But the talented cast, a great script, and direction never condescend to its character or the audience.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 32 reviews.\n\n        Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of four and observed, \"The film wisely never goes for even one moment that could be interpreted as smutty or mocking. There are so many ways [it] could have gone wrong that one of the film's fascinations is how adroitly it sidesteps them. Its weapon is absolute sincerity. It has a kind of purity to it.\"\n    </CriticalReception>\n    \n    <Accolades>\n        <Award>\n            <Name>Academy Awards</Name>\n            <Date>February 24, 2008</Date>\n            <Category>Best Original Screenplay</Category>\n            <Recipients>Nancy Oliver</Recipients>\n            <Result>Nominated</Result>\n        </Award>\n        <Award>\n            <Name>Golden Globe Awards</Name>\n            <Date>January 13, 2008</Date>\n            <Category>Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy</Category>\n            <Recipients>Ryan Gosling</Recipients>\n            <Result>Nominated</Result>\n        </Award>\n        <Award>\n            <Name>Humanitas Prize</Name>\n            <Date>September 17, 2008</Date>\n            <Category>Feature Film</Category>\n            <Recipients>Nancy Oliver</Recipients>\n            <Result>Won</Result>\n        </Award>\n    </Accolades>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the relevant information is tagged according to the specified attributes.

It is based on the 1996 novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with a soap salesman, Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled with an impoverished but beguiling woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.[5][6]\n\nStudio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999, and was released in the United States on\nOctober 15, 1999, by 20th Century Fox. The film failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. However, Fight Club later found commercial success with its home video release, establishing it as a cult classic and causing media to revisit the film. In 2009, on its tenth anniversary, The New York Times dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\"[7]\n\n## Plot\n\nThe unnamed Narrator, who struggles with insomnia and dissatisfaction with his job and lifestyle, finds temporary solace in support groups. As his insomnia worsens, he discovers that expressions of emotional vulnerability help him sleep, leading him to join multiple groups for people facing emotionally distressing problems, despite his expressions being fraudulent. His efforts are thwarted when Marla Singer, another impostor, joins the same groups. The Narrator cannot present his fabricated struggles as genuine, or divert his attention from her presence as an impostor, causing his sleeplessness to return. He arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn a return flight from work, the Narrator meets a soap salesman, Tyler Durden. After an explosion destroys the Narrator's apartment, he moves into Tyler's decrepit house. They become friends and start an underground fight club in a bar basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her.\n\nThe Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows the fight club, attracting new members, including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing vandalism to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator's apartment and then goes missing. Bob is killed by the police during a mission, prompting the Narrator to attempt to stop the project and look for Tyler. Discovering the project's nationwide reach and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and other people, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities.\n\nLearning that Project Mayhem plans to erase debt records by blowing up the headquarters of credit-card companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. The Narrator shoots himself in the mouth, killing Tyler. Marla arrives and she and the Narrator hold hands as they watch the targeted buildings collapse.\n\n## Cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(left) in 2009 and  (right) in 2019\n\n- Edward Norton as the Narrator.

There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore. In that societal emasculation this everyman [the Narrator] is created.\n\nFincher said Fight Club was a coming of age film, like the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an \"everyman\";[8] the character is identified in the script as \"Jack\", but left unnamed in the film.[9] Fincher outlined the Narrator's background, \"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \"kill\" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.[10]\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the Graduate archetype: \"a guy who does not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained, \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\"[8] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.[11]\n\nScreenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a romantic comedy, explaining, \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\"[12] The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.[13] While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring.[14] When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.[13]\n\nWe decided early on that I would start to starve myself as the film went on, while [Brad Pitt] would lift and go to tanning beds; he would become more and more idealized as I wasted away.\n\nThe Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler.[16] He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful,[17] though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires \"real experiences\" of actual fights like the Narrator at first,[18] he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems.[19] His impulsive nature, representing the id,[13] is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing;[19] he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps.[13] The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves.[14]\n\nFight Club examines Generation X angst as \"the middle children of history\".[6] Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had \"its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture\", and was told one could achieve \"spiritual happiness through home furnishing\".[5][18] His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, \"It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.\"[20] Pitt said, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.\"[21]\n\nFight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system.[18]  The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to \"a generation of spectators\".[22] A culture of advertising defines society's \"external signifiers of happiness\", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, \"We smash it ... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.\"[23] Pitt explained the dissonance, \"I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.\"[21]\n\nThe violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb.[24] The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be \"cocooned\" in society.[22] Norton believed the fighting strips away the \"fear of pain\" and \"the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth\", leaving them to experience something valuable.[18] When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas.[14] Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience.[19] Fincher said, \"I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution.\"[11]\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nThe novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its publication, a Fox Searchlight Pictures book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000 Pictures, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.[25]\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. The book was also sent to David O. Russell, but he couldn't understand it.[26] David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for Fox. To repair his relationship with Fox, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic.[25] In August 1997, Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of Fight Club.[27]\n\n### Casting\n\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.[25] Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film Meet Joe Black, and the studio believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5 million.[28]\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as Matt Damon to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt.[29] Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Man on the Moon. He was cast in Runaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5 million for Fight Club. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job.[28]\n\nIn January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast.[30] The actors prepared by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling,[31] and soapmaking.[32] Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.[33]\n\nFincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo. While Fincher initially stated that she turned it down because she objected to the film's sexual content, in an interview in 2020, Garofalo revealed that she did accept the role, but was dropped because Norton believed she was poorly suited to it.[34][35] Fincher pitched the role to Julia Louis-Dreyfus.[36] The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates.[37] Love claimed that she was cast as Marla Singer, but was fired after she rejected Pitt's pitch for a film about her late husband, Kurt Cobain.[38] The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher felt she was too young.[28] Sarah Michelle Gellar turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with Buffy The Vampire Slayer.[39] Finally, Fincher chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.[40]\n\n### Writing\n\nWhen Uhls first encountered the novel, it was in the form of a manuscript, though it already had a publisher. In his interview he stated that he read it just for enjoyment and was blown away by it.[41] He started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived the technique as \"hackneyed and trite\" at the time. When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice.[28] He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly \"sad and pathetic\".[42] Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.[28]\n\nPalahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, \"If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.\"[43] Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists.[44] The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, \"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,\" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.[13] Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth.[45]\n\nThe Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution.[11] Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.[14] Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him, \"I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.\"[11]\n\n### Filming\n\nStudio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of $23 million to finance the film,[25] but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50 million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to $67 million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least $5 million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing.[46] The final production budget was $63–65 million.[1][4]\n\nThe fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to \"go full out\" to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them.[21] Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, inspired by the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear.[47] Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for \"wet sweat\". Meat Loaf, who plays a fight club member who has \"bitch tits\", wore a 90-pound (40 kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts.[31] He also wore eight-inch (20 cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.[13]\n\nFilming lasted 138 days from July to December 1998,[48] during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.[31]  The locations were in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio in Century City.[48] Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets.[31] The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California,[49] while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters.[48] Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA.[16] Overall, production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room, \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"[50]\n\n### Cinematography\n\nFincher used the Super 35 format to film Fight Club since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father Jordan Cronenweth had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film Alien 3, but left midway through production due to Parkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films Seven and The Game, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for Fight Club.[48]\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\".[16] The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.[48] Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"smack-fiend patina\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.[16]\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.[48] On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.[13]\n\nFight Club was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.[48]\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over-the-shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect.[16] Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\".[13] Fincher explained the subliminal frames, \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"[51]\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on Fight Club, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be underexposed, Technicolor's ENR silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase the density of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.[16]\n\n### Visual effects\n\nFincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on The Game, to create visual effects for Fight Club. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"mind's eye\" view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.[51]\n\nThe opening scene in Fight Club that represents a brain's neural network in which the thought processes are initiated by the Narrator's fear impulse. The network was mapped using an L-system and drawn out by a medical illustrator.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse.[52] The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.[51] Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system,[53] and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process.[51]\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100 photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen months.[51]\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue mark—nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film—to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained, \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\"[51]\n\n### Score\n\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead,[13] but the singer, Thom Yorke, declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their 1997 album OK Computer.[54] Fincher instead commissioned the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers, who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup, \"Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that.\"[55] The climax and end credits feature the song \"Where Is My Mind?\" by Pixies.[56]\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nFilming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare Fight Club for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film.[57] Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response, \"So many incidences of Fight Club were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.\"[58] Nevertheless, Fight Club was originally slated to be released in July 1999,[59] but was later changed to August 6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process.[60] Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.[61]\n\nMarketing executives at Fox Searchlight Pictures faced difficulties in marketing Fight Club and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Federation broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.[57] Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to Fight Club's lukewarm box office performance in the United States.[62]\n\n### Theatrical run\n\nThe studio held Fight Club's world premiere at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999.[63][64] For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13 million and US$15 million in its opening weekend.[65] Fight Club opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October 15, 1999, and earned US$11 million in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend.[1] The film ranked first at the weekend box office, beating Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener.[66] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.[67] The gender mix of audiences for Fight Club, argued to be \"the ultimate anti-date flick\", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations.[68] Over the second weekend, Fight Club dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning US$6.3 million.[69] In its original theatrical run, the film grossed US$37 million in the United States and Canada, and US$63.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of US$100.9 million. (With subsequent re-releases, the film's worldwide gross increased to $101.2 million.)[1] The underwhelming North American performance of Fight Club soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.[70]\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification reviewed Fight Club for its November 12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving \"an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp\". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that Fight Club contained \"dangerously instructive information\" and could \"encourage anti-social (behavior)\". The board decided, \"The film as a whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels.\"[71] The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.[72] In February 2024, in advance of a theatrical re-release, the BBFC lowered the classification from 18 to 15.[73]\n\n### Home media\n\nFincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2000, in both one and two-disc editions.[74] The movie disc included four commentary tracks,[75] while the bonus disc contained behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, theater safety PSAs, the promotional music video \"This is Your Life\", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials.[76] Fincher worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher's vision, \"The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it.\" The studio developed the packaging for two months.[77] The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title \"Fight Club\" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, \"We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside.\"[77] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design, \"From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.\"[78] It was the first DVD release to feature the THX Optimode.[79]\n\nFight Club won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features.[80] Entertainment Weekly ranked the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of \"The 50 Essential DVDs\", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical picture-and-audio quality.[81] When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests.[82] The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years,[83] making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio's history,[62] in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals.[84] With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release, Fight Club generated a US$10 million profit for the studio.[62]\n\nThe Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000[85] and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very few Dolby Digital Surround EX soundtracks released on LD. The VHS edition was released on October 31, 2000, as a part of 20th Century Fox's \"Premiere Series\" line. It includes a featurette after the film, \"Behind the Brawl\".[86]\n\nFight Club was released on Blu-ray in the United States on November 17, 2009.[87] Five graffiti artists were commissioned to create 30 pieces of art for the packaging, encompassing urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art.[88] The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the Fight Club menu screen. Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.[89]\n\nAn online release in China from Tencent censored the bomb blasts at the end and replaced the ending with a message that Project Mayhem was thwarted,[90] with Tyler Durden being arrested by law enforcement and placed in an insane asylum until 2012, adapting the ending of the original Fight Club novel.[91] Weeks later, Tencent released a version of the film restoring 11 of the 12 minutes that had previously been cut.[92][93] The novel's author Chuck Palahniuk believed the censored version partially restored the book's ending.[94][95]\n\nIn October 2024, Fincher confirmed he would oversee a 4K remaster of the film.[96]\n\n## Critical reception\n\nCineaste's Gary Crowdus summarized the critical reception at the time, \"Many critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.\" He wrote of the negative opinion, \"While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.\"[97] When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, \"Many loved and hated it in equal measures.\" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously.[98] Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction, \"It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.\"[99] Although the film's makers called Fight Club \"an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,\" some critics called it \"irresponsible and appalling.\" Writing for The Australian, Christopher Goodwin stated, \"Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.\"[100]\n\nJanet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of \"contemporary manhood\", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism.[101] Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave Fight Club two stars out of four, calling it \"visceral and hard-edged\", but also \"a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy\", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as \"trickery\".[102] Ebert later acknowledged that the film was \"beloved by most, not by me\".[103] He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that \"[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.\"[104] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an \"invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz\", but that it eventually became \"explosively silly\".[105] Newsweek's David Ansen described Fight Club as \"an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload\" and thought that the ending was too pretentious.[106] Richard Schickel of Time described the mise en scène as dark and damp: \"It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry.\" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the \"conventionally gimmicky\" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting.[107]\n\nThe film review website Metacritic surveyed 36 critics and assessed 24 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed, and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 67 out of 100, which it said indicated \"generally favorable reviews\".[108] The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 185 critics and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 149 as positive and 36 as negative. For the subset of reviews that had scores, it determined an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. It gave the film a score of 81% and summarized the critical consensus, \"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride.\"[109]\n\n## Accolades\n\nFight Club was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to The Matrix.[110] Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress.[111] The Online Film Critics Society also nominated Fight Club for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls).[112] Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed Fight Club as one of the top ten films of 1999.[113] The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to Notting Hill.[114]\n\n## Legacy and cultural impact\n\nFight Club was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s.[21][115] The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 films Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, and Three Kings, Fight Club was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology.[116] After Fight Club's theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth,[117] and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy \"perennial\" fame.[118][119] The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown.[120]\n\nFollowing Fight Club's release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" was started in Menlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry.[121] Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.[122] An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus.[123] The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.[124] On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop on the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \"Project Mayhem\".[125]\n\nFight Club had a significant impact on evangelical Christianity, in the areas of Christian discipleship and masculinity. A number of churches called their cell groups \"fight clubs\" with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to \"beat up the flesh and believe the gospel of grace\".[126][127] Some churches, especially Mars Hill Church in Seattle, whose pastor Mark Driscoll was obsessed with the film,[128] picked up the film's emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on \"his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.\"[129]\n\nA Fight Club video game was released by Vivendi Universal Games in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, Game Informer, and IGN.[130][131][132] The video game Jet Set Radio, initially released in 2000 for Sega's Dreamcast console, was inspired by the film's anti-establishment themes.[133]\n\nIn 2003, Fight Club was listed as one of the \"50 Best Guy Movies of All Time\" by Men's Journal.[134] In 2004 and 2006, Fight Club was voted by Empire readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively.[135][136] Total Film ranked Fight Club as \"The Greatest Film of our Lifetime\" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary.[137] In 2007, Premiere selected Tyler Durden's line, \"The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,\" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time.[138] In 2008, readers of Empire ranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[139] Empire also identified Fight Club as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[140]\n\nIn 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring Fight Club were released. Ferris Club was a mash-up of Fight Club and the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, \"claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic\".[141] The second video, Jane Austen's Fight Club, also gained popularity online as a mash-up of Fight Club's fighting rules and the characters created by 19th-century novelist Jane Austen.[142]\n\n## See also\n\n- United States portal\n- Film portal\n\n- List of American films of 1999\n- List of cult films\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Fight Club, a film by the American studio 20th Century Fox, is often found in databases and related summaries to have the countries US and Germany, the latter being ascribable to the role of international funding.[2][3]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e f \"Fight Club\".

It is based on the <Genre>1996</Genre> novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with a soap salesman, Tyler Durden (<Name>Brad Pitt</Name>), and becomes embroiled with an impoverished but beguiling woman, Marla Singer (<Name>Helena Bonham Carter</Name>).\n\nPalahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.\n\nStudio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999, and was released in the United States on October 15, 1999, by 20th Century Fox. The film failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. However, Fight Club later found commercial success with its home video release, establishing it as a cult classic and causing media to revisit the film. In 2009, on its tenth anniversary, The New York Times dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\"\n\n<MainThemes>\n    <Theme>Consumerism</Theme>\n    <Theme>Identity</Theme>\n    <Theme>Masculinity</Theme>\n</MainThemes>\n\n## Plot\n\nThe unnamed Narrator, who struggles with insomnia and dissatisfaction with his job and lifestyle, finds temporary solace in support groups. As his insomnia worsens, he discovers that expressions of emotional vulnerability help him sleep, leading him to join multiple groups for people facing emotionally distressing problems, despite his expressions being fraudulent. His efforts are thwarted when Marla Singer, another impostor, joins the same groups. The Narrator cannot present his fabricated struggles as genuine, or divert his attention from her presence as an impostor, causing his sleeplessness to return. He arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn a return flight from work, the Narrator meets a soap salesman, Tyler Durden. After an explosion destroys the Narrator's apartment, he moves into Tyler's decrepit house. They become friends and start an underground fight club in a bar basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her.\n\nThe Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows the fight club, attracting new members, including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing vandalism to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator's apartment and then goes missing. Bob is killed by the police during a mission, prompting the Narrator to attempt to stop the project and look for Tyler. Discovering the project's nationwide reach and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and other people, he realizes he and Tyler are split personalities.\n\nLearning that Project Mayhem plans to erase debt records by blowing up the headquarters of credit-card companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. The Narrator shoots himself in the mouth, killing Tyler. Marla arrives and she and the Narrator hold hands as they watch the targeted buildings collapse.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Edward Norton as the Narrator. He adopts a number of aliases while attending support groups.\n- Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden\n- Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer\n- Meat Loaf as Robert \"Bob\" Paulson\n- Jared Leto as Angel Face, a young Fight Club recruit and member of Project Mayhem.\n- Holt McCallany as the Mechanic\n- Zach Grenier as Richard Chesler, the Narrator's boss.\n- Eion Bailey as Ricky\n- Peter Iacangelo as Lou\n- Thom Gossom Jr. as Detective Stern\n\n## Themes\n\nFor academic interpretations of the film, see .\n\nWe're designed to be hunters and we're in a society of shopping. There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore. In that societal emasculation this everyman [the Narrator] is created.\n\nFincher said Fight Club was a coming of age film, like the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an \"everyman\"; the character is identified in the script as \"Jack\", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator's background, \"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \"kill\" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.\n\nThe character is a 1990s inverse of the Graduate archetype: \"a guy who does not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained, \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\" While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.\n\nScreenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a romantic comedy, explaining, \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\" The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.\n\nWe decided early on that I would start to starve myself as the film went on, while [Brad Pitt] would lift and go to tanning beds; he would become more and more idealized as I wasted away.\n\nThe Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler. He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful, though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires \"real experiences\" of actual fights like the Narrator at first, he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems. His impulsive nature, representing the id, is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing; he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps. The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves.\n\nFight Club examines Generation X angst as \"the middle children of history\". Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had \"its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture\", and was told one could achieve \"spiritual happiness through home furnishing\". His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, \"It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.\" Pitt said, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.\"\n\nFight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to \"a generation of spectators\". A culture of advertising defines society's \"external signifiers of happiness\", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, \"We smash it ... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.\" Pitt explained the dissonance, \"I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.\"\n\nThe violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb. The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be \"cocooned\" in society. Norton believed the fighting strips away the \"fear of pain\" and \"the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth\", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience. Fincher said, \"I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution.\"\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nThe novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its publication, a Fox Searchlight Pictures book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000 Pictures, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000.\n\nZiskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. The book was also sent to David O. Russell, but he couldn't understand it. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for Fox. To repair his relationship with Fox, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of Fight Club.\n\n### Casting\n\nProducer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe. Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film Meet Joe Black, and the studio believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5 million.\n\nFor the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as Matt Damon to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt. Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Man on the Moon. He was cast in Runaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5 million for Fight Club. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job.\n\nIn January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast. The actors prepared by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking. Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.\n\nFincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo. While Fincher initially stated that she turned it down because she objected to the film's sexual content, in an interview in 2020, Garofalo revealed that she did accept the role, but was dropped because Norton believed she was poorly suited to it. Fincher pitched the role to Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. Love claimed that she was cast as Marla Singer, but was fired after she rejected Pitt's pitch for a film about her late husband, Kurt Cobain. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher felt she was too young. Sarah Michelle Gellar turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Finally, Fincher chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.\n\n### Writing\n\nWhen Uhls first encountered the novel, it was in the form of a manuscript, though it already had a publisher. In his interview he stated that he read it just for enjoyment and was blown away by it. He started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived the technique as \"hackneyed and trite\" at the time. When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice. He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly \"sad and pathetic\". Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.\n\nPalahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, \"If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.\" Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists. The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, \"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,\" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality. Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth.\n\nThe Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him, \"I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.\"\n\n### Filming\n\nStudio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of $23 million to finance the film, but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50 million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to $67 million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least $5 million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing. The final production budget was $63–65 million.\n\nThe fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to \"go full out\" to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, inspired by the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for \"wet sweat\". Meat Loaf, who plays a fight club member who has \"bitch tits\", wore a 90-pound (40 kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts. He also wore eight-inch (20 cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.\n\nFilming lasted 138 days from July to December 1998, during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film. The locations were in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA. Overall, production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room, \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\"\n\n### Cinematography\n\nFincher used the Super 35 format to film Fight Club since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father Jordan Cronenweth had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film Alien 3, but left midway through production due to Parkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films Seven and The Game, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for Fight Club.\n\nFincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\". The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction. Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"smack-fiend patina\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.\n\nThe crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.\n\nFight Club was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.\n\nThe scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over-the-shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\". Fincher explained the subliminal frames, \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\"\n\nWhile Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on Fight Club, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be underexposed, Technicolor's ENR silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase the density of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nFincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on The Game, to create visual effects for Fight Club. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"mind's eye\" view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.\n\nThe opening scene in Fight Club that represents a brain's neural network in which the thought processes are initiated by the Narrator's fear impulse. The network was mapped using an L-system and drawn out by a medical illustrator.\n\nThe film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse. The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999. Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system, and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process.\n\nOther visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100 photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen months.\n\nMidway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue mark—nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film—to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained, \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\"\n\n### Score\n\nFincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing film scores would be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued Radiohead, but the singer, Thom Yorke, declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their 1997 album OK Computer. Fincher instead commissioned the breakbeat producing duo Dust Brothers, who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer Michael Simpson explained the setup, \"Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that.\" The climax and end credits feature the song \"Where Is My Mind?\" by Pixies.\n\n## Release\n\n### Marketing\n\nFilming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare Fight Club for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film. Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response, \"So many incidences of Fight Club were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.\" Nevertheless, Fight Club was originally slated to be released in July 1999, but was later changed to August 6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process. Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year.\n\nMarketing executives at Fox Searchlight Pictures faced difficulties in marketing Fight Club and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Federation broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film. Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to Fight Club's lukewarm box office performance in the United States.\n\n### Theatrical run\n\nThe studio held Fight Club's world premiere at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999. For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross between US$13 million and US$15 million in its opening weekend. Fight Club opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October 15, 1999, and earned US$11 million in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend. The film ranked first at the weekend box office, beating Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale. The gender mix of audiences for Fight Club, argued to be \"the ultimate anti-date flick\", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations. Over the second weekend, Fight Club dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning US$6.3 million. In its original theatrical run, the film grossed US$37 million in the United States and Canada, and US$63.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of US$100.9 million. (With subsequent re-releases, the film's worldwide gross increased to $101.2 million.) The underwhelming North American performance of Fight Club soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification reviewed Fight Club for its November 12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving \"an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp\". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that Fight Club contained \"dangerously instructive information\" and could \"encourage anti-social (behavior)\". The board decided, \"The film as a whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the anti-social behaviour that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels.\" The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007. In February 2024, in advance of a theatrical re-release, the BBFC lowered the classification from 18 to 15.\n\n### Home media\n\nFincher supervised the composition of the DVD packaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2000, in both one and two-disc editions. The movie disc included four commentary tracks, while the bonus disc contained behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, theater safety PSAs, the promotional music video \"This is Your Life\", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. Fincher worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher's vision, \"The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it.\" The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title \"Fight Club\" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, \"We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside.\" Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design, \"From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.\" It was the first DVD release to feature the THX Optimode.\n\nFight Club won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of \"The 50 Essential DVDs\", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical picture-and-audio quality. When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests. The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years, making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio's history, in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals. With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release, Fight Club generated a US$10 million profit for the studio.\n\nThe Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000 and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very few Dolby Digital Surround EX soundtracks released on LD. The VHS edition was released on October 31, 2000, as a part of 20th Century Fox's \"Premiere Series\" line. It includes a featurette after the film, \"Behind the Brawl\".\n\nFight Club was released on Blu-ray in the United States on November 17, 2009. Five graffiti artists were commissioned to create 30 pieces of art for the packaging, encompassing urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art. The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the Fight Club menu screen. Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.\n\nAn online release in China from Tencent censored the bomb blasts at the end and replaced the ending with a message that Project Mayhem was thwarted, with Tyler Durden being arrested by law enforcement and placed in an insane asylum until 2012, adapting the ending of the original Fight Club novel. Weeks later, Tencent released a version of the film restoring 11 of the 12 minutes that had previously been cut. The novel's author Chuck Palahniuk believed the censored version partially restored the book's ending.\n\nIn October 2024, Fincher confirmed he would oversee a 4K remaster of the film.\n\n## Critical reception\n\nCineaste's Gary Crowdus summarized the critical reception at the time, \"Many critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.\" He wrote of the negative opinion, \"While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.\" When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, \"Many loved and hated it in equal measures.\" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction, \"It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.\" Although the film's makers called Fight Club \"an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,\" some critics called it \"irresponsible and appalling.\" Writing for The Australian, Christopher Goodwin stated, \"Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.\"\n\nJanet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of \"contemporary manhood\", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave Fight Club two stars out of four, calling it \"visceral and hard-edged\", but also \"a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy\", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as \"trickery\". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was \"beloved by most, not by me\". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that \"[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.\" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an \"invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz\", but that it eventually became \"explosively silly\". Newsweek's David Ansen described Fight Club as \"an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload\" and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the mise en scène as dark and damp: \"It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry.\" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the \"conventionally gimmicky\" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting.\n\nThe film review website Metacritic surveyed 36 critics and assessed 24 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed, and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 67 out of 100, which it said indicated \"generally favorable reviews\". The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 185 critics and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 149 as positive and 36 as negative. For the subset of reviews that had scores, it determined an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. It gave the film a score of 81% and summarized the critical consensus, \"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride.\"\n\n## Accolades\n\nFight Club was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to The Matrix. Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress. The Online Film Critics Society also nominated Fight Club for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls). Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed Fight Club as one of the top ten films of 1999. The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to Notting Hill.\n\n## Legacy and cultural impact\n\nFight Club was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 films Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, and Three Kings, Fight Club was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology. After Fight Club's theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy \"perennial\" fame. The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown.\n\nFollowing Fight Club's release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" was started in Menlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop on the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \"Project Mayhem\".\n\nFight Club had a significant impact on evangelical Christianity, in the areas of Christian discipleship and masculinity. A number of churches called their cell groups \"fight clubs\" with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to \"beat up the flesh and believe the gospel of grace\". Some churches, especially Mars Hill Church in Seattle, whose pastor Mark Driscoll was obsessed with the film, picked up the film's emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on \"his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.\"\n\nA Fight Club video game was released by Vivendi Universal Games in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, Game Informer, and IGN. The video game Jet Set Radio, initially released in 2000 for Sega's Dreamcast console, was inspired by the film's anti-establishment themes.\n\nIn 2003, Fight Club was listed as one of the \"50 Best Guy Movies of All Time\" by Men's Journal. In 2004 and 2006, Fight Club was voted by Empire readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively. Total Film ranked Fight Club as \"The Greatest Film of our Lifetime\" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary. In 2007, Premiere selected Tyler Durden's line, \"The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,\" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time. In 2008, readers of Empire ranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. Empire also identified Fight Club as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.\n\nIn 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring Fight Club were released. Ferris Club was a mash-up of Fight Club and the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, \"claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic\". The second video, Jane Austen's Fight Club, also gained popularity online as a mash-up of Fight Club's fighting rules and the characters created by 19th-century novelist Jane Austen.\n\n\n\nThis reformatted article maintains the original content while clearly tagging the relevant sections according to the specified attributes from the ADT.",

The film is directed by Ron Howard based on a screenplay by Akiva Goldsman, who adapted the 1998 biography by Sylvia Nasar. In addition to Crowe, the film's cast features Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, and Christopher Plummer in supporting roles. The story begins in Nash's days as a brilliant but asocial mathematics graduate student at Princeton University. After Nash accepts secretive work in cryptography, he becomes liable to a larger conspiracy and begins to question his reality.\n\nA Beautiful Mind was released theatrically in the United States on December 21, 2001 by Universal Pictures and internationally by DreamWorks Pictures. It received generally positive reviews and went on to gross over $313 million worldwide, and won four Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director (Ron Howard), Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress (Jennifer Connelly). It was also nominated for Best Actor, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score.\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1947, John Nash arrives at Princeton University as a co-recipient, with Martin Hansen, of the Carnegie Scholarship for Mathematics. He meets fellow math and science graduate students Sol, Ainsley, and Bender, and his roommate Charles Herman, a literature student.\n\nDetermined to publish an original idea of his own, Nash is inspired when he and his classmates discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success, which leads him to develop a new concept of governing dynamics. His theory earns him an appointment at MIT where he chooses Sol and Bender over Hansen to join him.\n\nIn 1953, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to decipher encrypted enemy telecommunications. Bored with his work at MIT, he is recruited by the mysterious William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense with a classified assignment: to identify hidden patterns in magazines and newspapers to thwart a Soviet plot. He is given an implanted diode that gives him a passcode to access a drop spot at a mansion. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive with his work and grows paranoid.\n\nNash falls in love with a student, Alicia Larde, and they eventually marry. After a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, Nash tries to quit his assignment but is forced to continue. While delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University, Nash believes Soviet agents are pursuing him and is forcibly sedated. He awakens to a psychiatric facility under the care of Dr. Rosen.\n\nDr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee (niece of Charles), and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia, Sol and Bender investigate her husband's study, which shows various news and magazine clippings. Alicia uncovers the stack of unopened \"classified documents\" from the drop point and brings them to Nash, revealing the truth of his assignment. Overcome with shock, Nash slices his arm open to uncover the diode, which doesn't exist. Nash is given a course of insulin shock therapy and eventually released. Frustrated with the side effects of his antipsychotic medication, he secretly stops taking it. He encounters Parcher, who urges him to continue his assignment in a shed near his home.\n\nIn 1956, Alicia discovers Nash has relapsed and rushes home. She finds that Nash had left their infant son in the running bathtub, convinced \"Charles\" was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash accidentally hits her and the baby, believing he's saving them from Parcher. As Alicia flees with the baby, Nash realizes that all of them have looked the same ever since he first encountered them, and concludes they must be hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen's advice, Nash chooses not to be hospitalized again, believing he can deal with his symptoms himself with Alicia's support.\n\nNash returns to Princeton, approaching his old rival Hansen, now head of the mathematics department, who allows him to work out of the library and audit classes. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations and, by the late 1970s, is allowed to teach again. In 1994, Nash is awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on game theory and is honored by his fellow professors. At the Stockholm ceremony, he dedicates the prize to his wife. Nash reencounters Charles, Marcee, and Parcher after the ceremony, but ignores them as he, Alicia, and their son leave.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Russell Crowe as John Nash\n- Jennifer Connelly as Alicia Nash\n- Ed Harris as William Parcher\n- Christopher Plummer as Dr. Rosen\n- Paul Bettany as Charles Herman\n- Adam Goldberg as Richard Sol\n- Josh Lucas as Martin Hansen\n- Anthony Rapp as Bender\n- Jason Gray-Stanford as Ainsley Neilson\n- Judd Hirsch as Hellinger\n- Austin Pendleton as Thomas King\n- Vivien Cardone as Marcee Herman\n- Killian, Christian, and Daniel Coffinet-Crean as Baby\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nA Beautiful Mind was the second schizophrenia-themed film that Ron Howard had planned to direct. The first, Laws of Madness, would have been based on the true story of schizophrenic Michael Laudor, who overcame difficult odds to graduate from Yale Law School. Howard purchased the rights to Laudor's life story for $1.5 million in 1995 and had Brad Pitt slated to play the lead role. However, after Laudor killed his fiancée in 1998 during a psychotic episode, plans for the movie were cancelled.[3][4]\n\nAfter producer Brian Grazer first read an excerpt of Sylvia Nasar's 1998 book A Beautiful Mind in Vanity Fair magazine, he immediately purchased the rights to the film. Grazer later said that many A-list directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, his long-time professional partner.[5]\n\nGrazer met with many screenwriters, mostly consisting of \"serious dramatists\", but he chose Akiva Goldsman because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to avoid having viewers understand they are viewing an alternative reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their understanding and to mimic how Nash comprehended his experiences. Howard agreed to direct the film based on the first draft. He asked Goldsman to emphasize the love story of Nash and his wife; she was critical to his ability to continue living at home.[6]\n\nDave Bayer, a professor of mathematics at Barnard College, Columbia University,[7] was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. For the scene where Nash has to teach a calculus class and gives them a complicated problem to keep them busy, Bayer chose a problem physically unrealistic but mathematically very rich, in keeping with Nash as \"someone who really doesn't want to teach the mundane details, who will home in on what's really interesting\". Bayer received a cameo role as a professor who lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the film's end.[8]\n\nGreg Cannom was chosen to create the makeup effects for A Beautiful Mind, specifically the age progression of the characters. Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on The Insider. Howard had also worked with Cannom on Cocoon. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate \"Older Nash\" stage. The production team originally decided that the makeup department would age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup was used to push his look to resemble the facial features of John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate skin and be used for overlapping applications; this shortened make-up application time from eight to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with several dentures to give him a slight overbite in the film.[9]\n\nHoward and Grazer chose frequent collaborator James Horner to score the film because they knew of his communication ability. Howard said, regarding Horner, \"it's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director\". A running discussion between the director and the composer was about high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions and more akin to a kaleidoscope, in that the ideas evolve and change. After the film's first screening, Horner told Howard: \"I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems\". He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer Charlotte Church to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a \"purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument\" but also a vibrato to maintain the humanity of the voice.[10]\n\nThe film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the Princeton University campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's hallucinations should always be introduced first audibly and then visually. This provides a clue for the audience and establishes the hallucinations from Nash's point of view. The historic John Nash had only auditory hallucinations. The filmmakers developed a technique to represent Nash's mental epiphanies. Mathematicians described to them such moments as a sense of \"the smoke clearing\", \"flashes of light\" and \"everything coming together\", so the filmmakers used a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work.[11] Two night shots were done at Fairleigh Dickinson University's campus in Florham Park, New Jersey, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom.[12] Portions of the film set at Harvard were filmed at Manhattan University.[13] (Harvard has turned down most requests for on-location filming ever since the filming of Love Story (1970), which caused significant physical damage to trees on campus.)[14]\n\nTom Cruise was considered for the lead role.[15][16] Howard ultimately cast Russell Crowe. For the role of Alicia Nash, Rachel Weisz was offered the role but turned it down. Charlize Theron and Julia Ormond auditioned for the role. According to Ron Howard, the four finalists for the role of Alicia were Ashley Judd, Claire Forlani, Mary McCormack and Jennifer Connelly, with Connelly winning the role. Before the casting of Connelly, Hilary Swank and Salma Hayek were also candidates for the part.\n\n### Writing\n\nThe film's narrative differs considerably from the events of Nash's life in many respects, as filmmakers used artistic license to create a compelling film. Most prominently, few of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, correspond directly to actual people.[17] A Beautiful Mind has been criticized for neglecting factual events, but the filmmakers said they never intended a literal representation of his life.[18] The PBS documentary A Brilliant Madness tried to portray his life more accurately.[19]\n\nOne difficulty was finding a method to visually depict Nash's mental illness.[20] In reality, Nash never had visual hallucinations: Charles Herman (the \"roommate\"), Marcee Herman and William Parcher (the Defense agent) are a scriptwriter's invention. Sylvia Nasar said that the filmmakers \"invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story\".[21] Nash spent his years between Princeton and MIT as a consultant for the RAND Corporation in California, but in the film he is portrayed as having worked for the Department of Defense at the Pentagon instead. His handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers.[11]\n\nThe Nash equilibrium discussion was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, Nash has schizophrenic hallucinations while he is in graduate school, but in his life he did not have this experience until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's alleged homosexual experiences at RAND.[21] Nash's biographer notes he was arrested in a 1954 police sting operation targeting gay men in Santa Monica and subsequently lost his security clearance, but charges were dropped and there is no evidence Nash was ever sexually active with men.[22] Furthermore, both Nash and his wife denied these encounters occurred.[23] Nash fathered a son, John David Stier (born June 19, 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (1921–2005), a nurse whom he abandoned when she told him of her pregnancy.[24] The film did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until after Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1994 that they renewed their relationship. In 1970, Alicia allowed him to live with her as a boarder. They remarried in 2001.[25]\n\nNash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but no such lab exists. Instead, he was appointed as C. L. E. Moore instructor at MIT, and later as a professor.[26] The film furthermore does not touch on the revolutionary work of John Nash in differential geometry and partial differential equations, such as the Nash embedding theorem or his proof of Hilbert's nineteenth problem, work which he did in his time at MIT and for which he was given the Abel Prize in 2015. The so-called pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is fictitious.[11][27] The film has Nash saying in 1994: \"I take the newer medications\". He did not take any medication from 1970 onward, something highlighted in Nasar's biography. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because they worried that the film would be criticized for suggesting that all people with schizophrenia can overcome their illness without medication.[11] In addition, Nash never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize.\n\n### Soundtrack\n\n## Release\n\nA Beautiful Mind received a limited release on December 13, 2001, and received positive reviews. Crowe received wide acclaim for his performance. It was later released in the United States on December 21, 2001.\n\nA Beautiful Mind was released on VHS and DVD, in wide- and full-screen editions, in North America on June 25, 2002.[28] The DVD set includes audio commentaries, deleted scenes, and documentaries.[29] The film was also released on Blu-ray in North America on January 25, 2011.[30]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nDuring the five-day weekend of the limited release, A Beautiful Mind opened at the #12 spot at the box office,[31] peaking at the #2 spot following the wide release.[32] The film went on to gross $170,742,341 in the United States and Canada and $313,542,341 worldwide.[2]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, A Beautiful Mind holds an approval rating of 74% based on 214 reviews and an average score of 7.20/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"The well-acted A Beautiful Mind is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness.\"[33] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[34] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[35]\n\nRoger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars.[36] Mike Clark of USA Today gave three-and-a-half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance, calling it a welcome follow-up to Howard's previous film, 2000’s How the Grinch Stole Christmas.[37] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post found the film to be \"one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies\".[38] The portrayal of mathematics in the film was praised by the mathematics community, including John Nash himself.[8]\n\nJohn Sutherland of The Guardian noted the film's biopic distortions, but said that \"Howard pulls off an extraordinary trick in A Beautiful Mind by seducing the audience into Nash's paranoid world. We may not leave the cinema with A-level competence in game theory, but we do get a glimpse into what it feels like to be mad - and not know it.\"[39]\n\nWriting in the Los Angeles Times, Lisa Navarrette criticized the casting of Jennifer Connelly as Alicia Nash as an example of whitewashing. Alicia Nash was born in El Salvador and had an accent not portrayed in the film.[40]\n\nShailee Koranne of CBC Arts argued that the film presents an unrealistic or inappropriate depiction of the disorder schizophrenia, which the protagonist John Nash suffers from, stating that it places too much emphasis on “fixing” the disorder.[41]\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\n| Award                                             | Category                                                                           | Recipient                                                                                                                                                                           | Result       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Academy Awards[42]                                | Best Picture                                                                       | Brian Grazer and Ron Howard                                                                                                                                                         | Won          |\n| Academy Awards[42]                                | Best Director                                                                      | Ron Howard                                                                                                                                                                          | Won          |\n| Academy Awards[42]                                | Best Actor                                                                         | Russell Crowe                                                                                                                                                                       | Nominated    |\n| Academy Awards[42]                                | Best Supporting Actress                                                            | Jennifer Connelly                                                                                                                                                                   | Won          |\n| Academy Awards[42]                                | Best Screenplay – Based on Material Previously Produced or Published               | Akiva Goldsman                                                                                                                                                                      | Won          |\n| Academy Awards[42]                                | Best Film Editing                                                                  | Mike Hill and Daniel P.

Retrieved July 9, 2012. Contrary to widespread references to Nash's \"numerous homosexual liaisons\", he was not gay. While he had several emotionally intense relationships with other men when he was in his early 20s, I never interviewed anyone who claimed, much less provided evidence, that Nash ever had sex with another man. Nash was arrested in a police trap in a public lavatory in Santa Monica in 1954, at the height of the McCarthy hysteria.

The film stars an ensemble cast consisting of Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Abigail Breslin, and Alan Arkin, all of whom play members of a dysfunctional family taking the youngest (Breslin) to compete in a child beauty pageant. The film tackles themes of family, depression, self-acceptance, and finding meaning in absurd conditions. It was produced by Big Beach Films on a budget of US$8 million.[1][3] Filming began on June 6, 2005, and took place over 30 days in Arizona and Southern California.\n\nThe film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2006, and its distribution rights were bought by Fox Searchlight Pictures for one of the biggest deals made in the history of the festival.[4] The film had a limited release in the United States on July 26, 2006, and expanded to a wider release starting on August 18.[1]\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine was a box office success, earning $101 million. It garnered critical praise for its performances (particularly Breslin’s and Arkin’s), as well as for its directing, screenplay and humor. It earned four nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Arndt and Arkin won Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor, respectively, and Breslin was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. It also won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n## Plot\n\nSheryl Hoover is a mother of two living in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her husband Richard is an aspiring motivational speaker and life coach. Dwayne, Sheryl's Nietzsche-reading teenage son from a previous marriage, has taken a vow of silence until he accomplishes his dream of becoming a fighter pilot. Sheryl's older brother Frank, a gay scholar of Proust, is living with the family after having attempted suicide. Richard's foul-mouthed father Edwin is also living with the family after being evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin. Olive, Richard and Sheryl's young daughter, is an aspiring beauty queen coached by Edwin.\n\nOlive learns she has qualified for the \"Little Miss Sunshine\" beauty pageant being held in Redondo Beach, California, in two days. Richard, Sheryl, and Edwin want to support her, and Frank and Dwayne cannot be left alone, so the whole family attends. Due to financial constraints, they go on an 800-mile (1,300 km) road trip in their yellow Volkswagen van. Family tensions play out along the way, amidst the aging van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push it until it is moving at about 20 mph (32 km/h) before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself, which leads to the family being pulled over by a state trooper.\n\nThe 1979 Volkswagen Type 2 used in the movie, here at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout the trip, the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discovers their need for each other's support. Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank embarrassingly encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt. Edwin fatally overdoses on heroin. When the grief counselor refuses to let the family leave his corpse at the hospital while they go to the pageant and return later, they smuggle it into the van, almost getting caught by the police. During the final leg of the trip, Dwayne discovers he is colorblind, meaning he cannot become a pilot. This revelation prompts him to finally break his silence and shout his disdain for his family, though he apologizes after Olive calms him with a hug.\n\nAfter a frantic race against the clock, with the body beginning to stink in the back, the family arrives at the pageant hotel. Sheryl prepares Olive for her performance while Richard is looking into arrangements for Edwin's body. As the pageant begins, Richard and Dwayne realize that the other contestants are slim, sexualized pre-teen girls who perform elaborate dance numbers with great panache. Knowing that the amateur Olive is certain to be humiliated, they try to talk her out of performing. Sheryl insists that they \"let Olive be Olive\", and Olive goes on stage.\n\nThe hitherto-unseen dance routine Edwin had taught Olive is revealed to be a striptease performed to the Rocasound remix of Rick James' \"Super Freak\". Olive's performance horrifies and angers most of the audience and organizers, who demand she be removed from the stage. However, before they can do so the members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage and dance alongside her to show their support.\n\nThe family is later released from the hotel's security office on the condition that Olive never enters a beauty pageant in California again. Piling into the van with the horn still honking, they happily smash through the barrier of the hotel's toll booth and begin their trip back home to Albuquerque.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Greg Kinnear as Richard\n- Toni Collette as Sheryl\n- Steve Carell as Frank\n- Paul Dano as Dwayne\n- Abigail Breslin as Olive\n- Alan Arkin as Edwin\n- Bryan Cranston as Stan Grossman\n- Beth Grant as Pageant Official Jenkins\n- Wallace Langham as Kirby\n- Matt Winston as Pageant MC\n- Julio Oscar Mechoso as Mechanic\n- Paula Newsome as Linda\n- Dean Norris as State Trooper McCleary\n- Mary Lynn Rajskub as Pageant Assistant Pam\n- Mel Rodriguez as Officer Martinez\n\n## Production\n\n### Casting\n\nYou start off with all these people living their separate lives and the climax of the movie is them all jumping up onstage together. So the story is really about these families starting separately and ending together.\n\nWhen choosing the cast for the film, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris were assisted by casting directors Kim Davis and Justine Baddeley who had worked with them on previous music videos.[6] Davis and Baddeley traveled to \"every English-speaking country\"[6] to search for the actress to portray Olive Hoover, and they finally chose actress Abigail Breslin through an audition when she was six. Paul Dano was cast as Dwayne two years before production began and in preparation for portraying his character, spent a few days taking his own vow of silence.[7]\n\nThe role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was originally written for Bill Murray, and there was also studio pressure for Robin Williams.[8] The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: \"When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But when we met with him and talked to him about the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he was right on the same page with us.\"[6] Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood.[9] Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.[10]\n\n### Script and development\n\nThe script was written by Michael Arndt and was originally about an East Coast road trip from Maryland to Florida, but was shifted to a journey from New Mexico to California because of budget issues.[11] Arndt started the script on May 23, 2000, and completed the first rough draft by May 26.[12] He had initially planned on shooting the film himself by raising several thousand dollars and using a camcorder.[13] Instead, he gave the screenplay to producers Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger who teamed up with Deep River Productions to find a potential director.[14] Arndt included the character Stan Grossman (here played by Bryan Cranston) as a tribute to the film Fargo.[15]\n\nThe producers met directors Dayton and Faris while producing Election and in turn gave the script to them to read in 2001. The directors commented later on the script stating: \"This film really struck a chord. We felt like it was written for us.\"[8] The script was purchased from first-time screenwriter Arndt for $250,000 by Marc Turtletaub, one of the film's producers, on December 21, 2001.[16] Yerxa and Berger remained as producers as they were responsible for finding the directors and cinematographer, assisting in the ending re-shoot, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival.[17]\n\nThe film was pitched to several studios, and the only interested studio was Focus Features, who wanted to film it in Canada.[8] After the studio attempted to have the film be centered on the character Richard Hoover, and Arndt disagreed, he was fired and replaced by another writer.[5] The new writer added several scenes, including Richard's confrontation with the character who dismisses his motivational technique business.[18] A corporate change brought in a new studio head and Arndt was rehired when the new writer left after four weeks of rewriting the script.[19] After two years of pre-production, Focus Features dropped the film in August 2004. Marc Turtletaub paid $400,000 to Focus Features to buy back the rights to the film and for development costs.[8] He also paid for the $8 million budget, allowing Little Miss Sunshine to then be filmed.[20]\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 6, 2005.[21] Filming took place over 30 days in Arizona and southern California, with scenes shot in keeping with the chronological order of the script.[6][17] Arndt re-wrote the ending to the film six weeks before the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, and this was filmed in December 2005.[22] The film was dedicated to Rebecca Annitto, the niece of producer Peter Saraf and an extra in scenes set in the diner and the convenience store, who was killed in a car accident on September 14, 2005.[23]\n\n#### Volkswagen T2 Microbus\n\nFive modified vans were used during filming to capture various angles of the characters, including this one through the windshield.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen writing the script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus to use for the road trip based on his experience with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: \"I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle are you going to put them in? And [the] VW bus just seems logical, just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody.\"[5] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques.[24] Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers.[24] During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming.[25] Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.[19][26][27]\n\nIn an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: \"I was going like 50 miles an hour [80 km/h] in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side airbags. Basically, you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made.\"[28] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day.[28] For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said.[28][29] On July 25, 2006, Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.[30]\n\n#### Pageant\n\nTo make Abigail Breslin's character (centre) appear larger than the other girls, she wore a padded suit. Much of the equipment and costumes exhibited during the pageant were provided by actual contestants' parents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrior to writing the script, Arndt read in a newspaper about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking to a group of high school students and saying \"If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers. I despise them.\" As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: \"And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude ... I wanted to ... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down ... So to a degree, a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through.\"[5] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: \"As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up ...\"[31] All the girls acting as participants in the beauty pageant, except Abigail Breslin, were veterans of real beauty pageants. They looked the same and performed the same acts as they had in their real-life pageants.[32] To prepare for filming, the directors attended several pageants in Southern California and met with a coordinator to learn more about the pageant process.[33] A mother of a contestant in the film claimed that the film overplayed practices that the contestants go through: \"Most pageants aren't quite like that, with shaving the girls' legs, spraying them with fake tans and putting on so much makeup.\"[33]\n\nWhen Focus Features initially wanted to film in Canada, the directors opposed it, believing the costs of flying all of the pageant girls and their families would be excessive.[8] The contestants and their families instead spent two weeks filming in a hotel in Ventura with most of the equipment and costumes being provided by the contestants' parents.[33][34] To make Breslin's character the \"plump\" figure as shown in the film, she had to wear a padded suit during filming.[35] For Olive's final scene involving her dancing routine, Breslin spent two weeks preparing with a choreographer.[28]\n\n## Music\n\n\"It was very important for us to find the right sound for this movie. We hoped that we could find it before we actually filmed the picture because that's how we worked for years and we've found that music informs our choices.\"\n\n### Score\n\nThe score for Little Miss Sunshine was written by the Denver band DeVotchKa and composer Mychael Danna.[36] Performed by DeVotchKa, much of the music was adapted from their pre-existing songs, such as \"How It Ends\", which became \"The Winner Is\", \"The Enemy Guns\" and \"You Love Me\" from the album How It Ends, and \"La Llorona\" from Una Volta.\n\nDirectors Dayton and Faris were introduced to DeVotchKa's music after hearing the song \"You Love Me\" on Los Angeles' KCRW radio station.[37] The directors were so impressed with the music that they purchased iPods for cast members containing DeVotchKa albums.[38] Mychael Danna was brought in to help arrange the pre-existing material and collaborate with DeVotchKa on new material for the film. The Little Miss Sunshine score was not eligible for Academy Award consideration due to the percentage of material derived from already written DeVotchKa songs.[39] The DeVotchka song \"Til the End of Time\" received a nomination for a 2006 Satellite Award as \"Best Original Song\".[40] Both DeVotchKa and Danna received 2007 Grammy nominations for their work on the soundtrack.[38]\n\n### Soundtrack\n\n| Little Miss Sunshine (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)   | Little Miss Sunshine (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Soundtrack album by Various Artists                         | Soundtrack album by Various Artists                         |\n| Released                                                    | July 11, 2006 (2006-7-11)                                   |\n| Genre                                                       | Soundtrack                                                  |\n| Length                                                      | 46:31                                                       |\n| Label                                                       | Lakeshore Records                                           |\n| Producer                                                    | Various Artists                                             |\n\n| Review scores        | Review scores   |\n|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Source               | Rating          |\n| Allmusic             | [41]            |\n| Entertainment Weekly | (A−)[42]        |\n| Empire               | [43]            |\n| SoundtrackNet        | [44]            |\n\nThe soundtrack reached No. 42 on the \"Top Independent Albums\" list and No. 24 on \"Top Soundtracks\" in the U.S. for 2006.[45] It contains two songs by Sufjan Stevens (\"No Man's Land\" and \"Chicago\"), and songs by Tony Tisdale (\"Catwalkin'\") and Rick James (\"Super Freak\").[46][41] Two additional songs in the film that were written by Gordon Pogoda—\"Let It Go\" and \"You've Got Me Dancing\" (the latter of which he co-wrote with Barry Upton)—are featured during the pageant scenes near the end of the film.[47] \"Super Freak\", the source music danced to by Olive during the pageant competition, was introduced during post-production by a suggestion from the music supervisor.[48] Arndt's screenplay had called for Prince's song \"Peach\"; during filming, the ZZ Top song \"Gimme All Your Lovin'\" was used.[48] For the film, \"Super Freak\" was remixed by record producer Sebastian Arocha Morton (known professionally as ROCAsound).\n\n#### Track listing\n\n| No.           | Title                            | Writer(s)      | Length   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1.            | \"The Winner Is\"                  | DeVotchKa      | 3:04     |\n| 2.            | \"Til the End of Time\"            | DeVotchKa      | 3:56     |\n| 3.            | \"You Love Me\"                    | DeVotchKa      | 4:02     |\n| 4.            | \"First Push\"                     | DeVotchKa      | 1:05     |\n| 5.            | \"No Man's Land\"                  | Sufjan Stevens | 4:47     |\n| 6.            | \"Let's Go\"                       | DeVotchKa      | 3:21     |\n| 7.            | \"No One Gets Left Behind\"        | DeVotchKa      | 1:14     |\n| 8.            | \"Chicago\"                        | Sufjan Stevens | 6:07     |\n| 9.            | \"We're Gonna Make It\"            | DeVotchKa      | 2:32     |\n| 10.           | \"Do You Think There's a Heaven\"  | DeVotchKa      | 1:23     |\n| 11.           | \"Catwalkin'\"                     | Tony Tisdale   | 1:38     |\n| 12.           | \"Super Freak (Rocasound Revamp)\" | Rick James     | 4:13     |\n| 13.           | \"La Llorona\"                     | DeVotchKa      | 3:24     |\n| 14.           | \"How It Ends\"                    | DeVotchKa      | 5:39     |\n| Total length: | Total length:                    | Total length:  | 46:31    |\n\n## Release\n\n### Sundance Film Festival\n\nThe film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing the film's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 20, 2006, several studios placed bids; Fox Searchlight Pictures won, offering $10.5 million, plus 10% of all the gross revenues.[8] The deal occurred less than a day after the premiere and was one of the biggest deals made in the history of the festival.[49][50] The previous year's festival had the film Hustle &amp; Flow receive $9 million from Paramount Classics, and in 1999, Happy, Texas received $10 million from Miramax Films.[50][51]\n\n### Box office\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine initially opened in seven theaters in the U.S. in its first week, earning $498,796.[52] On July 29, 2006, the first Saturday after its initial limited release, Little Miss Sunshine earned a $20,335 per-theater average gross.[53] It had the highest per-theater average gross of all the films shown in the United States every day for the first 21 days of its release, until being surpassed by the IMAX film Deep Sea 3D on August 15.[54] In its third week of release Little Miss Sunshine entered the list of top ten highest grossing American films for the week. It remained in the top ten until the 11th week of release, when it dropped to 11th place.[52] The highest position it reached was third, which occurred in its fifth week of release. The largest number of theaters the film appeared in was 1,602.[52] Internationally, the film earned over $5 million in Australia, $3 million in Germany, $4 million in Spain, and $6 million combined in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta.[55] Little Miss Sunshine has had gross receipts of $59,891,098 in North America and $40,632,083 internationally for a total of $100,523,181.[1]\n\n### Home media\n\nThe DVD was released on December 19, 2006. It includes a dual-disc widescreen/full screen format, two commentary tracks, four alternate endings, and a music video by DeVotchKa. In its first week of release, DVD sales totaled $19,614,299 and it was the sixth-most sold DVD of the week.[56] By September 16, 2008, gross domestic DVD sales totaled $55,516,832.[56] Rentals of the film from its release through April 15, 2007, totalled $46.32 million.[57] The film was released on Blu-ray on February 10, 2009.[58] Then in 2010, it was released on a double movie DVD pack with Juno.[59]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Little Miss Sunshine received a 91% positive aggregate rating, based on 218 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Little Miss Sunshine succeeds thanks to a strong ensemble cast that includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, and Abigail Breslin, as well as a delightfully funny script.\"[60] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 80 out of 100, based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[61]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performances of  and  received widespread critical acclaim, earning them  nominations for  and  respectively, with Arkin  winning his category.\n\nMichael Medved gave Little Miss Sunshine four out of four, saying that \"... this startling and irresistible dark comedy counts as one of the very best films of the year ...\" and that directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the movie itself, and actors Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, and Steve Carell deserved Oscar nominations.[62] Joel Siegel issued an 'A' rating, saying that \"Orson Welles would have to come back to life for this not to make my year-end Top 10 list.\"[63] Stella Papamichael of BBC News called the film \"a winning blend of sophistication and silliness\".[64] USA Today's Claudia Puig commented on Breslin's depiction of Olive Hoover, \"If Olive had been played by any other little girl, she would not have affected us as mightily as it did.\"[65]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly labeled the film with a 'C' rating, calling the characters \"walking, talking catalogs of screenwriter index-card data\".[66] Jim Ridley of The Village Voice called the movie a \"rickety vehicle that travels mostly downhill\" and a \"Sundance clunker\".[67] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail criticized the film, stating \"Though Little Miss Sunshine is consistently contrived in its characters' too-cute misery, the conclusion, which is genuinely outrageous and uplifting, is almost worth the hype.\"[68] Anna Nimouse of National Review wrote that the film \"is praised as a 'feel-good' film, perhaps for moviegoers who like bamboo under their fingernails. If you are miserable, then Little Miss Sunshine is the film for you\".[69] Paste Magazine named it one of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000–2009), ranking it at No. 34.[70]\n\nRoger Ebert reflected on the film's themes, writing \"Little Miss Sunshine shows us a world in which there's a form, a brochure, a procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'\"[71] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: \"Little Miss Sunshine teaches us to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone prettier, smarter, or just plain luckier, but if we get up on that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine.\"[72]\n\n### Accolades\n\nAbigail Breslin promoting the film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 2007\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine was nominated for and won multiple awards from numerous film organizations and festivals. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and was awarded two at the 79th Academy Awards: Michael Arndt received \"Best Original Screenplay\" and Alan Arkin received \"Best Supporting Actor\".[73] In addition, the AFI Awards deemed it the \"Movie of the Year\", while the BAFTA Awards awarded it two awards out of six nominations with \"Best Screenplay\" for Arndt and \"Best Actor in a Supporting Role\" for Arkin.[74][75] The Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards,[76] Screen Actors Guild (SAG),[77] and Washington D.C. Area Film Critics[78] commended the film for its ensemble cast. Then 10-year-old Abigail Breslin was nominated for several Best Supporting Actress and Breakthrough Performance awards.\n\nThe Deauville Film Festival awarded the film the \"Grand Special Prize\" while the Palm Springs International Film Festival awarded it the \"Chairman's Vanguard Award\".[79][80] The Independent Spirit Awards awarded it four awards out of five nominations, including \"Best Feature\" and \"Best Director\".[81] The film's soundtrack was nominated for \"Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media\" at the Grammy Awards, but lost to Walk the Line.[82] The film also had multiple nominations at the MTV Movie Awards,[83] Satellite Awards,[84] Chicago Film Critics Association Awards,[85] and Golden Globe Awards,[86] among others.\n\n#### Number of producers controversy in Academy Awards\n\nThere was some controversy concerning how many producers should receive an award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their work in producing the film. In 1999, the Academy decided that up to a maximum of three producers are eligible to be included in an award for a film.[87] The rule was implemented to prevent numerous involved filmmakers to appear on stage when a film was receiving an award.[88] The Producers Guild of America (PGA) has not set a limit of producers that can be honored for a film.[89] In the case of Little Miss Sunshine, there were five producers (Marc Turtletaub, Peter Saraf, Albert Berger, Ron Yerxa, and David Friendly) and the Academy did not want to include Berger and Yerxa. The two producers were responsible for finding the script, introducing the directors to the other producers, choosing the cinematographer, assisting in the re-shoot of the ending, and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival.[17][90] The Academy acknowledged that the two were partners in the production process, but declared that only individual producers are recognized by the Academy. Deeming the two producers' work as a collective effort, the Academy refused to consider either Berger or Yerxa for the award.[87] Producer David Hoberman commented on the support for honoring all five producers, stating \"If there are five people actually involved in producing a movie, there's no reason why someone who's made a good enough film to be nominated for an Academy Award should be precluded from being rewarded for the work they did.\"[87] Film producer and author Lynda Obst who was affiliated with an Academy Award producer committee, also commented: \"By and large, five people don't make a movie. If this is an exception, then it's a sad situation. But you don't destroy a rule for an exception.\"[87]\n\nThe PGA had previously honored all five of the producers.[91] Albert Berger, reacting to the Academy's decision while at a panel for the film, stated \"No matter what the Academy decided, we produced this movie.\"[17] In June 2007, the Academy announced that they would allow exceptions for films that had more than three producers in the future, stating, \"The committee has the right, in what it determines to be a rare and extraordinary circumstance, to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee.\"[91]\n\n## Stage musical adaptation\n\nA musical based on the film, with music and lyrics by William Finn and book and direction by James Lapine, was workshopped at the Sundance Institute Theatre Lab at White Oak in Yulee, Florida October 25 through November 7, 2009.[92] It then premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse from February 15 through March 27, 2011.[93] The cast features Hunter Foster, Malcolm Gets, Georgi James, Dick Latessa, Jennifer Laura Thompson, and Taylor Trensch.[94][95]\n\nOn March 11, 2011, Gets left the show. Ensemble member Andrew Samonsky took over the role of Uncle Frank, and understudy Ryan Wagner took over the role of Joshua Rose until the show closed on March 27, 2011. The musical premiered at Second Stage Theatre on October 15, 2013 (previews), and officially on November 14, 2013. The production closed on December 15, 2013.[96] The cast features Hannah Rose Nordberg as Olive Hoover, Stephanie J. Block as Sheryl Hoover, Rory O'Malley as Frank Hoover, Wesley Taylor as Joshua Rose, Josh Lamon as Buddy, David Rasche as Grandpa Hoover, Jennifer Sanchez as Miss California and Logan Rowland as Dwayne Hoover.[97]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c d e \"Little Miss Sunshine\".

Her husband Richard is an aspiring motivational speaker and life coach. Dwayne, Sheryl's Nietzsche-reading teenage son from a previous marriage, has taken a vow of silence until he accomplishes his dream of becoming a fighter pilot. Sheryl's older brother Frank, a gay scholar of Proust, is living with the family after having attempted suicide. Richard's foul-mouthed father Edwin is also living with the family after being evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin. Olive, Richard and Sheryl's young daughter, is an aspiring beauty queen coached by Edwin.\n\n        Olive learns she has qualified for the \"Little Miss Sunshine\" beauty pageant being held in Redondo Beach, California, in two days. Richard, Sheryl, and Edwin want to support her, and Frank and Dwayne cannot be left alone, so the whole family attends. Due to financial constraints, they go on an 800-mile (1,300 km) road trip in their yellow Volkswagen van. Family tensions play out along the way, amidst the aging van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push it until it is moving at about 20 mph (32 km/h) before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself, which leads to the family being pulled over by a state trooper.\n\n        Throughout the trip, the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discovers their need for each other's support. Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank embarrassingly encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt. Edwin fatally overdoses on heroin. When the grief counselor refuses to let the family leave his corpse at the hospital while they go to the pageant and return later, they smuggle it into the van, almost getting caught by the police. During the final leg of the trip, Dwayne discovers he is colorblind, meaning he cannot become a pilot. This revelation prompts him to finally break his silence and shout his disdain for his family, though he apologizes after Olive calms him with a hug.\n\n        After a frantic race against the clock, with the body beginning to stink in the back, the family arrives at the pageant hotel. Sheryl prepares Olive for her performance while Richard is looking into arrangements for Edwin's body. As the pageant begins, Richard and Dwayne realize that the other contestants are slim, sexualized pre-teen girls who perform elaborate dance numbers with great panache. Knowing that the amateur Olive is certain to be humiliated, they try to talk her out of performing. Sheryl insists that they \"let Olive be Olive\", and Olive goes on stage.\n\n        The hitherto-unseen dance routine Edwin had taught Olive is revealed to be a striptease performed to the Rocasound remix of Rick James' \"Super Freak\". Olive's performance horrifies and angers most of the audience and organizers, who demand she be removed from the stage. However, before they can do so, the members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage and dance alongside her to show their support.\n\n        The family is later released from the hotel's security office on the condition that Olive never enters a beauty pageant in California again. Piling into the van with the horn still honking, they happily smash through the barrier of the hotel's toll booth and begin their trip back home to Albuquerque.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Greg Kinnear as Richard</Actor>\n        <Actor>Toni Collette as Sheryl</Actor>\n        <Actor>Steve Carell as Frank</Actor>\n        <Actor>Paul Dano as Dwayne</Actor>\n        <Actor>Abigail Breslin as Olive</Actor>\n        <Actor>Alan Arkin as Edwin</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n    \n    <Reception>\n        On Rotten Tomatoes, Little Miss Sunshine received a 91% positive aggregate rating, based on 218 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10.

The film stars Keir Gilchrist, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts, and Viola Davis.[3] It was released in the United States on October 8, 2010, and received generally positive reviews.\n\n## Plot\n\nContemplating suicide, depressed teenager Craig Gilner seeks help at a local hospital. After telling a doctor named Dr. Mahmoud that he needs immediate help, Craig is admitted for five days at the hospital's adult psychiatric floor, due to the temporary closure of the psychiatric floor for adolescents.\n\nCraig's hospitalization was spurred on by the stress of his academically competitive high school and upcoming summer program applications. He was also facing feelings of inferiority in the shadow of his best friend Aaron, and pressure from his father to succeed academically. At first, Craig is uncertain if he made the right choice to stay on the psychiatric floor, fearing his friends may find out where he is, particularly Nia, his crush and Aaron's girlfriend.\n\nThroughout his stay, Craig bonds with various patients in the psychiatric unit. Craig is introduced to Bobby (Zach Galifianakis), a patient who takes Craig under his wing. During a group discussion, Craig learns that Bobby is stressed about an upcoming interview, hoping to move to a group home. Bobby worries that the sweater he is wearing is all he has to wear for the interview, so Craig offers him one of his dad's dress shirts to wear.\n\nNoelle (Emma Roberts), a patient admitted for self-harm, is impressed by Craig's kindness, and leaves him a note to meet with her later on. They attend a painting session for patients together, where Craig paints a picture of an imaginary city map which he describes as \"like my own brain\". Bobby tells Craig he is a father of a little girl, and has attempted to kill himself six times. As Craig tries to help Bobby with his problems, Bobby, in turn, helps Craig gain the courage to ask out Noelle.\n\nOne night, Nia stops by the hospital to visit Craig, revealing that she and Aaron have broken up. Craig invites Nia to his room, where she tries to seduce him. However, they are interrupted by Craig's roommate, Muqtada, who has not left their shared room during his stay. As Nia runs out, Craig chases her, declaring he loves her, unaware that Noelle is standing behind him. Upset, Noelle storms off, leaving behind a self-portrait she had planned to give him.\n\nCraig eventually wins Noelle's forgiveness, and the pair briefly sneak out of the ward, onto the hospital roof. There, Noelle asks him out, and they kiss. Craig has an interview with the head physician, Dr. Minerva; he explains that he has realized that he wants to become an artist, and is thankful his problems aren't as bad as others.\n\nThat night, Craig asks the staff for a pizza party, so the patients can say goodbye to him and Bobby—both are being discharged the following day. Craig calls Aaron, asking him to bring a particular record. When Aaron arrives, he tells him that he and Nia are working out their problems and they hug. At the party, Craig plays the record of Egyptian music, bringing Muqtada out of his room. He tells Bobby they should meet again after they are discharged, which he considers, and Bobby thanks him for changing his future outlook.\n\nAfter Craig is discharged, he narrates a montage showing he has started dating Noelle, become better friends with Aaron and Nia, and begun pursuing his goal to become an artist. Craig has broken the news to his dad that he is not going to follow the path he intended for him, which his dad understands. Craig affirms that, while his stay didn't cure his condition, it significantly helped him, and he can get through the rest of his life with the help of his family and friends.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Keir Gilchrist as Craig Gilner\n- Emma Roberts as Noelle\n- Zach Galifianakis as Bobby\n- Viola Davis as Dr. Minerva\n- Zoë Kravitz as Nia\n- Thomas Mann as Aaron Fitzcarraldo\n- Aasif Mandvi as Dr. Mahmoud\n- Bernard White as Muqtada\n- Lauren Graham as Lynn Gilner\n- Jim Gaffigan as George Gilner\n- Matthew Maher as Humble\n- Adrian Martinez as Johnny\n- Jeremy Davies as Smitty\n- Willian Silvan as Willian\n- Mary Birdsong as Bobby's ex-wife\n- Novella Nelson as The Professor\n- Morgan Murphy as Joanie\n- Dana DeVestern as Alissa Gilner\n- Ethan Herschenfeld as Solomon (Acid Head)\n\n## Production\n\nNed Vizzini, writer of the novel, and Keir Gilchrist, leading actor in the film, at 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn May 2006, Paramount Pictures and MTV Films acquired the film rights to the novel. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were hired to adapt the screenplay.[4][5] The film was later placed in turnaround and bought by Focus Features.[1]\n\nProduction began in New York City on November 30, 2009.[3] Principal photography took about six weeks, ending on February 2, 2010.[6] Scenes taking place in the fictional Executive Pre-Professional High School were shot at Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn,[7] while Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn stood in for Argenon Hospital.[6]\n\nAs of May 13, 2010, the film completed editing.[8] Canadian indie rock band Broken Social Scene worked on the score for the film.[9]\n\n## Release\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for a limited release in the United States on September 24, 2010.[10] Focus Features later opted for a wide release of approximately 500 theaters across the US and a release date of October 8, 2010.[11] The film premiered at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.[12]\n\nTo coincide with the film's release, Hyperion Books published a new edition of the novel, featuring photos from the film on the cover.[13]\n\nThe film aired on HBO cable in the summer of 2011.[14]\n\n## Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 58% approval rating based on 138 reviews with an average rating of 6/10. The critics consensus states \"It's amiable, and it does a surprisingly good job of sidestepping psych ward comedy clichés, but given its talented cast and directors, It's Kind of a Funny Story should be more than just mildly entertaining.\"[15] On Metacritic, the film has an weighted average score of 63, based on 33 reviews, which indicates \"Generally favorable reviews\".[16]\n\nJustin Chang of Variety wrote: \"The filmmakers fully retain their offbeat sensibility and attentiveness to character while providing perhaps the sharpest showcase yet for Zach Galifianakis' outsized talents.\"[17]\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \"I don't blame you for backing off a movie that focuses on a suicidal teen who learns warm life lessons by spending five days in a Brooklyn hospital's psych ward. Stop worrying. It's Kind of a Funny Story, based on Ned Vizzini's semiautobiographical novel, breaks the jinx.\"[18]\n\nMichael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"A dramatically inert, lethargic dramedy that isn't nearly as quirky and poignant as it perceives itself.\"[19] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a negative review, saying \"There's very little that's even kind of funny in It's Kind of a Funny Story, which can't accurately be described as a comedy but isn't a true drama, either.\"[20]\n\n## Home media\n\nIt's Kind of a Funny Story was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 8, 2011.[15]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b Zeitchik, Steven (August 10, 2009). \"Focus is on 'Funny'\".

He was also facing feelings of inferiority in the shadow of his best friend Aaron, and pressure from his father to succeed academically. Throughout his stay, Craig bonds with various patients in the psychiatric unit, including Bobby, who takes Craig under his wing. Craig learns about Bobby's struggles and helps him, while Bobby helps Craig gain the courage to ask out Noelle, another patient. The film explores themes of friendship, love, and self-discovery as Craig navigates his mental health challenges.",

Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in Los Angeles and suggests that he come to stay with her in their childhood hometown of Nyack, New York. He agrees and meets Maggie's husband Lance.\n\nMilo is surprised when Lance tells him that he and Maggie are trying to have a baby, as Maggie never expressed a desire for children. Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking contraceptive pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she had been having sex with her scuba instructor Billy. She worries that she is not worthy of Lance, but Milo reassures her.\n\nMilo reconnects with his high school English teacher Rich, with whom he had a sexual relationship when he was 15. Rich now has a sixteen-year-old son and is dating a woman. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later, Milo appears at Rich's house while his son is there. This infuriates Rich, who does not want his past exposed. Maggie is also upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich, as she exposed the relationship to end it as well as Rich's teaching career.\n\nMilo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, a boy who their father had assured him would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turns out that the bully has a successful happy life, and it is Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he will not kill himself, and he promises to try not to.\n\nLance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, leading Lance to find the contraceptives.\n\nMaggie ends the relationship with Billy and returns home where she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no \"marriage\", and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide he should do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note and goes to the pool where she had been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to her body, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps into the pool and rescues her.\n\nThe film closes with the twins at Maggie's house, looking at their new fish tank filled with goldfish.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Bill Hader as Milo Dean, Maggie's brother\n- Kristen Wiig as Maggie Dean, Milo's sister\n- Luke Wilson as Lance, Maggie's husband\n- Ty Burrell as Rich Levitt, Milo's former teacher\n- Boyd Holbrook as Billy, Maggie's scuba instructor\n- Joanna Gleason as Judy Dean, Maggie and Milo's mother\n- Adriane Lenox as Dr. Linda Essex\n- Kathleen Rose Perkins as Carlie\n- Paul Castro Jr as Eric\n\n## Production\n\nThe script went through several iterations, including one in which Milo is a drag queen and the film more closely resembles a road trip movie,[10] but eventually Johnson and his writing partner settled on a more low-key approach inspired by the work of Hal Ashby and Alexander Payne.[10] Said Johnson, \"Something I wanted to be a part of this movie was brothers and sisters connecting with their secret language. No one can make you laugh harder, [but] no one can [tick] you off more.\"[11] Writing the film, Johnson wanted to avoid writing along genre lines, as he believes that comedy and drama are both present in everyday life.[12] He has described the theme of the movie as \"dealing with dark shit with a sense of humor.\"[12]\n\nOne notable scene features the two main characters lip syncing to \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\" by Starship.[13] Initially, the song the writers planned to use was \"Hold On\" by Wilson Phillips, but as the song had already played a focal point in Bridesmaids, it was decided to choose another song.[13] Accordingly, Johnson \"spent 24 hours listening to every cheesy mid-’80s ballad you can think of and looking in the mirror and lip syncing it myself.\"[13] The fact that \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\" is a duet opened up new possibilities: Johnson said, \"the scene became a little more epic because it became about Bill’s character getting Maggie (Wiig) to sing Grace Slick’s part\".[13]\n\nPrincipal photography, which began in November 2012 in Brooklyn, New York,[14]  took place over 22 days.[15] Although a full script was written, Johnson encouraged improvisation on the set.[12] Johnson has stated that an entirely improvised conversation between Wiig and Wilson involving Vibram shoes was his single favorite scene in the entire film.[12]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Skeleton Twins opened in a limited release in the United States in 15 theaters and grossed $380,691; the  average take per theater was $25,379, and it ranked #25 at the box office. The widest release for the film was 461 theaters, and it ultimately earned $5,279,678 domestically and $468,848 internationally for a total of $5,748,526, above its estimated budget of $1 million.[5][16]\n\n## Reception\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 87% based on 161 reviews, with an  average rating of 7/10. The website's critics consensus states: \"Led by powerful performances from Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, The Skeleton Twins effectively mines laughs and tears from family drama.\"[17] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 33 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[18]\n\n## Accolades\n\n| List of accolades received by The Skeleton Twins    |

Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in Los Angeles and suggests that he come to stay with her in their childhood hometown of Nyack, New York. He agrees and meets Maggie's husband Lance. Milo is surprised when Lance tells him that he and Maggie are trying to have a baby, as Maggie never expressed a desire for children. Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking contraceptive pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she had been having sex with her scuba instructor Billy. She worries that she is not worthy of Lance, but Milo reassures her. Milo reconnects with his high school English teacher Rich, with whom he had a sexual relationship when he was 15. Rich now has a sixteen-year-old son and is dating a woman. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later, Milo appears at Rich's house while his son is there. This infuriates Rich, who does not want his past exposed. Maggie is also upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich, as she exposed the relationship to end it as well as Rich's teaching career. Milo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, a boy who their father had assured him would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turns out that the bully has a successful happy life, and it is Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he will not kill himself, and he promises to try not to. Lance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, leading Lance to find the contraceptives. Maggie ends the relationship with Billy and returns home where she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no 'marriage', and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide he should do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note and goes to the pool where she had been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to her body, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps into the pool and rescues her. The film closes with the twins at Maggie's house, looking at their new fish tank filled with goldfish.\",\n            \"Cast\": [\n                {\"Bill Hader\": \"Milo Dean, Maggie's brother\"},\n                {\"Kristen Wiig\": \"Maggie Dean, Milo's sister\"},\n                {\"Luke Wilson\": \"Lance, Maggie's husband\"},\n                {\"Ty Burrell\": \"Rich Levitt, Milo's former teacher\"},\n                {\"Boyd Holbrook\": \"Billy, Maggie's scuba instructor\"},\n                {\"Joanna Gleason\": \"Judy Dean, Maggie and Milo's mother\"},\n                {\"Adriane Lenox\": \"Dr. Linda Essex\"},\n                {\"Kathleen Rose Perkins\": \"Carlie\"},\n                {\"Paul Castro Jr\": \"Eric\"}\n            ],\n            \"Production\": \"The script went through several iterations, including one in which Milo is a drag queen and the film more closely resembles a road trip movie, but eventually Johnson and his writing partner settled on a more low-key approach inspired by the work of Hal Ashby and Alexander Payne.

After his father's premature death, Gilbert has assumed the responsibility of caring for Arnie, his developmentally delayed younger brother. In addition to being Arnie's caregiver, Gilbert is expected to hold a steady job in order to provide for the family financially. Amy, Gilbert's older sister, assumes the maternal role. She cooks and cleans the family's home, and she even assists in its many repairs. However, it becomes clear that each family member is burdened by their responsibilities. They are still young, and it is evident that their emotional development has been stunted because they have been expected to behave like adults. Once Becky comes to town, the Grape family is pushed to re-evaluate their functionality, their domestic duties, and their own mental health statuses in order to preserve their longevity.\n\n## The Search for Freedom\n\nThe opening scene of the campers driving through Endora reveals that Gilbert Grape desires freedom but is ultimately deprived of it. In this way, Endora's vast landscape is, ironically, Gilbert's trap. When Gilbert meets Becky, he begins to understand that she personifies freedom. She possesses a worldliness and an excitement for life that he has always craved but never been able to act upon. Gilbert understands that fostering a relationship with Becky can allow him to share in her sense of freedom. In their numerous discussions over the course of the week, Gilbert begins to see his life in Endora differently and find freedom in his own isolated community. Gilbert's decision in the film's closing scene indicates the actualization of his \"freeing\" ideas.\n\n## The Healing Power of Love\n\nThis film, undoubtedly influenced by the cinéma vérité style, provides a realistic depiction of love. We see how each member of the Grape family loves one another. Even Bonnie, despite her inability to support her family, is repeatedly shown hugging, kissing, and praising her children. Out of love, Gilbert has put his life on hold in order to care for Arnie and maintain a steady job in order to pay his family's bills. Likewise, Amy has opted out of her own culinary aspirations in order to cook and clean for her siblings. When Gilbert falls in love with Becky, we see how his heart opens. His decision to introduce Becky to Bonnie indicates the love and trust he has in their relationship. In loving someone else, Gilbert is able to learn how to love himself. This realization drives him to burn his home and start a new stage of his life without burdens.\n\n## Breaking from Tradition\n\nThe Grape family deviates from the traditional American family. Instead of Bonnie providing for her entire family, the children are forced to provide for their mother. Additionally, their home lacks a father figure, and it is Gilbert's responsibility to assume this role. All of these factors make the Grape family a spectacle in their traditional, Midwestern town of Endora. For this reason, the entire town watches the family's every move and passes judgments when Arnie climbs the water tower. The town's model for a traditional, nuclear family is the Carvers. However, as the film progresses, we see how this family also breaks from traditional behavior and expectations.\n\n## Courage\n\nAlthough there are many ways in which courage is represented in the film, the two scenes in which Bonnie moves from the couch demonstrate her courageous spirit. When Bonnie leaves to go to the station in order to rescue Arnie, she willingly risks being tormented and laughed at by Endora residents. After marching into town, Bonnie's depression becomes even more severe. Her second act of courage occurs when she challenges herself to climb her stairs for the first time in seven years. Perhaps she did this so that she would be able to die in a removed part of the house, thus preventing the town from seeing her in her death.\n\n## Life is Fleeting\n\nAs Gilbert, Tucker, and Bobby sit in the town's diner, they ponder the meaning of life and its fleeting nature. After this discussion, the film is rocked by two sudden deaths. The first is the death of Mr. Carver, and the second is the death of Bonnie Grape. Though it does not take place throughout the course of the film, we learn that Mr. Grape also committed suicide seven years earlier. These deaths make a particular impression on Gilbert, who is seeing his own life pass before his eyes. We learn that although Gilbert has standards and responsibilities to uphold, he should stop inhibiting himself in order to live a life that he can be proud of.\n\n## The Importance of Acceptance\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Gilbert is intolerant of his family's differences. He is aggravated at Ellen's narcissism, bothered by his mother's obesity, and annoyed with Arnie's developmental delay. Gilbert's intolerance leads him to intense moments of anger. However, once Gilbert meets Becky, he is pushed to accept each of his family members for who they are. This absolves Gilbert of control and responsibility, and he is able to focus on himself and his own happiness. It is important that Gilbert first demonstrates his acceptance of Bonnie the night before her death. Perhaps Gilbert's validation grants her the peace to finally pass away.\n\n##### How To Cite https://www.gradesaver.com/whats-eating-gilbert-grape/study-guide/themes in MLA Format\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Study Guide Navigation\n- About What's Eating Gilbert Grape\n- What's Eating Gilbert Grape Summary\n- Character List\n- Cast List\n- Director's Influence\n- Glossary\n- Themes\n- Quotes and Analysis\n- Summary And Analysis\n    - \"Campers Arrive in Endora\"\n    - \"Getting to Know Becky\"\n    - \"The Death of Mr. Carver\"\n    - \"Leading Up to Arnie's Birthday\"\n    - \"Bonnie and the Party\"\n- Symbols, Allegory and Motifs\n- Irony\n- Imagery\n- Gender and the Home in What's Eating Gilbert Grape\n- Literary Elements\n- Essay Questions\n- Quizzes - Test Yourself!\n    - Quiz One\n    - Quiz Two\n    - Quiz Three\n    - Quiz Four\n- Citations\n- Related Content\n- Study Guide\n- Essays\n- Q &amp;amp; A\n- Lasse Hallstrom Biography\n\n#### What’s Eating Gilbert Grape Questions and Answers\n\nThe Question and Answer section for What’s Eating Gilbert Grape is a great\nresource to ask questions, find answers, and discuss the novel.\n\nWhy did Gilbert take the furniture out of the house?\n\nArnie tries to wake her but discovers that she has died.

Alongside his partner and protégé Frank Mercer, Roy runs short cons, selling overpriced water filtration systems to unsuspecting customers. One day, Roy accidentally spills his medication down the sink; he then discovers his doctor has skipped town and begins a cleaning spree in his house that lasts until the following day. Roy subsequently experiences a violent panic attack when Frank visits him. Frank suggests he see a psychiatrist, Dr. Harris Klein.\n\nKlein provides Roy with medication, and in therapy, Roy recalls his past relationship with Heather, his ex-wife who was pregnant during their divorce. At Roy's behest, Klein informs Roy he called Heather, finding out Roy has a 14-year-old daughter, Angela. Roy and Angela meet, and her youthful energy rejuvenates him. Jubilant, he agrees to work with Frank on a long con; their target is Chuck Frechette, an arrogant businessman whom they plan to con using the pigeon drop.\n\nOne night, Angela shows up at Roy's house, saying she has had a fight with her mother, deciding to stay for the weekend before returning to school. Exploring his belongings, she causes him to rethink his life, which he mentions during therapy with Klein. Angela returns home late one night, leading to an argument between them. During dinner, Roy admits he is a con artist and reluctantly agrees to teach Angela a con. They go to a local laundromat and con an older woman into believing she has won the lottery, so she shares half of her expected winnings with Angela; however, Roy then forces Angela to return the money.\n\nRoy goes bowling with Angela but is interrupted when Frank reveals that Chuck's flight to the Caymans has been updated to that day instead of Friday as planned. With little time, Roy reluctantly lets Angela distract Chuck midway through the con; however, after the con is finished, Chuck realizes what has happened and chases them into a parking garage before they escape. Roy then discovers Angela was arrested a year earlier and asks her to stop calling him.\n\nWithout Angela, Roy's myriad phobias resurface, and during another panic attack, he ultimately learns that the medication given to him by Klein is a placebo. To Frank's disappointment, he proclaims he needs Angela but would have to change his lifestyle. Roy reaches out to Angela, and they reconcile. After returning from dinner one night, they find Chuck waiting for them with a gun alongside a badly beaten Frank. Angela shoots Chuck, and Roy sends her off with Frank into hiding until the matter can be resolved. As Roy prepares to take care of Chuck's body, Chuck suddenly springs to life and knocks Roy unconscious.\n\nRoy awakens in a hospital, where the police inform him that Chuck died from the gunshot and Frank and Angela have disappeared. Klein appears, and Roy gives him the password to his large safety deposit box, ordering him to provide the money to Angela when she is found. Later, Roy awakens to find the \"police\" have disappeared, his \"hospital room\" is a freight container on the roof of a parking garage, \"Dr. Klein's\" office is vacant, and Roy's substantial cash savings have been taken. Frank reveals in a letter that he pulled a long con. Roy drives over to Heather's (whom he hasn't seen in years), looking for Angela. Roy learns the truth: Heather miscarried their child. The young woman he thought was their child was Frank's accomplice.\n\nOne year later, Roy is a salesman at a local carpet store, where one day Angela and her boyfriend wander in. Roy confronts Angela—who looks older than when she was conning him—but ultimately forgives her, realizing that he is happier as an honest man. Angela reveals that she did not receive her fair share of the cut from Frank and that it was the only con she ever pulled. She then asks Roy if he would like to know her real name, to which he replies \"I know your name.\" In turn, Angela says \"I'll see you, Dad.\" before departing with her boyfriend. Roy returns home to his new wife, Kathy, who is pregnant with his child.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller\n- Sam Rockwell as Frank Mercer\n- Alison Lohman as Angela\n- Bruce Altman as Dr. Harris Klein\n- Bruce McGill as Chuck Frechette\n- Sheila Kelley as Kathy\n- Beth Grant as Laundry Lady\n- Melora Walters as Heather, Roy's Former Wife (uncredited)\n- Jenny O'Hara as Mrs. Schaffer\n- Steve Eastin as Mr. Schaffer\n- Fran Kranz as Slacker Boyfriend\n- Tim Kelleher as Bishop\n- Tim Maculan as Pharmacist #2\n- Giannina Facio as Bank Teller\n- Sonya Eddy as Parking Garage Cashier\n- Jim Zulevic as Bartender\n\n## Release\n\n### Box office\n\nOpening in 2,711 theaters in the United States and Canada, the film's opening weekend gross stood at second place with $13.0 million for a per-theater-average of $4,827; it ultimately lost the number-one position to Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

The website's consensus reads: \"Breezy and well-acted, Matchstick Men focuses more on the characters than on the con.\"[6] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[7]\n\nRoger Ebert rated the film four stars (out of four) and described it as \"so absorbing that whenever it cuts away from the plot, there is another, better plot to cut to.\" He also recommended the film for several Oscar nominations, most notably Nicolas Cage's performance and the film's screenplay.[8] James Berardinelli awarded the film three-and-a-half stars (out of four), praising the film for its \"sly, biting sense of humor\" and \"emotionally satisfying\" elements. He also praised the film's acting, and ultimately noted that the film was \"worth every cent\" of the ticket price and was \"the first winner of the fall movie season.\"[9]\n\nSome critics were not impressed. Renee Graham of The Boston Globe criticized the film for its sentimentality, writing that \"director Ridley Scott goes all gooey in this off-key adaptation of Eric Garcia's cynical novel.\" Despite praising the performances of Sam Rockwell and Alison Lohman, Graham was not fond of Cage, writing that he is more \"irritating than interesting\" and that the film follows a similar style.[10]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Matchstick Men\".

Alongside his partner and protégé Frank Mercer, Roy runs short cons, selling overpriced water filtration systems to unsuspecting customers. One day, Roy accidentally spills his medication down the sink; he then discovers his doctor has skipped town and begins a cleaning spree in his house that lasts until the following day. Roy subsequently experiences a violent panic attack when Frank visits him. Frank suggests he see a psychiatrist, Dr. Harris Klein.\n\n        Klein provides Roy with medication, and in therapy, Roy recalls his past relationship with Heather, his ex-wife who was pregnant during their divorce. At Roy's behest, Klein informs Roy he called Heather, finding out Roy has a 14-year-old daughter, Angela. Roy and Angela meet, and her youthful energy rejuvenates him. Jubilant, he agrees to work with Frank on a long con; their target is Chuck Frechette, an arrogant businessman whom they plan to con using the pigeon drop.\n\n        One night, Angela shows up at Roy's house, saying she has had a fight with her mother, deciding to stay for the weekend before returning to school. Exploring his belongings, she causes him to rethink his life, which he mentions during therapy with Klein. Angela returns home late one night, leading to an argument between them. During dinner, Roy admits he is a con artist and reluctantly agrees to teach Angela a con. They go to a local laundromat and con an older woman into believing she has won the lottery, so she shares half of her expected winnings with Angela; however, Roy then forces Angela to return the money.\n\n        Roy goes bowling with Angela but is interrupted when Frank reveals that Chuck's flight to the Caymans has been updated to that day instead of Friday as planned. With little time, Roy reluctantly lets Angela distract Chuck midway through the con; however, after the con is finished, Chuck realizes what has happened and chases them into a parking garage before they escape. Roy then discovers Angela was arrested a year earlier and asks her to stop calling him.\n\n        Without Angela, Roy's myriad phobias resurface, and during another panic attack, he ultimately learns that the medication given to him by Klein is a placebo. To Frank's disappointment, he proclaims he needs Angela but would have to change his lifestyle. Roy reaches out to Angela, and they reconcile. After returning from dinner one night, they find Chuck waiting for them with a gun alongside a badly beaten Frank. Angela shoots Chuck, and Roy sends her off with Frank into hiding until the matter can be resolved. As Roy prepares to take care of Chuck's body, Chuck suddenly springs to life and knocks Roy unconscious.\n\n        Roy awakens in a hospital, where the police inform him that Chuck died from the gunshot and Frank and Angela have disappeared. Klein appears, and Roy gives him the password to his large safety deposit box, ordering him to provide the money to Angela when she is found. Later, Roy awakens to find the \"police\" have disappeared, his \"hospital room\" is a freight container on the roof of a parking garage, \"Dr. Klein's\" office is vacant, and Roy's substantial cash savings have been taken. Frank reveals in a letter that he pulled a long con. Roy drives over to Heather's (whom he hasn't seen in years), looking for Angela. Roy learns the truth: Heather miscarried their child. The young woman he thought was their child was Frank's accomplice.\n\n        One year later, Roy is a salesman at a local carpet store, where one day Angela and her boyfriend wander in. Roy confronts Angela—who looks older than when she was conning him—but ultimately forgives her, realizing that he is happier as an honest man. Angela reveals that she did not receive her fair share of the cut from Frank and that it was the only con she ever pulled. She then asks Roy if he would like to know her real name, to which he replies \"I know your name.\" In turn, Angela says \"I'll see you, Dad.\" before departing with her boyfriend. Roy returns home to his new wife, Kathy, who is pregnant with his child.\n    </Plot>\n    \n    <Cast>\n        <Actor>Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller</Actor>\n        <Actor>Sam Rockwell as Frank Mercer</Actor>\n        <Actor>Alison Lohman as Angela</Actor>\n        <Actor>Bruce Altman as Dr. Harris Klein</Actor>\n        <Actor>Bruce McGill as Chuck Frechette</Actor>\n        <Actor>Sheila Kelley as Kathy</Actor>\n        <Actor>Beth Grant as Laundry Lady</Actor>\n        <Actor>Melora Walters as Heather, Roy's Former Wife (uncredited)</Actor>\n        <Actor>Jenny O'Hara as Mrs. Schaffer</Actor>\n        <Actor>Steve Eastin as Mr. Schaffer</Actor>\n        <Actor>Fran Kranz as Slacker Boyfriend</Actor>\n        <Actor>Tim Kelleher as Bishop</Actor>\n        <Actor>Tim Maculan as Pharmacist #2</Actor>\n        <Actor>Giannina Facio as Bank Teller</Actor>\n        <Actor>Sonya Eddy as Parking Garage Cashier</Actor>\n        <Actor>Jim Zulevic as Bartender</Actor>\n    </Cast>\n</MovieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the information about \"Matchstick Men\" according to the specified attributes, ensuring that the content remains coherent and informative while highlighting key details with XML tags.",

Logan Lerman stars as a teenager named Charlie who writes to an unnamed friend, and these epistles chronicle his trials, tribulations, and triumphs as he goes through his freshman year of high school. The film depicts his struggles with his, unbeknownst to him, post-traumatic stress disorder, as he goes through his journey in high school making new friends, portrayed by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. The film's ensemble cast also includes Mae Whitman, Kate Walsh, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusack, Nina Dobrev, and Paul Rudd in supporting roles.\n\nChbosky had always intended to adapt the novel to film, but did not rush to do so. He was hesitant to sell the rights to the film to anyone, but eventually sold them to Mr. Mudd Productions as long as they let him write and direct the film. Filming began in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in May 2011 and lasted approximately fifty days.[2][5][6][7]\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower had its world premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012, to a standing ovation. It was released theatrically in the United States on September 21, 2012, by Summit Entertainment. The film was well received by critics, who praised Chbosky's screenplay and direction, the performances of Lerman, Watson and Miller, soundtrack, execution of its topics, and emotional weight. It was also a box office success, grossing $33.3 million on a budget of $13 million, and received several accolades, including the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature, two Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations, and the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Wide Release. The film has since become a cult classic,[8] especially among Zillennials, and helped define the \"Tumblr era\" in the early 2010s.[9]\n\n## Plot\n\nIn 1991, Charlie, who has suffered from clinical depression since childhood, has been discharged from a mental health care institution. Uneasy about beginning his freshman year of high school, he is shy and only manages to make friends with his English teacher.\n\nCharlie meets two seniors, Patrick and his stepsister Sam. After the homecoming dance, Sam and Patrick invite him to a party with their friend group. He unknowingly eats a cannabis brownie, gets high, and makes speeches to the amusement of the party-goers. He also walks in on Patrick and Brad, the high school quarterback, kissing. Patrick tells Charlie that Brad is closeted, so he agrees to keep it a secret. Charlie discloses to Sam that his best friend committed suicide the year before, making her realize that Charlie has no other friends, so she and Patrick bring Charlie into their group. On their way home, the three hear an unknown song on the radio. Sam instructs Patrick to drive through a tunnel so she can stand up in the back of the pickup while the music blasts.\n\nSam needs to improve her SAT scores to have a better chance of being accepted into Penn State University, so Charlie offers to tutor her. This improves her scores, and at Christmas, she gives him a vintage typewriter. They discuss relationships, and Charlie reveals he has never been kissed. Sam reveals that her first kiss was at age 11 by her father's boss. Charlie reveals that his Aunt Helen was also sexually assaulted as a child. Sam tells Charlie she wants his first kiss to be from someone who loves him, and they kiss.\n\nAt a party, Charlie trips on LSD. He cannot control his flashbacks of Aunt Helen, who died in a car crash on her way to buy him his 7th birthday gift. He ends up in the hospital after falling asleep in the snow. At a regular The Rocky Horror Picture Show performance, Sam asks Charlie to fill in for her boyfriend, Craig. Their friend Mary Elizabeth is impressed and asks him to the Sadie Hawkins dance, and they enter an unsatisfactory relationship. At a party, when Charlie is dared to kiss the prettiest girl in the room, he chooses Sam, upsetting both her and Mary Elizabeth. Patrick tells Charlie to stay away from the group for a while and Charlie sinks into depression.\n\nBrad shows up to school with bruises on his face after his father catches him and Patrick together. Brad says he was jumped and beaten up. When his friends start bullying Patrick  at a lunch break, he does not help him stand up for himself and calls him a \"faggot\". In anger, Patrick punches him, causing him to retaliate. Brad's friends beat Patrick and prevent Sam from intervening when Charlie does before blacking out. Upon recovering, he finds that he has incapacitated Brad's friends. Sam and Patrick thank Charlie, and the three become friends again.\n\nCharlie's mental state worsens. Patrick tries to cope with what happened with Brad and kisses Charlie before immediately apologizing. Sam is accepted into Penn State, and she breaks up with Craig on prom night after learning he is cheating on her. The night before she departs, she brings Charlie to her room. They confide in each other and kiss, but when Sam touches Charlie's thigh, he experiences a flashback of his Aunt Helen, which he passes off.\n\nAfter Sam leaves for college, Charlie's emotional state and flashbacks worsen. He calls his sister, who realizes he is in distress and calls the police. Charlie eyes  a kitchen knife as they burst through the door and awakens in a hospital, where psychiatrist Dr. Burton brings out his repressed memories, revealing that his aunt sexually abused him as a child.\n\nThe night Charlie is released from the hospital, he is visited by Sam and Patrick. The three revisit the tunnel, having identified the song (Heroes by David Bowie), and Charlie and Sam share a kiss. Charlie stands up in the back of the truck. He acknowledges that he feels alive and that, at the moment, \"we are infinite\".\n\n## Cast\n\n- Logan Lerman as Charlie Kelmeckis\n- Emma Watson as Samantha \"Sam\" Button\n- Ezra Miller as Patrick Stewart\n- Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth\n- Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson, Charlie's English teacher\n- Nina Dobrev as Candace Kelmeckis, Charlie's sister\n- Johnny Simmons as Brad Hayes\n- Erin Wilhelmi as Alice\n- Adam Hagenbuch as Bob\n- Kate Walsh as Mrs. Kelmeckis\n- Dylan McDermott as Mr. Kelmeckis\n- Melanie Lynskey as Helen, Charlie's aunt\n- Joan Cusack as Dr. Burton\n- Zane Holtz as Chris Kelmeckis, Charlie's older brother\n- Reece Thompson as Craig, Sam's boyfriend\n- Nicholas Braun as Ponytail Derek, Candace's boyfriend\n- Landon Pigg as Peter\n- Tom Savini as Mr. Callahan\n- Julia Garner as Susan\n\n## Production\n\n### Development\n\nStephen Chbosky at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChbosky incorporated both fictional ideas and personal experiences into the novel.[10] After five years with these elements in mind,[10] he had the idea of writing the novel during a difficult period in his life.[11] He was experiencing an unpleasant breakup of his own,[11] which led him to ask, \"Why do good people let themselves get treated so badly?\"[12] The author tried to answer the question with the sentence \"we accept the love we think we deserve\". This quote references the struggle of finding self love, encompassing one's life and hope for the future, and not just romantic love.[13]\n\nThe story began when Chbosky was in school, evolving from another book on which he was working.[10] In that book he wrote the sentence, \"I guess that's just one of the perks of being a wallflower\", which led him to realize \"that somewhere in that ... was the kid I was really trying to find.\"[10] Chbosky began writing the novel in the summer of 1996 while he was in college,[14] and within ten weeks he completed the story.[10] He rewrote it into two more drafts, concluding the published version in the summer of 1998.[14]\n\nCharlie was loosely based on Chbosky himself. Like the novel itself, Chbosky included much of his own memories from the time he lived in Pittsburgh into the film.[15] The other characters were manifestations of people Chbosky had known throughout his life;[16] Chbosky focused on people's struggles and what they are passionate about, attempting to pin down the very nature of each of the characters.[17] The characters of Sam and Patrick were an \"amalgamate and celebration\" of several people Chbosky has met; Sam was based on girls who confided in him, and Patrick was \"all the kids I knew who were gay and finding their way to their own identity.\"[15]\n\nShortly after the novel's release, Chbosky began to write a screenplay for it.[18] Chbosky recalled a meeting with his agent saying, \"My agent said we would average a call a week, whether it was from producers optioning it or a writer or director wanting to adapt. Even a German film company, I don't know the name of the company, but they wanted to buy it and turn it into a German film, which I would love to have seen, in an alternate universe kind of way. Yeah, there were many offers, but I couldn't let it go. I don't know how to sell something this personal. And especially what the book meant to the fans—I couldn't let it go to anyone else. I owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book.\"[18] When he finally did sit down and started on penning the screenplay, he found it more difficult than the book. The novel took him just four months to write, while the script took him a year.[19]\n\nChbosky would not sell the rights to the film unless a studio also let him adapt and direct the film. John Malkovich's production company—Mr. Mudd Productions—purchased the rights to the film and let Chbosky himself write the script and direct the film.\n\nAfter discovering, from her agent, that no one in Hollywood wanted to fund the movie due to its subject matter, Emma Watson flew out to Los Angeles to pitch the film and met with multiple studio executives from all the major film studios such as Paramount, Warner Bros., Disney, etc. In January 2011 after Watson met with and pitched the film to Erik Feig, he gave the greenlight, which led to Summit acquiring the distribution rights.[20][21][22] The following month, Summit sought a buyer for the project at the European Film Market held simultaneously with the Berlin International Film Festival.[23]\n\n### Casting\n\nIn May 2010, Logan Lerman and Emma Watson were reportedly in talks for the project[24] and confirmed the following year.[25] In April 2011, Mae Whitman signed on as Mary Elizabeth and Nina Dobrev was cast as Candace. Paul Rudd was cast as Mr. Anderson later that month.[26] On May 9, 2011, Kate Walsh announced that she was cast in the film as Charlie's mother and had begun filming.[27] On May 19, 2011, it was announced that Ezra Miller had joined the film.[28]\n\n### Filming\n\nThe film was shot in the Cincinnati &amp; Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area from May 9 to June 29, 2011.[29] Initial filming began in Pittsburgh's South Hills, including South Park, Upper St. Clair, and Peters Township High School.[30][31]\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show scenes were filmed at The Hollywood Theater in Dormont[32] after Chbosky learned that the theater was re-opening; he had seen The Rocky Horror Picture Show there when he was younger.[33]\n\nThe film also has scenes within Pittsburgh city limits inside the Fort Pitt Tunnel, Fort Pitt Bridge on Interstate 376 and on Mount Washington.[34]\n\n## Music\n\nThe soundtrack to The Perks of Being a Wallflower was released by Atlantic Records on September 11, 2012, a month before the film's release.[35] The film's music was chosen by the film's director Stephen Chbosky and music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas, while the incidental music was scored by Michael Brook.[36] The score album was released September 25, 2012.[37]\n\nChbosky wrote on the album's liner notes, “I’ve shared them with friends. And they have shared their favorites with me. Some of the songs are popular. Some of them are not known by a whole lot of people. But they are all great in their own way. And since these songs have meant a lot to me, I just wanted you to have them as a soundtrack for whatever you need them to be for your life.”[38][39]\n\n## Release\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower had its world premiere[40] at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012, to a standing ovation.[41]\n\nThe film was initially scheduled for release on September 14, 2012, but in August 2012, it was announced that the release would be delayed by a week to September 21, 2012, in selected cities.[42] The film continued to expand on September 28, 2012, with a nationwide release on October 5, 2012. The UK premiere was on September 23[43] at the Cambridge Film Festival.\n\n### Rating\n\nThe film originally received an R rating from the MPAA for \"teen drug and alcohol use, and some sexual references\". The filmmakers appealed, and the MPAA changed it to PG-13 for \"mature thematic material, drug and alcohol use, sexual content including references, and a fight—all involving teens\".[44]\n\n### Box office\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower received a limited release of four theaters in the United States on September 21, 2012, and grossed $228,359 on its limited opening weekend, averaging $57,089 per theater. The film earned $17,742,948 in North America and $15,641,179 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $33,384,127.[2][45][46]\n\n## Reception\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a heartfelt and sincere adaptation that's bolstered by strong lead performances.\"[47] On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[48] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[49]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe performances of , , and  (left to right) received critical acclaim.\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing in his review, \"All of my previous selves still survive somewhere inside of me, and my previous adolescent would have loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower\".[50]\n\nThe lead cast also earned positive notice. Ian Buckwalter of The Atlantic said:\n\nThe primary trio of actors delivers outstanding performances, starting with Watson, who sheds the memory of a decade playing Hermione in the Harry Potter series with an about-face as a flirtatious but insecure free spirit. Miller also plays against their most recent performance, which was as the tightly wound eponymous teenage psychopath in We Need to Talk About Kevin, to deliver a giddy, scene-stealing turn as Patrick. Lerman, best known for the Percy Jackson series, shines as Charlie, a role that demands he be immediately likeable while still holding onto some deep darkness that can't be fully revealed until the end.[51]\n\nJohn Anderson of Newsday also praised the cast, saying:\n\nAs Sam, the quasi-bad girl trying to reinvent herself before college, she (Emma Watson) brings honesty and a lack of cliche to a character who might have been a standard-issue student. But equally fine are her co-stars: Ezra Miller, who plays the gay character Patrick as something messy and unusual; Paul Rudd, as their English teacher, is refreshingly thoughtful. And Charlie is portrayed by Lerman as quietly observant, yearning and delicate in a way that will click with audiences regardless of age.[52]\n\nSome critics had a less favorable response to the film, with the main criticism being that the portrayal of teenage issues is idealized and the casting uninspired. The Miami Herald critic Connie Ogle notes that \"the suicide of Charlie's best friend, which takes place before the film opens, seems glossed over too quickly\" despite the event being Charlie's main character motivation in the film.[53] Jack Wilson of The Age writes, \"the script is transparently fake at almost every moment, congratulating the gang on their non-conformity while soft-pedalling any aspect of adolescent behaviour—drug use, sex, profanity—that might upset the American mainstream.\"[54] Richard Corliss of Time criticized the casting of actors in their twenties to play teenage characters unlike Heathers (1989), another coming-of-age film in which the lead actors were actual teenagers.[55]\n\nMTV, Us Weekly and Complex named The Perks of Being a Wallflower one of the best films of 2012.[56][57][58]\n\nThe film also influenced the \"Tumblr culture\" that was around online when the film was released, with online users posting GIFs of the film's cast and aphorisms on the site during the early 2010s.[59]\n\n### Accolades\n\n| Award                                         | Date of ceremony    | Category                        | Recipient(s)

When she won a lottery that grants her a sizable amount of money, she produces, acts, and stars in a TV series entitled: Welcome to Me.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is the most endearing thing Kristen Wiig has done, outside her usual comedy movies. The way she portrays Alice is so heartbreaking and detailed, sometimes funny, but also feels authentic. The supporting cast did a good job too, especially Linda Cardellini.\n\nHowever, this movie is definitely not for everyone. As the title and the premise suggests, this movie is going to be all about Alice and her world. Alice's actions are questionable and maybe some audience can't digest that properly.\n\nIf you're interested in movies about psychology issues, then this is definitely a movie for you. Otherwise if you want to feel good, you might want to pick up something else, as the constant melancholy and confusion this movie brought will disillusion you, forcing you into saying \"What the hell was that?\" when the credits roll.\n\n- yuschaa\n- Aug 20, 2016\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ19\n\n- How long is Welcome to Me?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - May 1, 2015 (United States)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Canada\n- Official site\n    - Official Facebook\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Bana Hoş Geldiniz\n- Filming locations\n    - Whitewater, California, USA(road scenes)\n- Production companies\n    - BRON Studios\n    - Gary Sanchez Productions\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $608,852\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $34,920\n    - May 3, 2015\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $636,819\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 27 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.85 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nBy what name was Welcome to Me (2014) officially released in India in English?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

                "Plot": "Following the death of their mother Nawal, an Arab immigrant in Canada, Jeanne and her twin brother Simon meet with French Canadian notary Jean Lebel, their mother's employer and family friend. Nawal's will refers to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, who they believed was dead. Nawal has left two letters; one is to be delivered to Jeanne and Simon's father, and the other is to be delivered to their brother. Jeanne accepts; Simon, on the other hand, seemingly having had a more difficult relationship with Nawal and her unusual personality, is reluctant to join Jeanne on this pursuit. A series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Levantine country, and that she fell in love with a refugee named Wahab, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her in an honor killing, but her grandmother spares her, making her promise to leave the village after the birth of her baby and start a new life in the fictional city of Daresh. The grandmother tattoos the back of the baby's heel and sends him to an orphanage. While Nawal is at university in Daresh, civil war and war crimes break out, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by a Muslim militant, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Nawal leaves town to try to find her son and boards a bus full of Muslim refugees. Christian Nationalists shoot the driver and fire into the bus full of passengers, only missing Nawal and a mother with her child. As the Nationalists prepare to set the bus on fire, the survivors try to escape towards the back of the bus. Nawal shows her crucifix and tells the Nationalists that she is Christian. She attempts to save a child by claiming her as her own, but the child runs back towards the burning bus, calling for her mother, and is unceremoniously shot. Nawal finds her way back to town and joins the Muslim fighters. She tutors the son of a nationalist leader, eventually earning enough trust to smuggle in a gun to shoot the leader. She is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and sings through the screams of other prisoners, earning her the nickname 'The Woman Who Sings'. To attempt to break her, she is raped by torturer Abou Tarek who leaves her saying, 'Sing now.' She consequently gives birth to the twins. After traveling to her mother's native country, Jeanne gradually uncovers this past and persuades Simon to join her. With help from Lebel, they learn their brother's name is Nihad of May (the month he was born in) and track down Chamseddine. Simon meets with him, and he reveals the war-mad Nihad was captured by the nationalists, turned by them, trained as a torturer, and then sent to Kfar Ryat, where he took the name Abou Tarek, making him both the twins' half-brother and father; as such, both letters are addressed to the same person. Like Nawal, Nihad's superiors gave him a new life in Canada after the war. By chance, Nawal encountered him at a Canadian swimming pool and saw both the tattoo (proving him as her son) and his face (proving him as her rapist). The shock of learning the truth caused Nawal to suffer a stroke, which led to her decline and untimely death at age 60. The twins find Nihad in Canada and deliver Nawal's letters to him. He opens both of them; the first letter addresses him as the twins' father, the rapist, and is filled with contempt. The second letter addresses him as the twins' brother and is instead written with caring words, saying that he, as Nawal's son, is deserving of love. Horrified at the truth, Nihad tries to chase after the twins, but they are gone. Nawal gets her gravestone. Sometime later, Nihad visits it.",

                    "Development": "Director Denis Villeneuve adapted Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies after seeing it performed in Montreal in 2004. Parts of the story were based on the life of Souha Bechara. The story is based on events that happened during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990, but the filmmakers attempted to make the location of the plot ambiguous. Director Denis Villeneuve first saw Wajdi Mouawad's play Incendies at Théâtre de Quat'Sous in Montreal in 2004, commenting 'I had this strong intuition that I was in front of a masterpiece'. Villeneuve acknowledged unfamiliarity with Arab culture, but was drawn to Incendies as 'a modern story with a sort of Greek tragedy element'. In adapting the screenplay, Villeneuve, while keeping the story structure and characters, replaced 'all' the dialogue, even envisioning a silent film, abandoning the idea due to expense. He showed Mouawad some completed scenes to convince the initially reluctant playwright to grant permission for the film. Villeneuve spent five years working on the screenplay, in between directing two films. Mouawad later praised the film as 'brilliantly elegant' and gave Villeneuve full credit. The project had a budget of $6.5 million, and received funding from Telefilm Canada."

                "Reception": {
                    "BoxOffice": "In Canada, the film passed the $1 million mark at the box office by October 2010. By the end of April 2011, the film grossed $4.7 million. In Quebec theatres alone, Incendies made $3 million. It was considered a success in the country. According to Box Office Mojo, the film completed its theatrical run on 29 September 2011, after making $2,071,334 in the U.S. According to The Numbers, the film grossed $6,857,096 in North America and $9,181,247 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,038,343.",
                    "CriticalResponse": "Incendies received highly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% positive reviews based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critics consensus reads, 'It's messy, overlong, and a touch melodramatic, but those flaws pale before Incendies' impressive acting and devastating emotional impact.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 80 out 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating 'generally favorable reviews'. The film enjoyed a positive reception in its country and province. Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal gave it 3.5 stars out of four and wrote, 'Villeneuve has done his best work yet here'. The Montreal Gazette's Brendan Kelly gave the film five stars and called it a 'masterwork'. Marc Cassivi of La Presse claimed the film transcended the play. Peter Howell, writing for The Toronto Star, gave the film four stars, called it 'a commanding film of multiple revelations', and the best of 2010, and praised Lubna Azabal as 'first amongst equals'. However, Martin Morrow of CBC News was unimpressed, saying, 'Villeneuve's screen adaptation strips away all this finely textured flesh and leaves only the bare bones'. University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote that the film, along with Monsieur Lazhar (2011) and War Witch (2012), represent a break in the Cinema of Quebec from focus on local history to global concerns, with Incendies adding Oedipal themes. Authors Gada Mahrouse, Chantal Maillé and Daniel Salée wrote McCraw and Déry's films, Incendies, Monsieur Lazhar and Inch'Allah, depict Quebec as part of the global village and as accepting minorities, particularly Middle Easterners or 'Muslim Others'. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars, saying 'it wants to be much more than a thriller and succeeds in demonstrating how senseless and futile it is to hate others because of their religion', and Azabal 'is never less than compelling'. He later selected the film as his favourite to win the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it lost to In a Better World from Denmark. Leonard Maltin also gave the film three and a half stars, referring to it as 'tough, spellbinding'. Ty Burr, writing for The Boston Globe, gave the film three and a half stars, praising a bus scene as harrowing but saying the climax is 'a plot twist that feels like one coincidence too far', that 'leaves the audience doing math on their fingers rather than reeling in shock'. Incendies was named by Stephen Holden of The New York Times as one of the 10 best films of 2011. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it Villeneuve's 'best-realized work yet'. A number of reviews complimented use of the song 'You and Whose Army?' by Radiohead. Criticisms have included charges of melodrama and orientalism."

                "Accolades": "On 22 September 2010, Incendies was chosen to represent Canada at the 83rd Academy Awards in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. It made the shortlist on 19 January 2011, one of nine films and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on 25 January 2011. It won eight awards at the 31st Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Actress for Azabal and Best Director for Villeneuve. Along with Incendies, Villeneuve won the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award in 2009 for the film Polytechnique, the first Canadian filmmaker to win it twice in a row. Incendies also won the Prix Jutra for Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actress (Azabal), Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes and Sound. It is also the only film to date to have won both the Toronto International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film and the Vancouver International Film Festival Award for Best Canadian Film."

                "Plot": "Aging Reno, Nevada, police detective Jerry Black attends a retirement party hosted by his department during which Captain Pollack presents tickets to Jerry for a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The celebration is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak, to the scene of the crime. Jerry delivers the bad news to Ginny's parents, and the mother, Margaret Larsen, makes Jerry swear on a cross, made by their daughter, that he will find the killer. A suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah, a Native American man with an intellectual disability, is found the next day. Stan uses Toby's disorder to his advantage, convincing him that he killed Ginny. After having confessed to doing so, Toby steals a deputy's gun and commits suicide. An autopsy on Ginny proves that she had consumed chocolate before she died; wrappers found in Toby's truck solidify the likelihood that he killed the little girl, and the case is closed, despite Jerry's suspicions. Still adamant about his pledge to find the killer, Jerry chooses not to go to Mexico and misses his flight. Instead, he visits Ginny's grandmother, Annalise Hansen, who tells him of the many stories that she and Ginny used to read; one tells of an angel who descends from Heaven in order to fly a deceased child over all the places it loved in life, before delivering it to God. Jerry then visits one of Ginny's friends, Becky Fiske, who reveals that she had made friends with a man she called 'The Giant' shortly before she was killed. Jerry finds a picture Ginny drew of 'The Giant', but it does not resemble Toby, and features a black station wagon and not the red truck driven by Toby. He takes the drawing with him. Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three local, unsolved cases that bear the same modus operandi as seen with Ginny's, which Toby could not have possibly committed because he was incarcerated at the time. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack and Stan, who are doubtful. While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station near the center of the cases. After buying the station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori, and her daughter, Chrissy. He takes an interest in Chrissy and becomes friends with the small family. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains that her ex (against whom Lori has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry, out of concern for their safety, suggests that Lori and Chrissy move in with him temporarily; she agrees. Jerry slowly develops a fatherly relationship with Chrissy and even begins a romance with Lori herself. One day, local pastor Gary Jackson visits Chrissy outside the station. Jerry suspects that Jackson is Ginny's killer after he invites Chrissy to his church. Jerry rushes to the church after Jackson picks her up one day while he is fishing, but finds it was nothing more than a close call, and that Jackson is not the killer. Meanwhile, Chrissy meets a man who drives a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror; porcupines were another aspect of Ginny's drawing that stood out to Jerry. That night, while reading her a bedtime story, Chrissy tells Jerry that she met a 'wizard' who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell anyone about their interaction. (A later scene hints that the chocolates are laced with narcotics.) Chrissy tells Jerry she is supposed to meet the 'wizard' again the next day at a nearby picnic area. Using Chrissy as bait, Jerry stages a sting operation with Stan's help to catch the killer. However, while on the way to the meeting, the 'wizard' dies in a car accident; hours later, the SWAT team gives up and leaves Jerry alone. They inform Lori of what is happening. She confronts Jerry angrily about putting Chrissy in danger and breaks up with him. Sometime later, Jerry sits by himself on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute, and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there, unaware that he is actually dead.",

She wakes up in the hospital with amnesia, recalling nothing about the incident or her life prior. A man by her bedside (Mike Vogel) introduces himself as Russell Williams, her husband, and says that her name is Jennifer. To help her regain memories, he shows her photos of her life, telling her that her parents died in a fire two years ago, that she had quit her job, and that she rarely talks to her friends anymore. Detective Frank Page (Dennis Haysbert), obsessed with his work after failing to find his own daughter's kidnapper, investigates Jennifer's accident and grows suspicious of Russell, who drives a truck similar to one seen in the vicinity where Jennifer was hit. After Jennifer is discharged, Russell takes her to their secluded home. Jennifer is haunted by brief flashes of memories from the rainy night of her accident. She becomes uneasy by Russell's strange behavior and realizes that he has been locking her inside the house at night. She also notices that most of the photos in her home have been manipulated. Frank's investigation leads him to Jennifer's parents' home, where he finds their rotting corpses. He learns from Jennifer's former employer that 'Russell' is actually Ryan Gaerity, a temperamental worker fired over two months ago. While Ryan is out, Jennifer finds her own ID in his wallet, which she uses to unlock his computer. She finds images of her actual husband Russell (Daniel Booko) and realizes the danger she's in. Before she can escape, Ryan knocks her unconscious and chains her to the bed while he goes out to get supplies. When he returns, the real Russell's corpse is revealed to be in his car trunk. Frank arrives at their home and tries to rescue Jennifer, but Ryan knocks him out, locking him in a freezer. He rants to Jennifer that he had loved her for years but her lack of reciprocation and marriage to Russell enraged him, leading him to kill Russell and take Jennifer for himself. Jennifer manages to escape into the forest with Ryan giving chase. Knowing that Jennifer will never love him, Ryan decides to kill her with his gun, but Frank tackles him before he can shoot her, and Jennifer takes the gun and shoots Ryan in the arm. A wounded Ryan desperately attempts to run towards Jennifer to retrieve the gun, but Jennifer fires another shot, ultimately killing Ryan. Three months later, Frank gives Jennifer a note from her late husband that he had found during the investigation. As she drives, leaving for San Jose, Russell's voice narrates the note, telling her how much he loves her.",

                "Plot": "Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, Money Monster. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview, but Camby unexpectedly departed for a business trip to Geneva, Switzerland. Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The man reveals that his name is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on camera. He was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, Kyle will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives. With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and locate Camby, though Kyle is dissatisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He is angered by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied with her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues by contacting a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position without someone meddling with it. Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, siding with Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong. Once Camby arrives, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that instead of going to Geneva he went to Johannesburg, South Africa. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper misses a shot at Lee, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where, according to Diane, Camby is headed. They head out with network cameramen, Lenny, plus the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Having earned his trust, Kyle admits to Lee that the vest did not actually contain explosives, simply clay. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers. Camby had bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owner's stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. Had his plan succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when mine work resumed and the owner's stock owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe union leader Moshe Mambo to stop the strike, but he refused, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the failing company. Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. He finally admits to his wrongdoing on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away. Then Kyle, much to Lee's dismay, gets fatally shot by the police. Lee punches Camby, as his greed and corruption cost Kyle his life. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be placed under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Lee and Patty reconcile, wondering how they follow their last broadcast.",

In July 2014, it was announced that production would begin after Clooney completed the Coen brothers' Hail, Caesar!, and principal photography on the film began in New York City on February 27, 2015. On April 8, filming began on Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, where it would last for 15 days. A scene was also shot in front of Federal Hall National Memorial. Some re-shooting for the film took place in mid-January 2016 in New York City on William Street and Broad Street."

                "Release": "In August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment set the film for an April 8, 2016 release. The film was later pushed back to May 13, 2016. The Money Monster Premiered in Cannes on May 12, 2016, where the cast attended the photocall and screening in the evening.",
                "Reception": {
                    "BoxOffice": "Money Monster grossed $41 million in the United States and Canada, and $52.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $93.3 million, against a net production budget of $27 million. In North America, the film was released alongside The Darkness and the wide expansion of Green Room, and was projected to gross $10–12 million from 3,104 theaters in its opening weekend. The film grossed $600,000 from its early Thursday night previews and $5 million on its first day. It went on to gross $14.8 million in its opening weekend, beating expectations and finishing 3rd at the box office behind Captain America: Civil War and The Jungle Book. It fell 53% to $7 million in its second weekend, finishing 6th.",
                    "CriticalResponse": "On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 59% based on 284 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site's critics consensus reads: 'Money Monster's strong cast and solidly written story ride a timely wave of socioeconomic anger that's powerful enough to overcome an occasionally muddled approach to its worthy themes.' On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating 'mixed or average reviews'. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of 'B+' on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 81% overall positive score, with 56% saying they would definitely recommend it. Clooney's performance was praised by critics. A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that the 'quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points.' Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com, in a mixed review, praised Clooney's 'enormous charisma', but criticized the film for not 'being quite as thrilling or thought-provoking as [its] premise sounds.' Chris Hewitt of Empire however gave a more positive review. Several reviewers praised the atmosphere of suspense. Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the film, particularly Foster's directing and her ability to 'keep things moving'. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that Foster 'keeps the action vigorous and the suspense high', but said that the film was 'swallowed up by the very hectoring and impersonal sensationalism that it derides.' Some reviewers criticized the script. Wendy Ide of The Observer gave the film a negative review, writing that the film lacks the 'authentic anger' of The Big Short and the 'sniper-like accuracy' of Network, criticizing Clooney's 'complete lack of sincerity'. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that what the script lacks in 'emotional subtext' can be found in the cast's 'richly detailed' performances. In a mixed review, Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called the film a 'raucous hostage thriller that eschews explanation for wish-fulfillment', concluding by saying that 'in the heat of the moment, Money Monster's bluster and nerve keeps you hooked.' Josh Lasser of IGN was critical of the film's mix of comedy and drama, calling the transitions 'too fast, ripping the audience out of the unfolding drama.' Despite comparisons of Clooney's character to Jim Cramer and his TV show Mad Money, Clooney and Foster denied this."

                "Plot": "In Monte Carlo, Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier) stops to speak to Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) only after recognizing her companion (Joan Fontaine), the woman he had encountered earlier. Maxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge, seemingly contemplating suicide. A young woman shouts at him to stop him in his tracks, but he curtly asks her to walk on. Later, at a Monte Carlo hotel, the same young woman, serving as a paid companion to the pompous aging Mrs. Van Hopper, again encounters the debonair widower de Winter. Aspiring to social prominence, Mrs. Van Hopper is obsequious to the aristocratic de Winter, but is soon confined to her room due to illness. Maxim invites the companion on excursions, which she conceals from her employer as tennis lessons, and the young woman soon becomes infatuated, though puzzled by such attention. On her recovery, Mrs. Van Hopper decides to leave Monte Carlo; her companion furtively informs Maxim of her departure, and Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. After being informed of the proposal by Maxim, a shocked Mrs. Van Hopper privately tells her companion that Maxim is marrying her as a desperate distraction because he is still tormented by thoughts of his beloved dead wife, Rebecca. She asserts that her companion is ill-prepared to be the second Mrs. de Winter and cannot hope to succeed as the mistress of the stately Manderley. Maxim brings his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in Cornwall. Manderley is dominated by its austere housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a cold and unyielding woman who had once been a confidante of the first Mrs. de Winter. Danvers harbors a deep resentment for the new Mrs. de Winter, whom she views as a usurper. Danvers feeds the bride's insecurity by showing her Rebecca's grand bedroom suite, left untouched and off-limits to the new wife, and by retaining items throughout the house that carry Rebecca's monogram. Eventually, constant reminders of Rebecca's glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his tragically drowned first wife, which could explain his restlessness and irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to assert her new role by holding a costume party as Maxim and Rebecca had done annually. Danvers suggests she copy the dress that one of Maxim's ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. However, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. When Mrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window of Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog and, during the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat with Rebecca's body in it has been discovered. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When Rebecca implied she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim's line. During a heated argument, Rebecca fell, struck her head, and died. Afraid he would be blamed for her death, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled; some days later, he identified another body that washed ashore as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her naïve ways. When the inquest considers the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, threatening to reveal a letter from Rebecca hinting at a pregnancy that made suicide improbable. When Maxim informs the police of the attempted blackmail, they must investigate Favell's accusations that Maxim murdered Rebecca. Further investigation with a doctor, however, reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her to ruin him. As a free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.",

Vincent accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself. Months later, Malcolm has begun working with Cole Sear, a nine-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his own failure to help Vincent and to reconcile with Anna, who is suffering from depression. Cole's mother Lynn worries about him, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is terribly scared of a cupboard, they lock him in it, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him. Once released, he faints and appears to have been physically assaulted, which his mother attributes to the bullies. Following this, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees dead people who are unaware that they are dead. Malcolm believes Cole is schizophrenic and considers dropping his case. However, after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man begging for help in Spanish when Vincent was supposed to be alone in the room, suggesting that Vincent had the same ability. He realizes that Cole is telling the truth and suggests that he try to communicate with the ghosts and help them. One night, Cole finds Kyra Collins, a female child ghost, vomiting. He works out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. In her room, Kyra gives Cole a videotape that he gives to her father. The tape reveals that her stepmother poisoned her food, alerting her father to the cause of her death and saving her younger sister. Cole is given a lead part in his school play. He is coached by a ghost director and gives his performance with Malcolm looking on. Before leaving, Cole suggests that Malcolm try speaking to Anna while she is asleep so he can hear her thoughts and feelings. Cole tells Lynn his secret. When she does not believe him, he tells her that his late grandmother visits him and describes details from his mother's childhood that he could not have known. Shocked, Lynn finally believes him. Malcolm returns home to find his wedding video playing and Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her. Suddenly, she drops his wedding ring, and he notices that he is not wearing it. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see, Malcolm locates his gunshot injury, and he realizes that he did not survive being shot by Vincent. He has been dead the entire time while working with Cole. Malcolm quickly comes to terms with the fact that he is a ghost and apologizes to Anna for haunting her and not letting her move on. He tells her that she was never second to anything and that he loves her. Anna indicates she is now at peace, and Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.",

                "Review": "I really recently just watched Donnie Darko and I was super blown away by it. I loved the movie's originality, atmosphere, and complexity. All of the characters were interesting and I cared about them. Particularly the acting from Jake Gyllenhaal was truly amazing.",
                "Themes Analysis": "The reason why I’m making this post is to examine the message and themes of Donnie Darko. Because the plot in itself is so complicated, I feel people are too focused on unraveling that to really talk about the actual themes and message of the film. Usually, looking up the analysis of a film would reveal its message and meaning. But doing that with this film only led me to websites talking about the time travel aspect of the movie. This is my first watch of my film, so I think I still need to pick up on a lot. What I saw was a theme of isolation and selflessness.",
                "Character Insights": "Donnie starts out as an isolated, resentful kid who’s cold towards his family. He also discusses with his therapist about dying alone, saying he fears it but also feels it’s unavoidable. I found this interesting as Donnie is quite clearly the cause of his own isolation as a result of his antisocial, cold behavior. He hates being so alone, but is also the cause behind such loneliness.",
                "Selflessness Theme": "I think selflessness/sacrifice is another theme present in the film. Depending on which theory you follow about the time travel stuff, it can be interpreted that Donnie willingly allows himself to be killed by the jet engine that falls through his bedroom.",
                "Foreshadowing": "I also noticed that when Donnie and Gretchen are exiting the theater, the camera clearly focuses on the movie titles. While most are Halloween based, there’s also the movie title of 'The Passion of Christ' - which isn’t a Halloween-y movie at all. I feel this was sort of foreshadowing of Donnie, a chosen person given special gifts who ultimately has to sacrifice himself.",
                "Mother's Role": "His mother also embodies this theme. Rather than be resentful of her son for his issues or his various outbursts, she completely loves him and accepts him.",
                "Final Thoughts": "Ultimately, these themes of isolation and sacrifice connect to form the theme of 'destruction leads to creation'. In the ending of the film, Donnie is afraid to die alone, but seconds before being hit by a jet engine - he starts laughing."

                "Plot": "Sean and Anna are a married couple living in New York City. At the beginning of the film, Sean is heard lecturing to an unseen audience, explaining that he does not believe in reincarnation. Afterwards, Sean goes jogging, collapses, and dies. Ten years later, Anna accepts a marriage proposal from her new fiancé, Joseph. When Clifford, Sean's brother, arrives at Anna's engagement party, his wife Clara excuses herself, saying she forgot to wrap a gift. Instead, she buys a replacement after hurriedly burying the original gift while a young boy secretly looks on. Sometime later, at a party for Anna's mother, the boy sneaks into the apartment and claims to be Sean. At first, Anna dismisses the boy's claim. When Anna receives a letter from him the next day, warning her not to marry Joseph, she realizes the boy truly believes he is her reincarnated husband. That night, Anna and Joseph discuss the letter. Since the building watchman seems to know the boy and that his name is Sean, Joseph calls to obtain more information. When Sean answers the phone, Joseph rushes downstairs to confront him. He takes him to Sean's father and the three of them order Sean to leave Anna alone. Sean refuses to recant his story and Anna watches Sean collapse in his father's arms. Sean leaves a message on Anna's answering machine, which her mother overhears. That day at lunch, Anna's mother mentions that Sean wants to meet Anna in the park and that she will know where exactly. Anna hurries to Central Park and finds Sean waiting in the spot where her husband died. He offers to submit to questioning. Anna's brother-in-law Bob, a doctor, talks to Sean, recording his responses on tape. Sean answers all the questions, even providing intimate details of Anna and Sean's sex life. Sean is brought to Anna's by his mother and he is able to identify parts of the apartment. Everyone except Anna remains doubtful. Anna's family becomes worried, particularly her sister Laura, who treats Sean with contempt. When Anna misses an appointment with her fiancé to spend time with Sean, Joseph begins feeling worried, not merely about the boy but Anna's odd behavior. His jealousy is made plain when he physically attacks Sean. When Sean runs out, Anna follows him and Sean kisses her on the lips. Anna seems convinced by the boy's story and asks Clara and Clifford to meet him. Clara encounters Sean at the door and asks him to visit her later. When Sean visits her, he brings a backpack full of Anna's love letters to Sean. This package was Clara's spiteful engagement gift, which the boy had secretly unearthed and read the night of the party. Clara had been Sean's lover before his death, and he gave the letters to her unopened as proof of his love. Clara had been jealous that Sean would not leave Anna, but at the last moment abandoned her plan to give Anna the letters. When Clara points out to Sean that if he were really a reincarnation, he would have come to her first, Sean runs out, confused. When Anna finds Sean, she suggests they run away and marry when he is of legal age. He tells Anna that he cannot be the reincarnated Sean since he loves her. Anna apologizes to Joseph, and they are married at the beach. Sean writes a long letter apologizing to Anna, wondering why he had the delusion of being her husband. Anna wades into the ocean's edge in anguish after the ceremony. Joseph finds her and leads her back, whispering into her ear.",

                "Production": "Director Jonathan Glazer was interested in making a film about 'the idea of eternal love' and a 'mystery of the heart'. While writing the script, he was not interested in making a ghost story or a 'paranormal piece'. He envisioned a fairy tale structure early on. The initial idea for the film came to him one day when he was in his kitchen: 'There's this little kid and he tells a woman he's her dead husband – and he's ten years old.' Glazer went to Paris to discuss the idea with French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière at his producer's recommendation. Carrière ended up helping Glazer with the story and acted as a script consultant. The director spent eight months going back and forth to Paris every weekend turning one paragraph into three acts. The script went through 21 drafts as Glazer and co-screenwriter Milo Addica worked on the story. With only a few weeks before principal photography was to begin, the two writers decided to refocus the entire film. Originally, the script was about the boy and they changed it to be about the woman instead. 'We aimed to make something robust in which every question leads to another,' said Glazer. 'I'm not a Buddhist and I don't believe in reincarnation; I don't think I could do a film about it if I did. I was more interested in the idea of eternal love. I wanted to make a mystery, the mystery of the heart.'"

Throughout his stay, Craig bonds with various patients in the psychiatric unit, including Bobby, who takes Craig under his wing.

Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in Los Angeles and suggests that he come to stay with her in their childhood hometown of Nyack, New York. He agrees and meets Maggie's husband Lance. Milo is surprised when Lance tells him that he and Maggie are trying to have a baby, as Maggie never expressed a desire for children. Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking contraceptive pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she had been having sex with her scuba instructor Billy. She worries that she is not worthy of Lance, but Milo reassures her. Milo reconnects with his high school English teacher Rich, with whom he had a sexual relationship when he was 15. Rich now has a sixteen-year-old son and is dating a woman. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later, Milo appears at Rich's house while his son is there. This infuriates Rich, who does not want his past exposed. Maggie is also upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich, as she exposed the relationship to end it as well as Rich's teaching career. Milo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, a boy who their father had assured him would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turns out that the bully has a successful happy life, and it is Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he will not kill himself, and he promises to try not to. Lance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, leading Lance to find the contraceptives. Maggie ends the relationship with Billy and returns home where she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no 'marriage', and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide he should do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note and goes to the pool where she had been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to her body, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps into the pool and rescues her. The film closes with the twins at Maggie's house, looking at their new fish tank filled with goldfish.",

                "Summary": "Throughout the film, we see that Arnie is attached to Gilbert's side. After his father's premature death, Gilbert has assumed the responsibility of caring for Arnie, his developmentally delayed younger brother. In addition to being Arnie's caregiver, Gilbert is expected to hold a steady job in order to provide for the family financially. Amy, Gilbert's older sister, assumes the maternal role. She cooks and cleans the family's home, and she even assists in its many repairs. However, it becomes clear that each family member is burdened by their responsibilities. They are still young, and it is evident that their emotional development has been stunted because they have been expected to behave like adults. Once Becky comes to town, the Grape family is pushed to re-evaluate their functionality, their domestic duties, and their own mental health statuses in order to preserve their longevity.",
                "ThemeDetails": [
                    "The opening scene of the campers driving through Endora reveals that Gilbert Grape desires freedom but is ultimately deprived of it. In this way, Endora's vast landscape is, ironically, Gilbert's trap. When Gilbert meets Becky, he begins to understand that she personifies freedom.",
                    "This film, undoubtedly influenced by the cinéma vérité style, provides a realistic depiction of love. We see how each member of the Grape family loves one another.",
                    "The Grape family deviates from the traditional American family. Instead of Bonnie providing for her entire family, the children are forced to provide for their mother.",
                    "Although there are many ways in which courage is represented in the film, the two scenes in which Bonnie moves from the couch demonstrate her courageous spirit.",
                    "As Gilbert, Tucker, and Bobby sit in the town's diner, they ponder the meaning of life and its fleeting nature."
