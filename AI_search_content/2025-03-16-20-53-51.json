It’s gritty, it’s full of badassery, and it’s simply a blast to watch. And while Die Hard is definitely a great movie, plenty of other films accomplish the high-octane fun, action, and story of the film. Here is our list of the best movies like Die Hard. Yippee-ki-yay!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Watch: Home Alone is a Remake of Die Hard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSubscribe for more filmmaking videos like this.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Speed\n\n#### Speed  •  Boarding the Bus\n\nDie Hard has held its place among the ranks of the best action films for its high octane fun and timely laughs. While the balance of great action and comedy is difficult to pull off, Speed does it as great as any other film.\n\nStarring Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper, this 1994 film follows the action of a Los Angeles detective who must save the passengers of a public bus that has been remotely hijacked. The film is full of edge of your seat action fueled by a fun premise.\n\n## Guide to the Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhat Speed lacks in charisma, it makes up for with adrenaline. Fun Fact: the film is directed by Jan de Bont, who was the cinematographer on Die Hard!\n\n## Guide to the Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Olympus Has Fallen\n\n#### Olympus Has Fallen Behind-the-Scenes Featurette\n\nA more recent film that has found a modern plot within the Die Hard structure is Olympus Has Fallen. The film stars Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart. When the President of the United States is kidnapped and the White House is under terrorist control, the fate of the country if left to a disgraced former Secret Service guard, Mike Banning (Butler).\n\nA protagonist trapped in a building under terrorist control attempting to save the day? Sounds pretty Die Hard to us.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe plot is a bit derivative but the action is top shelf thanks to director Antoine Fuqua. If you wrote this one off, you should give it a shot.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Air Force One\n\n#### Opening Scene  •  Air Force One (1997)\n\nAir Force One is a 1997 action-thriller film directed by Wolfgang Petersen, starring Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. It is loosely based on the novel of the same name written by Andrew Wylie.\n\nThe plot follows an aircraft hijacking that leads to an evacuation of the President of the United States (Harrison Ford) aboard Air Force One with no rules as to who can be rescued or how many people can survive.\n\nThis film has many similarities with Die Hard 2: both feature terrorists taking over an aircraft; both feature an unlikely hero who gets inside the terrorist stronghold. Both explore themes like family versus country. If you liked Die Hard, you’ll love Air Force One as well.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe casting alone should get you pumped for this one: Harrison Ford vs. Gary Oldman?! \"Get off my plane\" is still one of the best one-liners in an action film ever.\n\n## Movies Similar to Die Hard\n\n### Sudden Death\n\n#### Sudden Death (1995)  •  The Best Kind of Lunatic Scene\n\nIf you wanna see the best movies like Die Hard, then look no further than Sudden Death.

Johnson, a retired hockey player, must return to duty when terrorists take over the stadium where he was supposed to be playing an exhibition game.\n\nThe movie also stars Powers Boothe and Deborah Unger, who have both starred in multiple Die Hard knockoffs over the years. If you enjoy watching Bruce Willis battle some terrorists (and who doesn’t?) then surely you’ll enjoy Jean-Claude Van Damme do the same.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJCVD is a genre all to himself. He's one of the few leads on this list who was a bonafide action star to take on a Die Hard-esque role.

Hummel.\n\nDirected by Michael Bay, The Rock delivers 121 minutes of thrilling action comparable to Die Hard. Cage and Connery have exquisite chemistry here and I'm not the only one who wants a sequel just to see these two paired up again.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSandwiched between two other Michael Bay classics (Bad Boys and Armageddon), The Rock is spectacular in every sense of the word.

But the original is still one of the best science fiction action films in cinema that should be on anyone’s must-watch list.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as T-800 is sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor so that she cannot give birth to John Connor, humanity’s future savior against Skynet. While it leans more toward science fiction than Die Hard, The Terminator screenplay features some of the most memorable characters in action films.\n\n## Best Movies Like Die Hard\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou can't get much more high-concept than Cameron's Terminator.

It’s been updated to include the new Netflix thriller Carry-On, starring Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman.  Dwayne Johnson’s latest movie Red One did not make this nice list.\n\nIt’s Christmas-movie season, which means lots of films filled with cheer, mistletoe, happy endings, and, for some, the occasional explosion and bursts of submachine-gun fire. There’s a well-established tradition of Christmas movies that feel as comforting as a fire roaring in a hearth covered in festive decorations. But there’s a parallel tradition of holiday movies more akin to watching that flame spread uncontrollably until the house burns down, films set in the zone where yuletide merriment and action movies overlap.\n\nIt’s not a bad place to hang out for the holidays as long as you don’t mind the whizzing bullets. Below, you’ll find some of the best action movies set around Christmas. You’ll also see a few patterns emerge. One writer-director has made using the holiday as a backdrop for action chaos into a signature, and New York cop turned L.A. hero John McClane made a habit out of finding trouble during Christmas. You’ll also notice a somewhat loose definition of the word action, one that includes plenty of traditional action films and a couple of Christmas thrillers that were just too good to leave out. If your taste in holiday films runs more toward pounding fists and crashing cars than dancing sugar plums, read on.\n\n## 14.\nViolent Night (2022)\n\nWith David Harbour as a Santa Claus who discovers kicking the asses of a bunch of criminals is just what he needs, Violent Night has a clever premise but never really figures out where to take it once the novelty of watching Santa rack up a body count wears off. It often plays like a slightly tongue-in-cheek Die Hard riff that just happens to have Santa in it. But highlights like an extended homage to Home Alone and Harbour’s performance should make it worth a look for the curious, even if those expecting the ultimate badass Christmas action movie are likely to be a little disappointed.\n\n## 13.\n     Invasion U.S.A. (1985)\n\nIn its 1980s heyday, Cannon Films made a fortune flooding the market with modestly budgeted genre movies. Sometimes these were attempts to exploit the latest pop-culture trend, as with Breakin’, but the studio specialized in action movies with recognizable stars and a dash (or more) of right-wing politics. Hysterical (in every sense), Invasion U.S.A. imagines an America thrown into chaos by a holiday-season influx of commie terrorists who can only be stopped by one man: Cannon fixture Chuck Norris, who stars as retired CIA agent Matt Hunter. The film’s amazing centerpiece scene finds Hunter battling gun-toting baddies in a shopping mall filled with Christmas decorations and terrified shoppers.\n\n## 12.\nReindeer Games (2000)\n\nJohn Frankenheimer’s last theatrically released film isn’t one of the director’s best, but time has been kind to it, in no small part because it’s not easy to take any Frankenheimer film for granted since his death in 2002. He largely spent the back half of his career as a studio craftsman, a steady hand who could be brought in for work-for-hire jobs like an attempt to salvage The Island of Dr. Moreau from disaster (an impossible task) and still had the potential to turn out an action classic like Ronin. Headed by a pair of then-rising stars, Reindeer Games stars Ben Affleck as Rudy Duncan, a recently released convict who poses as a dead friend named Nick in order to meet Ashley (Charlize Theron), the pen-pal girlfriend Nick never met. Trouble finds him in the form of Ashley’s brother, Gabriel (Gary Sinise), and a series of twists and turns lead to Rudy getting roped into a scheme to rob a casino when all he really wants to do is join his family for Christmas. It’s never quite as good as it ought to be, but any movie that puts Affleck in cowboy and Santa costumes and features Isaac Hayes and Dennis Farina can’t be all bad.\n\n## 11.\nThe Tower (2012)\n\nAn extended riff on The Towering Inferno, this South Korean disaster movie follows an expansive cast of characters who find themselves trapped in a pair of connected skyscrapers as they’re engulfed by flames. The source of those flames: a Christmas celebration that climaxes with ten helicopters dropping fake snow on the partygoers, a stunt that turns out to be a bad idea because of strong winds and some not-up-to-code fire extinguishers. Alternately silly and melodramatic but consistently fun, it probably features more Christmas miracles per minute than any other movie on this list.\n\n## 10.\nCarry-On (2024)\n\nCarry-On doesn’t waste any time letting viewers know that (a) it’s going to be a tense thriller and (b) Christmas will play a major role. As Bruce Springsteen’s “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town” plays on the radio, a shadowy figure arrives at a Christmas tree lot, then proceeds to kill its shady operators. Shorthand doesn’t get much shorter than that. Written by T.J. Fixman and directed with no-nonsense efficiency by Jaume Collet-Serra, the film squeezes a lot of possibilities out of a clever premise: On the busiest travel day of the year, Ethan (Taron Egerton), a TSA agent, is slipped an earpiece and told that he must let one suspicious-looking piece of luggage pass through or the bad guys will kill his wife (Sofia Carson). It might have been the perfect plan, but Ethan’s tormenter (Jason Bateman) soon finds himself locked into an unexpected battle of wits as Ethan keeps trying to find new ways not to comply without losing the love of his life. A fun cat-and-mouse game that makes excellent use of its airport setting, it’s the rare action movie that owes more to the second Die Hard movie than the first.\n\n## 9.\nThe Long Kiss Goodnight (1996)\n\nThis Renny Harlin–directed movie hinges on a different sort of Christmas miracle. Geena Davis stars as Samantha Caine, a woman who’s put together a pretty nice life for herself and her daughter eight years after mysteriously turning up in New Jersey with no memories of her past life. It all starts to come back to her, however, after a Christmas-season car accident leaves her with a concussion. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars as a private detective drawn into Samantha’s dangerous world, and this underrated-in-its-time film represents something of a Christmas–action movie convergence: Harlin also directed Die Hard 2, and it was scripted by Shane Black (more on both below).\n\n## 8.\nDie Hard 2 (1990)\n\nSpeaking of Die Hard 2, the second entry in what would become an ongoing series finds John McClane (Bruce Willis) once again fighting terrorists to save his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at the height of the holidays. But instead of being stuck in a skyscraper, Holly’s high in the skies aboard a plane that’s been caught in the crossfire of an elaborate scheme involving a notorious military leader’s attempt to escape after being extradited to the United States. The film is bigger, louder, and more violent than the original. It never quite lives up to its predecessor, but it’s fun in its own clamorous way.\n\n## 7.\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)\n\nShane Black has made this list once already and he’ll make it again before we’re through. In fact, if Black’s Christmas-themed movies wouldn’t overwhelm the list, he might even make it a few more times. Christmas factors, in ways both large and small, into the fabric of Black-scripted (and sometimes directed) films from Last Action Hero to Iron Man 3 to The Nice Guys, all compelling in their own way. So let Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Black’s directorial debut, stand in for all of the above in part because Christmas is so central, narratively and thematically, to its plot. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Harry, a New York thief who ends up in L.A. after accidentally stumbling into an audition. Once there, he gets wrapped up in a mystery, befriends a private eye named Perry (Val Kilmer), and reconnects with Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), a childhood crush. The film is filled with unexpected turns, but it’s also the story of lost people looking for redemption who make an unexpected connection in the midst of peril and a Los Angeles all decked out for yuletide.\n\n## 6.\nThe Ice Harvest (2005)\n\nGroundhog Day director Harold Ramis made comedies about redemption and the innate goodness at the heart of humanity — except when he didn’t. Working from a script by Richard Russo and Robert Benton, this noirish thriller stars John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton as shady characters who’ll have it made if they can just get out of Wichita on Christmas Eve. As the title suggests, an ice storm makes that task nearly impossible as twists and double-crosses further complicate their attempts. Dark, misanthropic, and consistently funny, it’s a jolting alternative to a season that’s supposed to be defined by peace on Earth and good will toward men.\n\n## 5.\nHome Alone (1990)\n\nYes, this John Hughes–scripted, Chris Columbus–directed holiday staple is filled with twinkly comedy and heartwarming moments. But it’s also a film about a kid who learns that survival sometimes means acts of extreme violence. The film’s final act is more Straw Dogs than It’s a Wonderful Life  as young Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) uses a variety of household items to inflict grievous bodily harm on the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), a pair of bungling bad guys who mistakenly believe him to be an easy target.\n\n## 4.\nBatman Returns (1992)\n\nEven the most terrifying cities have to celebrate the holidays, and this first sequel to Batman finds Gotham City transformed into a wonderland of festive lights and colorful decorations. It looks like a place where nothing could go wrong. Then, of course, it does thanks to the arrival of the Penguin (Danny DeVito), a malformed criminal mastermind who schemes to bend the city to his will. There’s a lot more going on in Tim Burton’s second Batman film — which also features Michelle Pfeiffer’s Catwoman and Christopher Walken as an evil industrialist — and none of it has that much to do with Christmas. But the winter cheer constantly proves an ironic counterpoint to all the darkness.\n\n## 3.\nThe Silent Partner (1978)\n\nThe plot of this twisty (and twisted) thriller unfolds between Christmas and Easter, but some of its tensest moments cast the season’s cheeriest elements in a sinister light. Elliott Gould stars as Miles Cullen, a teller at a bank inside a large shopping mall. After putting together a few clues, Miles comes to realize his workplace will soon be the target for a bank robber (Christopher Plummer) posing as a mall Santa and decides to cut himself in on the action — with disastrous consequences once the bad guy figures out he’s been robbed. Plummer is so menacing in the role he makes the many killer-Santa movies that followed look almost tame by comparison.\n\n## 2.\nLethal Weapon (1987)\n\nShane Black’s breakthrough screenplay immediately established why he considers Christmas more than just a neat backdrop for an action film. Mel Gibson stars as Martin Riggs, an LAPD detective who’s scarred by his service in Vietnam and, more recently, the death of his wife. Through his partnership with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), he climbs out of suicidal despair and regains his will to live. Oh, sure, there’s a twisty plot and some standout action scenes, but at its heart, this Richard Donner–directed film is a story of grace and redemption that just happens to take the form of an action movie.\n\n## 1.\nDie Hard (1988)\n\nThe same can be said for the greatest of all Christmas action movies. Directed by John McTiernan, Die Hard is the story of John McClane attempting to reconcile with his semi-estranged wife, Holly. He encounters some complications along the way, however, when a group of armed bad guys, led by the sneering Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), take over the towering L.A. office building where Holly works. For all its flying bullets and blood-soaked feet, it’s a story of togetherness and self-sacrifice. Every once in a while, the internet will erupt in debate about whether Die Hard qualifies as a Christmas movie. It’s the wrong question. A better one: If it’s not a Christmas movie, then what is?\n\n### Related\n\n- 16 Great Christmas Movies That Aren’t Christmas Movies\n- 19 Christmas Horror Movies You Can Watch Right Now\n\n### Tags:\n\n- vulture lists\n- vulture picks\n- action movies\n- die hard\n- violent night\n- lethal weapon\n- shane black\n- home alone\n- holiday movie zone\n- More\n\nThings you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission.\n\n### Most Viewed Stories\n\n- The 9 Best Movies and TV Shows to Watch This Weekend\n- Cinematrix No. 355: March 16, 2025\n- Severance Recap: A Momentous Day\n- What Hollywood Is Saying About Disney’s Snow White Crisis\n- Netflix’s The Electric State Is a $320 Million Piece of Junk\n\n- The 9 Best Movies and TV Shows to Watch This Weekend\n- Severance Recap: A Momentous Day\n- What Hollywood Is Saying About Disney’s Snow White Crisis\n- Netflix’s The Electric State Is a $320 Million Piece of Junk\n- Cinematrix No. 355: March 16, 2025\n\n### Most Popular\n\n- The 9 Best Movies and TV Shows to Watch This Weekend\n- Cinematrix No. 355: March 16, 2025\n- Severance Recap: A Momentous Day\n- What Hollywood Is Saying About Disney’s Snow White Crisis\n- Netflix’s The Electric State Is a $320 Million Piece of Junk\n\n- The 9 Best Movies and TV Shows to Watch This Weekend\n- Severance Recap: A Momentous Day\n- What Hollywood Is Saying About Disney’s Snow White Crisis\n- Netflix’s The Electric State Is a $320 Million Piece of Junk\n- Cinematrix No. 355: March 16, 2025\n\n### Latest News from Vulture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##\n\n##\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\n             and\n             apply.\n\n#\n\nAlready a subscriber?\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\nThis password will be used to sign into all  sites.

                "Commentary": "The world's biggest online community about The Matrix franchise, created by the visionary minds of Lana and Lilly Wachowski! A question inspired by the actor Bernard White (who played Sati’s father in M2 and M3) and in the more recent past blogged this rant in defence of the third movie: “I was able to do this the second time I saw THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. I have now seen it an additional 5 times. Making it an even 7. The movie is nothing, I mean nothing, short of brilliant. The depth and complexity is well worth the closer look, that, it seems to me, some of these critics were not willing to take. It seemed to me that they did not want to risk falling in love with this film. Why? I believe it has to do with betrayal. Not wanting to be betrayed, not wanting to buy into the overdone hype of the Warner Brothers Publicity Machine. Not wanting to reward this quiet underground discovery of theirs turned Hollywood Blockbuster. They will, of course, site things like “wooden performances” and “clunky dialogue”. An “uneven and confusing storytelling” that they feel amounts to a kind of sound and fury signifying nothing.

Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third film in the Die Hard film series after Die Hard 2 and was later followed by Live Free or Die Hard and A Good Day to Die Hard.\n\nThe film stars Bruce Willis as NYPD Lieutenant John McClane and Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver. McClane and Carver team up to stop an East German terrorist group headed by \"Simon\" (Jeremy Irons), who have planted bombs across New York City and plot to steal the gold bullion of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The film was released on May 19, 1995, and it initially received mixed reviews and became the highest-grossing film of the year.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe Bonwit Teller department store in New York City is blown up by a bomb during the morning commute. A man identifying himself as \"Simon\" telephones the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and claims responsibility. Making demands in the form of a 'Simon Says' game, he threatens to detonate another bomb unless Lt. John McClane is sent to Harlem wearing an intentionally provocative sandwich board. The NYPD comply and send McClane to Harlem, where he is confronted by an electrician and shop owner named Zeus Carver. McClane explains his situation before a group of gang members also confront McClane over his sign. Carver intervenes and saves McClane, and they escape in a taxi.\n\nThey arrive at 1 Police Plaza, where Simon demands that the pair follow a timed challenge or he will set off more bombs. They agree and McClane eventually boards the 3 train heading towards the Wall Street station in order to defuse a bomb that Simon planted on it. Carver arrives at the station before McClane finds the bomb and throws it on the tracks just as it explodes. McClane and Carver regroup with the NYPD and meet some FBI and CIA agents, who initially inform the pair that Simon is \"Peter Krieg\", a mercenary and former colonel in the National People's Army. They then reveal that Krieg's real name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, who McClane killed years earlier in Los Angeles.[b]\n\nSimon then places another call to the NYPD, informing them that he has planted an explosive in one of the city's elementary schools which is set to explode once class ends and can be triggered by the same radio frequencies utilized by law enforcement. Simon offers to give the authorities the school's location if McClane and Carver follow another timed challenge, warning that he will detonate the explosive if any evacuation attempts are carried out. While the pair solve Simon's next challenge, the NYPD begin to search all elementary schools in the city. McClane realizes that Simon is attempting to distract the NYPD away from Wall Street, which has no schools, and travels to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building. He discovers that Simon's men have stolen $140 billion of gold bullion from its vault using dump trucks. He follows the trucks into the under-construction New York City Water Tunnel No. 3 while Carver continues Simon's challenges.\n\nSimon blows up a cofferdam to flood the tunnel, but McClane escapes and reunites with Carver. Surviving a car chase with Simon's men, the pair find all the men were carrying exactly enough money to pay a bridge toll. The pair sneak aboard a tanker docked in the Long Island Sound, but Simon's associates capture them and tie them up next to a bomb. Simon explains that his school threat was fake and broadcasts a message claiming that he is planning on destroying the tanker filled with the bullion to destabilize the Western world's economy. After he leaves, Carver and McClane free themselves and escape the tanker just before the bomb detonates. As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the NYPD, McClane informs them that none of the bullion Simon's men stole was in the tanker's cargo hold, having deduced that Simon had intended to keep all of it for himself, using his knowledge of the Gruber family's modus operandi.\n\nWhile attempting to place a call to his estranged wife Holly, McClane glances at a bottle of aspirin given to him by Simon onboard the tanker and notices that it was purchased at a truck stop in Quebec on the Canada–United States border. McClane informs the NYPD of his discovery, and joins them and Carver as they rush towards a warehouse near the truck stop where Simon and his men are redistributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are quickly apprehended by law enforcement personnel, though Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, attacking McClane. McClane shoots at an overhead power line which falls onto the helicopter, causing it to crash and explode, killing Simon and Katya. While they are celebrating their triumph, Carver persuades McClane to place another call to Holly.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Bruce Willis as John McClane\n- Jeremy Irons as Simon Peter Gruber\n- Samuel L.

Various scripts were written for Die Hard 3; a number of them were ultimately rejected by Bruce Willis on the grounds that they felt like retreads of the action movies that came in the wake of the first film.[5] One script, originally titled Troubleshooter, had McClane fighting terrorists on a Caribbean cruise line, but was rejected for being too similar to Under Siege.[6] Troubleshooter was later repurposed for Speed 2: Cruise Control.[5]\n\nThe script ultimately used was intended for a film entitled Simon Says, originally positioned as a Brandon Lee vehicle and the character of Zeus was written with an actress in mind, but the project was cancelled after Lee's death during filming of The Crow. Warner Bros. bought the script and rewrote it as a Lethal Weapon sequel. Warner Bros. later put the script in turnaround, only to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and rewritten as a Die Hard film.[5]\n\nAndy Vajna replaced Joel Silver and Larry Gordon as the producer on the film due to a fall-out with Willis.[6] As a result, Vajna's company, Cinergi, acquired foreign rights to the film. In most regions, the film rights were acquired by Disney and Summit Entertainment, while Fox retained domestic and Japan rights.[1] In July 1997, Cinergi sold its 50% stake in the film to Fox for $11.25 million.[7]\n\n### Casting\n\nLaurence Fishburne was originally offered the co-starring role of Zeus Carver, a part also written for him, but wanted a higher fee. Producer Andy Vajna held out on the deal. Fishburne had earlier turned down the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction, which was eventually played by Samuel L. Jackson. Fishburne was talked out of playing Jules by his representatives who wanted him to only accept leading parts, otherwise he would be stuck career-wise as a supporting actor. Subsequently, Pulp Fiction premiered at the Cannes Film Festival during the same time as Fishburne's pay negotiations. Vajna also attended the event to support Willis who was appearing in the Quentin Tarantino film. Tarantino recalled that Vajna was so impressed by Jackson's performance that he offered him the part of Carver instead. Fishburne later filed a lawsuit against Vajna's company Cinergi for reneging on a verbal agreement.[8][9] The lawsuit was settled before going to trial, with Fishburne receiving $750,000 and a guarantee that Cinergi would option a screenplay he had written.[10][11]\n\n## Music\n\nMichael Kamen returned to score the third film, again incorporating other material into his score (most notably \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\", not included on the soundtrack album). Excerpts from his scores for Die Hard and Die Hard 2 were also included in the new film. The soundtrack was released by RCA Victor.[citation needed] In 2012, La-La Land Records released an expanded version of the soundtrack, containing music that Kamen had composed but went unused in the final film.[12]\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Die Hard with a Vengeance did not take place during Christmas, but instead being set during the late summer. It opened in theaters on May 19, 1995, five years after Die Hard 2. Despite concerns about the film portraying bomb threats and terrorism with the Oklahoma City bombing having occurred the previous month, the film was released as originally scheduled.[13]\n\n### Home media\n\nDie Hard with a Vengeance was released on VHS on December 19, 1995, in the United States by Fox Video with a THX-certified version, while it was released in international countries by Touchstone Home Entertainment and released in South Africa on VHS by Ster-Kinekor Home Video.[14] It was then released on LaserDisc on January 17, 1996, and on DVD on March 9, 1999. A special edition was released on DVD on July 10, 2001, and then re-released in February 2005 and 2007.[15] The film was released on Blu-ray in 2007 and 2013.[16] A 4K release of the film has been made available for digital purchase on services such Apple TV, Amazon Video, and the Microsoft Store, plus free 4K streaming on select platforms such as Disney+.[17]\n\n#### Alternative ending\n\nAn alternative ending to the one shown in the final movie was filmed with Jeremy Irons and Bruce Willis, set some time after the events in New York. It can be found on the Special Edition DVD. In this version, it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, and that McClane was used as the scapegoat for everything that went wrong. He is fired from the NYPD after more than 20 years on the force and the FBI has even taken away his pension; it is also mentioned that McClane and his wife Holly have divorced. Nevertheless, he still manages to track Simon using the batch number on the bottle of aspirins and they meet in a bar in Hungary. In this version, Simon has double-crossed most of his accomplices, gotten the loot to a safe hiding place somewhere in Hungary, and has the gold turned into statuettes of the Empire State Building in order to smuggle it out of the country. McClane is keen to take his problems out on Simon, who he invites to play a game called \"McClane Says\". This involves a form of Russian roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher that has had the sights removed, meaning it is impossible to determine which end is which. McClane then asks Simon some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Simon gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which fires the rocket through Simon, killing him.[18][19]\n\nIn the DVD audio commentary, screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh claims that this version was dropped because the studio thought it showed a more cruel and menacing side to McClane, a man who killed for revenge rather than in self-defense. The studio was also displeased with the lack of action in the scene, feeling that it did not fit as a \"climax\" and therefore chose to reshoot the finale as an action sequence at a significant monetary cost. Hensleigh's intention was to show that the events in New York and the subsequent repercussions had tilted McClane psychologically. This alternative ending, set some time after the film's main events, would have marked a serious break from the Die Hard formula, in which the plot unfolds over a period of roughly 12 hours.[19]\n\nAccording to the DVD audio commentary, a second alternative ending had McClane and Carver floating back to shore on a makeshift raft after the explosion at sea. Carver says it is a shame the bad guys are going to get away; McClane tells him not to be so sure. The scene then shifts to the boat where the terrorists find the briefcase bomb they left in the park and which Carver gave back to them (in this version it was not used to blow up the dam). The film would end on a darkly comic note as Simon asks if anyone has a four-gallon jug. This draft of the script was rejected early on – possibly due to the similarity of the ending to Die Hard 2, where all the villains board a plane that later explodes – so it was never actually filmed. The rocket-launcher sequence was the only alternative ending to be filmed.[19]\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nDie Hard with a Vengeance opened in the United States on May 19, 1995, and earned $22,162,245 in its opening weekend.[20][21] The film ranked number one at the box office, beating  Crimson Tide.[20] In Japan, it set a record opening for 20th Century Fox with a five-day gross of $13.5 million, beating Return of the Jedi and ranking number one for five consecutive weeks, grossing over $81 million.[c] Its opening in France set a summer record with a gross of $8.8 million in its first 8 days.[23] The film went on to gross $100,012,499 in the United States and Canada, and $266,089,167 in other markets, giving it a total worldwide gross of $366,101,666 and making it the highest-grossing film of 1995.[4][25]\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Die Hard with a Vengeance gets off to a fast start and benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas.\"[26] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[27] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[28]\n\nRoger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, praising the action sequences and the performances of Willis, Jackson, and Irons, concluding: \"Die Hard with a Vengeance is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.\"[29] Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman disliked the film, stating that while \"[John] McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse... they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole\".[30]\n\nJames Berardinelli thought that the explosions and fights were \"filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right\".[31] Samuel L. Jackson's performance in the film was also praised by critics. Desson Howe of The Washington Post thought that \"the best thing about the movie is the relationship between McClane and Zeus,\" saying that Jackson was \"almost as good as he was in Pulp Fiction.\"[32] For Variety, Brian Lowry wrote the film was the \"least accomplished\" of the Die Hard series, but \"even a subpar adventure won't kill this series, as the pic's built-in audience will make it a major summer attraction, if perhaps one lacking quite the stamina of the first two movies\".[33]\n\nEmpire magazine's Ian Nathan gave the film a three out of five stars review, stating that \"Die Hard with a Vengeance is better than Die Hard 2, but not as good as the peerless original. Though it's breathless fun, the film runs out of steam in the last act. And Jeremy Irons' villain isn't fit to tie Alan Rickman's shoelaces.\"[34]\n\nIn the Crime Time Filmbook, which archives various UK film reviews, the film was given a perfect 5-star review, citing it as \"...simply the best Action film of the decade, leaving imitators like Bad Boys, Executive Decision, The Rock and Chain Reaction in varying depths of shadow.[35]\n\nRetrospective rankings have called the film the best sequel in the franchise.[d] Empire considered it to be one of the 50 greatest film sequels in 2009.[40] Ben Sherlock of Screen Rant regarded it as the best sequel of the franchise.[41] Johnny Hoffman from Movieweb considered it a step up from the previous film and praised Willis and Jackson's chemistry and the action scenes.[39]\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ Cinergi pre-sold the worldwide distribution rights except for Japan to Buena Vista International in some regions[2][3] and assigned Summit Entertainment as sales agent for other regions.[1]\n- ^ As depicted in Die Hard (1988).\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[22][23][24][4]\n- ^ Attributed to multiple references:[36][37][38][39]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ a b c \"Die Hard with a Vengeance script\".

Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third film in the Die Hard film series after Die Hard 2 and was later followed by Live Free or Die Hard and A Good Day to Die Hard.\n\nThe film stars <MainActors><Actor>Bruce Willis</Actor>, <Actor>Samuel L. Jackson</Actor>, and <Actor>Jeremy Irons</Actor></MainActors> as NYPD Lieutenant John McClane and McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver. McClane and Carver team up to stop an East German terrorist group headed by \"Simon\" (<MainActors><Actor>Jeremy Irons</Actor></MainActors>), who have planted bombs across New York City and plot to steal the gold bullion of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The film was released on <ReleaseYear>May 19, 1995</ReleaseYear> and it initially received mixed reviews and became the highest-grossing film of the year.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe Bonwit Teller department store in New York City is blown up by a bomb during the morning commute. A man identifying himself as \"Simon\" telephones the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and claims responsibility. Making demands in the form of a 'Simon Says' game, he threatens to detonate another bomb unless Lt. John McClane is sent to Harlem wearing an intentionally provocative sandwich board. The NYPD comply and send McClane to Harlem, where he is confronted by an electrician and shop owner named Zeus Carver. McClane explains his situation before a group of gang members also confront McClane over his sign. Carver intervenes and saves McClane, and they escape in a taxi.\n\nThey arrive at 1 Police Plaza, where Simon demands that the pair follow a timed challenge or he will set off more bombs. They agree and McClane eventually boards the 3 train heading towards the Wall Street station in order to defuse a bomb that Simon planted on it. Carver arrives at the station before McClane finds the bomb and throws it on the tracks just as it explodes. McClane and Carver regroup with the NYPD and meet some FBI and CIA agents, who initially inform the pair that Simon is \"Peter Krieg\", a mercenary and former colonel in the National People's Army. They then reveal that Krieg's real name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, who McClane killed years earlier in Los Angeles.\n\nSimon then places another call to the NYPD, informing them that he has planted an explosive in one of the city's elementary schools which is set to explode once class ends and can be triggered by the same radio frequencies utilized by law enforcement. Simon offers to give the authorities the school's location if McClane and Carver follow another timed challenge, warning that he will detonate the explosive if any evacuation attempts are carried out. While the pair solve Simon's next challenge, the NYPD begin to search all elementary schools in the city. McClane realizes that Simon is attempting to distract the NYPD away from Wall Street, which has no schools, and travels to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building. He discovers that Simon's men have stolen $140 billion of gold bullion from its vault using dump trucks. He follows the trucks into the under-construction New York City Water Tunnel No. 3 while Carver continues Simon's challenges.\n\nSimon blows up a cofferdam to flood the tunnel, but McClane escapes and reunites with Carver. Surviving a car chase with Simon's men, the pair find all the men were carrying exactly enough money to pay a bridge toll. The pair sneak aboard a tanker docked in the Long Island Sound, but Simon's associates capture them and tie them up next to a bomb. Simon explains that his school threat was fake and broadcasts a message claiming that he is planning on destroying the tanker filled with the bullion to destabilize the Western world's economy. After he leaves, Carver and McClane free themselves and escape the tanker just before the bomb detonates. As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the NYPD, McClane informs them that none of the bullion Simon's men stole was in the tanker's cargo hold, having deduced that Simon had intended to keep all of it for himself, using his knowledge of the Gruber family's modus operandi.\n\nWhile attempting to place a call to his estranged wife Holly, McClane glances at a bottle of aspirin given to him by Simon onboard the tanker and notices that it was purchased at a truck stop in Quebec on the Canada–United States border. McClane informs the NYPD of his discovery, and joins them and Carver as they rush towards a warehouse near the truck stop where Simon and his men are redistributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are quickly apprehended by law enforcement personnel, though Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, attacking McClane. McClane shoots at an overhead power line which falls onto the helicopter, causing it to crash and explode, killing Simon and Katya. While they are celebrating their triumph, Carver persuades McClane to place another call to Holly.\n\n## Cast\n\n- <MainActors><Actor>Bruce Willis</Actor></MainActors> as John McClane\n- <MainActors><Actor>Jeremy Irons</Actor></MainActors> as Simon Peter Gruber\n- <MainActors><Actor>Samuel L.

Various scripts were written for Die Hard 3; a number of them were ultimately rejected by Bruce Willis on the grounds that they felt like retreads of the action movies that came in the wake of the first film. One script, originally titled Troubleshooter, had McClane fighting terrorists on a Caribbean cruise line, but was rejected for being too similar to Under Siege. Troubleshooter was later repurposed for Speed 2: Cruise Control.\n\nThe script ultimately used was intended for a film entitled Simon Says, originally positioned as a Brandon Lee vehicle and the character of Zeus was written with an actress in mind, but the project was cancelled after Lee's death during filming of The Crow. Warner Bros. bought the script and rewrote it as a Lethal Weapon sequel. Warner Bros. later put the script in turnaround, only to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and rewritten as a Die Hard film.\n\nAndy Vajna replaced Joel Silver and Larry Gordon as the producer on the film due to a fall-out with Willis. As a result, Vajna's company, Cinergi, acquired foreign rights to the film. In most regions, the film rights were acquired by Disney and Summit Entertainment, while Fox retained domestic and Japan rights. In July 1997, Cinergi sold its 50% stake in the film to Fox for $11.25 million.\n\n### Casting\n\nLaurence Fishburne was originally offered the co-starring role of Zeus Carver, a part also written for him, but wanted a higher fee. Producer Andy Vajna held out on the deal. Fishburne had earlier turned down the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction, which was eventually played by Samuel L. Jackson. Fishburne was talked out of playing Jules by his representatives who wanted him to only accept leading parts, otherwise he would be stuck career-wise as a supporting actor. Subsequently, Pulp Fiction premiered at the Cannes Film Festival during the same time as Fishburne's pay negotiations. Vajna also attended the event to support Willis who was appearing in the Quentin Tarantino film. Tarantino recalled that Vajna was so impressed by Jackson's performance that he offered him the part of Carver instead. Fishburne later filed a lawsuit against Vajna's company Cinergi for reneging on a verbal agreement. The lawsuit was settled before going to trial, with Fishburne receiving $750,000 and a guarantee that Cinergi would option a screenplay he had written.\n\n## Music\n\nMichael Kamen returned to score the third film, again incorporating other material into his score (most notably \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\", not included on the soundtrack album). Excerpts from his scores for Die Hard and Die Hard 2 were also included in the new film. The soundtrack was released by RCA Victor. In 2012, La-La Land Records released an expanded version of the soundtrack, containing music that Kamen had composed but went unused in the final film.\n\n## Release\n\n### Theatrical\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Die Hard with a Vengeance did not take place during Christmas, but instead being set during the late summer. It opened in theaters on <ReleaseYear>May 19, 1995</ReleaseYear>, five years after Die Hard 2. Despite concerns about the film portraying bomb threats and terrorism with the Oklahoma City bombing having occurred the previous month, the film was released as originally scheduled.\n\n### Home media\n\nDie Hard with a Vengeance was released on VHS on December 19, 1995, in the United States by Fox Video with a THX-certified version, while it was released in international countries by Touchstone Home Entertainment and released in South Africa on VHS by Ster-Kinekor Home Video. It was then released on LaserDisc on January 17, 1996, and on DVD on March 9, 1999. A special edition was released on DVD on July 10, 2001, and then re-released in February 2005 and 2007. The film was released on Blu-ray in 2007 and 2013. A 4K release of the film has been made available for digital purchase on services such as Apple TV, Amazon Video, and the Microsoft Store, plus free 4K streaming on select platforms such as Disney+.\n\n#### Alternative ending\n\nAn alternative ending to the one shown in the final movie was filmed with Jeremy Irons and Bruce Willis, set some time after the events in New York. It can be found on the Special Edition DVD. In this version, it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, and that McClane was used as the scapegoat for everything that went wrong. He is fired from the NYPD after more than 20 years on the force and the FBI has even taken away his pension; it is also mentioned that McClane and his wife Holly have divorced. Nevertheless, he still manages to track Simon using the batch number on the bottle of aspirins and they meet in a bar in Hungary. In this version, Simon has double-crossed most of his accomplices, gotten the loot to a safe hiding place somewhere in Hungary, and has the gold turned into statuettes of the Empire State Building in order to smuggle it out of the country. McClane is keen to take his problems out on Simon, who he invites to play a game called \"McClane Says\". This involves a form of Russian roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher that has had the sights removed, meaning it is impossible to determine which end is which. McClane then asks Simon some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Simon gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which fires the rocket through Simon, killing him.\n\nIn the DVD audio commentary, screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh claims that this version was dropped because the studio thought it showed a more cruel and menacing side to McClane, a man who killed for revenge rather than in self-defense. The studio was also displeased with the lack of action in the scene, feeling that it did not fit as a \"climax\" and therefore chose to reshoot the finale as an action sequence at a significant monetary cost. Hensleigh's intention was to show that the events in New York and the subsequent repercussions had tilted McClane psychologically. This alternative ending, set some time after the film's main events, would have marked a serious break from the Die Hard formula, in which the plot unfolds over a period of roughly 12 hours.\n\nAccording to the DVD audio commentary, a second alternative ending had McClane and Carver floating back to shore on a makeshift raft after the explosion at sea. Carver says it is a shame the bad guys are going to get away; McClane tells him not to be so sure. The scene then shifts to the boat where the terrorists find the briefcase bomb they left in the park and which Carver gave back to them (in this version it was not used to blow up the dam). The film would end on a darkly comic note as Simon asks if anyone has a four-gallon jug. This draft of the script was rejected early on – possibly due to the similarity of the ending to Die Hard 2, where all the villains board a plane that later explodes – so it was never actually filmed. The rocket-launcher sequence was the only alternative ending to be filmed.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nDie Hard with a Vengeance opened in the United States on <ReleaseYear>May 19, 1995</ReleaseYear> and earned $22,162,245 in its opening weekend. The film ranked number one at the box office, beating Crimson Tide. In Japan, it set a record opening for 20th Century Fox with a five-day gross of $13.5 million, beating Return of the Jedi and ranking number one for five consecutive weeks, grossing over $81 million. Its opening in France set a summer record with a gross of $8.8 million in its first 8 days. The film went on to gross $100,012,499 in the United States and Canada, and $266,089,167 in other markets, giving it a total worldwide gross of $366,101,666 and making it the highest-grossing film of 1995.\n\n### Critical response\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Die Hard with a Vengeance gets off to a fast start and benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, praising the action sequences and the performances of Willis, Jackson, and Irons, concluding: \"Die Hard with a Vengeance is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.\" Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman disliked the film, stating that while \"[John] McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse... they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole\".\n\nJames Berardinelli thought that the explosions and fights were \"filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right\". Samuel L. Jackson's performance in the film was also praised by critics. Desson Howe of The Washington Post thought that \"the best thing about the movie is the relationship between McClane and Zeus,\" saying that Jackson was \"almost as good as he was in Pulp Fiction.\" For Variety, Brian Lowry wrote the film was the \"least accomplished\" of the Die Hard series, but \"even a subpar adventure won't kill this series, as the pic's built-in audience will make it a major summer attraction, if perhaps one lacking quite the stamina of the first two movies.\"\n\nEmpire magazine's Ian Nathan gave the film a three out of five stars review, stating that \"Die Hard with a Vengeance is better than Die Hard 2, but not as good as the peerless original. Though it's breathless fun, the film runs out of steam in the last act. And Jeremy Irons' villain isn't fit to tie Alan Rickman's shoelaces.\"\n\nIn the Crime Time Filmbook, which archives various UK film reviews, the film was given a perfect 5-star review, citing it as \"...simply the best Action film of the decade, leaving imitators like Bad Boys, Executive Decision, The Rock and Chain Reaction in varying depths of shadow.\n\nRetrospective rankings have called the film the best sequel in the franchise. Empire considered it to be one of the 50 greatest film sequels in 2009. Ben Sherlock of Screen Rant regarded it as the best sequel of the franchise. Johnny Hoffman from Movieweb considered it a step up from the previous film and praised Willis and Jackson's chemistry and the action scenes.\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to highlight the key attributes of the movie while maintaining the original information.

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAPI Changes, spez, etc. You know the drill. We'll be back when other people are coming back online. Go watch some movies in the meantime.\n\nFor more information see /r/ModCoord.\n\n# The Rock (1996). Michael Bay’s Greatest Work\n\nMichael Bay’s best work. The action here remains superior to most modern Hollywood filth. Especially certain set pieces like the bathroom sequence. Yet, amidst the action, one liners, and dumb Alcatraz premise, there is an underlying complexity here that sets this apart from similar action movies. This is mainly because of the three characters that are at the centre of the film.\n\nNic Cage’s character with all his unique quirks combined with a sound moral compass, feels like the ultimate version of the “in over his head” action hero in direct contrast to the invincible action heroes of a decade prior. His arc itself is not revolutionary but him being placed at the centre of such a film along with all his peculiarities being given as much screen time and emphasis as they are, is what makes things interesting. A harmless nerd who just so happens to be a cog in the devastating machine that is chemical warfare, having to witness first hand what the machine is capable of but also ironically being the only person who can stop it because of his expertise.\n\nSean Connery’s character is basically just James Bond if James Bond got caught and spent the last 20 years in prison and had an estranged daughter. This humanization of the Bond character would not be seen until the Craig Bond films. It is his place as the retired super spy in collaboration with the awkward chemist, that provides the film with the most unique possible protagonist duo.\n\nThen there is General Hummel. Ed Harris’ character who is the heart of the film. The complexities of his crusade aside, it is the way it starts and ends that I feel is most telling regarding what the film is trying to convey. The movie opens with a montage of him getting ready to enact his plan while visiting his wife’s grave as some incredible Hans Zimmer music plays in the back. (As an aside I prefer this over Zimmer’s later work) However it ends in the most underwhelming way possible with his own subordinates betraying him. The disillusioned general who lost his faith in those above him cannot even keep his faith in those under him. And even as our protagonists succeed, Hummel’s cause dies with him. The one man powerful and committed enough to stand up to the American war machine along with it’s external and internal damage, is unable to stop it. Yet the spy is reunited with his daughter and the chemist goes back home to his pregnant wife. Even Hummel manages to somewhat redeem himself by the end. Perhaps the film is deeply nihilistic for suggesting that these corrupt and flawed systems cannot be changed. A nihilism that could be a reflection of post Gulf War and Cold War American public sentiments towards the military. But perhaps it is suggesting that individual victories and principled stances are still very possible and even admirable in spite of these systems. Regardless, the politics of the film are complex and nigh impossible to pin down and that is what makes it special.\n\n—————-\n\nHere are some parallels that I noticed between this and the Modern Warfare 2 campaign which obviously heavily borrows from this. There might be more but these are the ones that instantly come to mind:\n\n- The gulag level is designed like Alcatraz from the film\n- The shower level is almost an exact replica of the shower scene here including the verticality\n- There is a level that ends with your character running to a specific location with flairs to prevent a friendly bombing. Basically the same as the climax of the film\n- Captain Price is heavily influenced by Sean Connery’s character here. He is also imprisoned when the game starts, just like Connery’s character\n- Some obvious similarities and parallels between General Shepherd from the game and General Hummel\n\nI also wouldn’t be surprised if Hideo Kojima was influenced by this especially for Metal Gear Solid: 3\n\nCheck out my Letterboxd to keep up with what I watch and write.

Making it PG is lame it's like making Punisher PG13. Blade doesn't need 150 million dollars it can be done with 50 million like Deadpool. It's just meh. You'll probably wont get a scene as memorable or creative as the blood rave scene in Blade 1's opening. With an R rating you can tackle more adult subject matter without having to water it down making it PG13 is just a waste imo. They'll keep Deadpool R but not Blade pass for me.

The filmmakers bought the mansion and destroyed it. The divorcée kept the land and presumably built a new house after clearing out the rubble.\n\n- GoofsAfter the ambush, Jack checks for a pulse with his thumb.

Hill\n\n### User reviews197\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Condensed Clancy\n\nThe makers of this movie are to be congratulated for turning a Tom Clancy doorstop into a tense, tightly woven international thriller with a top notch cast and believeable plot. Where the previous two Jack Ryan movies depended on stunts and quite unbelieveable plot twists this film concentrates on a grubby little military/political incident (more the domain of intelligence men) and the men of honour and integrity (Ford and an under used Dafoe) trapped in the middle of it.\n\nI also like this movie for its subtle dig at the American establishment and how it assumes it can coerce the weak into doing its bidding.\n\nThe Clark character in Clancy's fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this.\n\n- goggy turk\n- Apr 7, 2000\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ27\n\n- How long is Clear and Present Danger?Powered by Alexa\n- Is \"Clear and Present Danger\" based on a book?\n- Is it necessary to watch \"Patriot Games\" before seeing \"Clear and Present Danger\"?\n- Where does the title come from?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - October 6, 1994 (Australia)\n- Countries of origin\n    - United States\n    - Canada\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - Spanish\n- Also known as\n    - Peligro inminente\n- Filming locations\n    - Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico(street scenes)\n- Production companies\n    - Mace Neufeld Productions\n    - Paramount Pictures\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $62,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $122,187,717\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $20,348,017\n    - Aug 7, 1994\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $215,887,717\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime2 hours 21 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n    - DTS\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.39 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat was the official certification given to Clear and Present Danger (1994) in Japan?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\nCANCEL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n# Bad Boys: Ride or Die\n\n## 2024, R, 110 min. Directed by Adil El Arbi, Bilall Fallah. Starring Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Paola Núñez, Eric Dane, Ioan Gruffud, Rhea Seehorn.\n\n#### REVIEWED By Matthew Monagle, Fri., June  7, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFour years may seem like a long time between sequels in modern Hollywood, but when you’re talking about the Bad Boys franchise, that kind of turnaround time is practically a rush job. Given the 8- and 17-year gaps between the previous films, Bad Boys: Ride or Die is probably the least we’ll ever see these characters age between films.\n\nSince we last left Miami’s bad boy police officers, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are embracing getting older. Mike is now married, and Marcus’ biggest source of heartache is the low-carb diet he’s been put on by his family. But when the late Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) reaches out to both men from beyond the grave, they soon find themselves embroiled in a statewide conspiracy that will require them to once more join forces with Armando (Jacob Scipio), Mike’s incarcerated son.\n\nAt this point, the Bad Boys movies are doing a lot of the same things that the Fast and the Furious franchise has done. They expand the cast of regulars, move characters from villains to heroes, and raise the volume on the action sequences to a thunderous level. But that’s the benefit of starting a franchise at the loudest possible volume. Bad Boys came out of the gate unhinged, spending most of its original runtime on a millionaire cop who shoots people for fun and his oversexed partner who complains about his dead bedroom nonstop. It was bad – really bad – but it ensured that the most ridiculous narrative beats had nowhere to go but down.\n\nIf anything, Bad Boys is the Fast and the Furious franchise in reverse. These characters have gotten more grounded with time, and Bad Boys: Ride or Die continues its attempts to humanize Mike by giving him a well-placed panic attack (the tuberculosis of modern action movies: freeze and rally). The series also slyly sidesteps discourse around police movies by putting an on-the-run Mike and Marcus against corrupt law enforcement officers in bed with the cartel. We’ve come a long way from the post-9/11 politics of Bad Boys II; instead of using terrorism to justify any means, Bad Boys: Ride or Die’s plot is constructed around the unchecked systems of power that flourished in the early 2000s.\n\nAnd much credit also belongs to directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the returning directors of Bad Boys for Life, for successfully rehashing a style of filmmaking we thought past its prime. Adil &amp; Bilal – as they are credited onscreen – may be Michael Bay’s greatest students. Both of their Bad Boy films adopt the maximalist stylization of the original films while staging the action sequences in longer takes. This is Michael Bay for the John Wick generation: bombastic filmmaking at its finest with complex, multi-level action sequences that give the stunts room to breathe. One early near-death sequence in particular spotlights an eye for craft that only starts with car crashes and explosions.\n\nIf Bad Boys for Life shocked audiences and critics with its relevance, then Bad Boys: Ride or Die proves that the window for this franchise is, despite all odds, very much still open. As long as the creative team sticks to the script – and Columbia Pictures would be foolish to try and make these movies without Adil &amp; Bilal behind the camera – we may still get one or two more of these movies before the cast has to call it quits. Or at least until they stop dying Will Smith’s goatee on-camera.\n\nA note to readers: Bold and uncensored, The Austin Chronicle has been Austin’s independent news source for over 40 years, expressing the community’s political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene.

What I learned is far more intriguing to me than any football game.\n\nPatriot Games follows an ancient symmetrical form of storytelling known as chiasmus. Its first half mirrors its second half so that it begins and ends the same way and every other point along the way to the middle of the film matches up perfectly.\n\nThis is going to be easier to digest than my analysis of the Dark Knight Trilogy or some of my other longer examples of cinematic chiasmus.\n\nSit back and learn a whole new way to appreciate Patriot Games.\n\n## The Chiasmus\n\nI’ll show you what I mean when I say that the film’s two halves mirror each other by first revealing the film’s chiasmus:\n\nA. Jack Ryan calls his house in Maryland and then makes love to his wife\n\nB. Jack kills Sean Miller’s brother during an attack on Lord Holmes and his family\n\nC. Irish Republican Army soldiers invade a renegade commander’s house and are all killed\n\nD. Jack testifies at Sean’s trial, helping to convict him\n\nE. The Ryans return to their home in Maryland\n\nF. The renegade IRA group ambushes an armored truck to rescue Sean\n\nG. Admiral Greer attempts to recruit Jack back into the CIA, but he gets rejected\n\nH. Sean obsesses over finding Jack and exacting revenge\n\nI. Lord Holmes says, “I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists”\n\nJ. Jack lectures Navy cadets on Athens’s pride leading to its downfall\n\nK. Sean and his compatriots attempt to kill Jack and his wife and daughter\n\nL. Cathy and Sally Ryan are badly injured and have to be flown to a hospital\n\nM. Jack returns to his old job at the CIA\n\nN. British authorities raid an IRA safe house\n\nN. That raid helps Jack start putting the pieces together on how to find Sean\n\nM. Sean returns to the renegade IRA group in their new camp in North Africa\n\nL. Jack drives a traumatized Cathy home from the hospital\n\nK. Sean calls Jack and threatens his family again\n\nJ. Jack threatens the IRA spokesman who is too prideful to betray his fellow Irishmen\n\nI. The renegade IRA group’s training schedule is determined by U.S. satellites\n\nH. Jack obsesses over finding Sean to protect his family\n\nG. A bookseller attempts to enlist in Sean’s mission, but he is rejected and killed\n\nF. U.S. Special Forces ambush the terrorists’ camp to try to kill Sean\n\nE. The Ryans bring their daughter home\n\nD. Jack identifies a traitor and forces a confession from him\n\nC. Renegade IRA soldiers invade the Ryans’ home and are all killed\n\nB. Jack kills Sean during an attack on Lord Holmes\n\nA. Cathy gets a call from the doctor about the sex of her unborn child\n\nNow I’ll explain each of these points in greater detail to really get into how this all works.\n\n## A. Phone Call\n\nPatriot Games begins and ends with a phone call. Jack Ryan calls his housekeeper in Maryland to ask her to get new goldfish for his daughter to replace the ones that died while he and his family were in Britain. Then he and his wife, Cathy, make love.\n\nAs a result of that lovemaking, Cathy gets pregnant and at the end she gets a phone call from the doctor letting her know that her unborn baby is healthy. He also reveals its gender, but the film fades to black before she can tell us what it is.\n\nJack tries to keep his daughter in the dark about the fate of her goldfish while the audience is left in the dark about their baby’s sex. Until the sequel, of course.\n\n## B. Assault on the Royals\n\nJack stops an assault on Lord Holmes and his family. In the process, he shoots one of the attackers who turns out to be the younger brother of one of the other attackers, Sean Miller. Sean is abandoned by the rest of the attackers and arrested. During his interrogation, one of the authorities tries to provoke Sean into giving names by saying if it had been himself who was left for dead by his friends, he would kill them.\n\nAt the film’s climax, Jack again stops an assault on Lord Holmes and Jack’s family by the same group. By this point, Sean is so angry he no longer values the lives of his fellow attackers and kills several of them while trying to get to Jack. Jack impales Sean through the chest, killing him.\n\nIn both cases, Jack prevents a disaster for the Royal Family and kills a member of the Miller family with a weapon through the chest.\n\n## C. Home Invasion\n\nSeveral IRA members storm into renegade IRA commander Kevin O’Donnell’s house in an attempt to ambush him. But he is ready for them, and he kills them all before making his escape.\n\nNear the end of the film, Kevin, Sean, and other renegade IRA members invade Jack’s house in Maryland. Jack manages to escape with his family and friends and kill several of the invaders along the way.\n\nThis is pretty clear. The house is invaded, but the home team wins both times.\n\n## D. Terrorist’s Trial\n\nJack testifies at Sean’s trial, which helps to convict him. Sean reacts angrily, yelling at Jack for killing his brother.\n\nLater, Jack discovers an IRA traitor embedded in Lord Holmes’s staff and angrily throws him down into the basement where the traitor had just come up from hiding a bodyguard he had murdered.\n\nThere’s no time for a trial the second time around, but Jack is sure of his guilt, nonetheless. Also, while Sean refuses to yield any information to his captors, the traitor starts to talk under the first bit of pressure.\n\n## E. Coming Home to a Surprise\n\nShortly after the Ryans return home to Maryland, Cathy discovers that she is pregnant.\n\nLater, Jack and Cathy bring their daughter Sally home from the hospital just in time for Jack to receive a medal of honor from Lord Holmes.\n\nBoth of these happy things resulted from Jack’s actions in London.\n\n## F. The IRA Ambush\n\nWith information provided by a traitor, Sean’s friends ambush the armored truck carrying Sean to prison in the middle of the night. They kill all of the guards, showing no mercy, even for a fellow Irishman.\n\nWith intelligence gathered by Jack, Admiral Greer orders a midnight strike on the IRA camp in North Africa where they suspect Sean is hiding out. The marines kill everyone in the camp while Jack looks on stoically.\n\nBoth men are being protected by other people fighting their battles for them. Sean actually gets his hands dirty, though, while Jack just has to endure satellite images of men clinging to life and dying.\n\n## G. Failed Recruitment\n\nAfter Sean escapes British justice, Admiral Greer visits Jack and asks him to come back to the CIA. Jack refuses and then talks to his wife who basically threatens to leave him if he ever goes back.\n\nAfter a bookseller evades British police, he goes to Sean’s camp and attempts to join his mission to kill the Royal Family. But Sean rejects his plea and kills him on the spot.\n\nJack refuses while the bookseller is refused. Cathy says she can’t live the way they used to; Sean doesn’t give the bookseller a choice and simply ends his life.\n\n## H. Obsessed with Revenge\n\nSean isn’t content with being free from his prison. He is obsessed with finding Jack and killing him because of what he did to his brother\n\nJack struggles to find enough evidence to prove where Sean is hiding. He is obsessed with finding Sean and stopping him because of what he did to his wife and daughter.\n\nSean can’t think of anything other than Jack and he is motivated purely by hatred. Jack can’t think of anything besides Sean, but he is inspired primarily by love for his family. Sean is eventually consumed by his anger while Jack is vindicated by his gut feelings.\n\n## I. Who Dictates Their Itinerary\n\nAfter Lord Holmes is told that it’s dangerous for him to engage in too many public activities, he says, “I will not have my itinerary dictated to me by terrorists.”\n\nSean and the other ex-IRA members are forced to schedule their weapons training sessions according to the movement of the satellites that fly overhead and photograph their camp.\n\nLord Holmes refuses to bow to his enemies’ pressure to change his schedule while the terrorists have to hide during certain hours while trying to lay low.\n\n## J. Pride Is Their Downfall\n\nDuring a lecture at the Naval Academy, Jack helps cadets realize that Athenians’ pride led to their downfall. Then Samuel L. Jackson (I don’t know his character’s name, and it doesn’t really matter) comes in and gives Jack a tongue-in-cheek medal for his reckless courage in the line of fire.\n\nJack goes to an Irish pub to talk to the IRA spokesman and demand information about Sean. But the spokesman is too prideful to even consider betraying a fellow Irishman. Jack promises serious retribution if he doesn’t change his mind, and Jackson suddenly appears to back Jack up.\n\nIn one case, Jack is dispensing information while in the other he is demanding it. He discusses pride being the downfall of a great civilization and he promises the downfall of the IRA in the present if the spokesman is too prideful. And Jackson interrupts both scenes at the end with his awesome presence.\n\n## K. Sean’s Threats\n\nSean sends two fellow terrorists to kill Jack while he himself brazenly attempts to kill Jack’s wife and daughter. Both attacks fail, but they leave the family bloodied.\n\nSean calls Jack at home late one night and taunts him about how easy it was to get to his family. Jack tells his wife Sean won’t be able to get that close to them again, but she still wants him dead.\n\nIn both cases, Sean is unable to inflict the deadly harm he wants on Jack and his loved ones. So he’s forced to settle for near-misses and petty threats.\n\n## L. Physical and Emotional Harm\n\nCathy and Sally Ryan are flown in a helicopter to the hospital to be treated for their serious injuries after an attempt on their lives leads to a serious car crash.\n\nAfter Cathy has recovered physically, Jack brings her back home, but she is clearly still suffering from the emotional scars of her ordeal and the threat to her family.\n\nJack is seriously shaken up as he helplessly watches his wife and daughter being treated in the hospital. Cathy is so shaken up that she has a complete change of heart about Jack returning to the CIA.\n\n## M. Back to Work\n\nInspired by the attack on his family, Jack returns to his old job at the CIA.\n\nSean returns to his extremist IRA friends at a North Africa training camp. He is frustrated to learn that Jack’s wife and daughter survived after being taken to the hospital.\n\nThe hero and villain get back to work doing what they do best. But Jack has a healthy outlet for his emotions while Sean continues to bottle his emotions up until they explode at everyone around him.\n\n## N. Putting the Pieces Together\n\nThe turning point of the film comes with a raid by British police on an apartment full of IRA members.\n\nThat event clues Jack into the fact that Sean is part of a breakoff group of the IRA that has been sabotaging other more mainstream Irish rebels from the start. All of this helps Jack figure out who they should be looking for in order to find Sean.\n\nThe attacks on the Royal Family, Ryan’s family, and other IRA members suddenly come into focus in this pivotal moment. From this point on, Jack is on the right path to finding Sean and putting an end to everything that was put into motion by Sean and his fellow extremists in the first half of the film.\n\n## What It All Means\n\nPatriot Games is about a power struggle between two men: Jack Ryan and Sean Miller. One is good and the other is evil. They’re painted in stark colors that leave nothing ambiguous about them. The symmetrical nature of this film hammers home that point.\n\nEvil has its way through most of the first half of the film while good begins to triumph in the second half.\n\nThe Hunt for Red October is still my favorite movie based on one of Tom Clancy’s novels, but now I see that Patriot Games is a much richer film than I thought.\n\nThis is the Deja Reviewer bidding you farewell until we meet again.\n\nAll images are the copyright of their owners.\n\n### Rate this:\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Tweet\n- Reddit\n\n### Related\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## About Robert Lockard, the Deja Reviewer\n\nRobert Lockard has been a lover of writing since he was very young.

I love finding these interesting patterns in films I already like a lot.\nTom Clancy was one of my favorite authors when I was growing up. My dad read and loved all of his books, so I followed in his footsteps. My favorite was The Cardinal of the Kremlin, but I doubt that will ever be made into a film.\nLikeLiked by 1 person\n\n\nReply\n- Sonatine says: .comment-author .vcard February 10, 2015 at 9:09 am .comment-meta .commentmetadata The raiders of the North African camp aren’t U.S, they’re S.A.S: Female C..I.A narrator ‘S.A.S. team on ground’Sorry to be picky!

The film Twister, produced by Warner Brothers Entertainment in 1996, was an entertainment masterpiece that attracted young minds to the idea of extreme weather.  Looking back now, how accurate was the film Twister? We took it upon ourselves to fact check the film throughout its entirety, and here is what we found:\n\nTwister fact check #1:\n\nIn the beginning of the movie, the caption says: “June, 1969”.  While the television is on in Jo’s house, the tornado warning for Oklahoma County is being broadcasted over the television.  As the family runs down the stairs on their way to the storm cellar, Jo’s father says: “The TV says it’s big. It might be an F-5.”\n\nThe Fujita Scale (F-Scale) was not introduced until 1971 by Dr. Ted Fujita and Allen Pearson, the Director of the National Severe Storms Forecasting Center Center (currently the Storm Prediction Center).  Thus, it is impossible to say what the strength of the tornado may be during that time period.\n\nScreenshot of the first scene in the Warner Bros. film Twister. Image credit: Warner Brothers Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwister fact check #2:\n\nWhile the family is outside running towards the storm cellar, the trees are blowing and branches are breaking off.  Despite the strong winds, the father’s hat remains on his head without moving and the chickens have no issues running.\n\nTwister fact check #3:\n\nThe first seen at the NSSL, it is early morning as the sun has yet to rise over Oklahoma (evident from the setting of Earth’s terminator still to the east). They mention that the cap is starting to break, and that Lifted Indices (LIs) are near -6 to -10.  Those LIs are, indeed, favorable indices for severe weather.  However, it is impossible to know exactly when the “cap” starts to erode (or break, as the script line states) prior to when convection initiates.\n\nTwister fact check #4:\n\nWhile Jo and Beltzer are working on the radar, Jo asks for a sector scan west-northwest, and to look at mid-levels of rotation and increase the PRF. The PRF (pulse repetition frequency) is the frequency at which pulses are emitted from the Doppler radar.  If the PRF is high, the Doppler radar has less time to sample precipitation and/or rain at further distances.  However, the supercell (which was real in the movie) was close to them so it is operationally correct to increase the PRF as it also increases the velocity range.\n\nTwister fact check #5:\n\nThe screenshot of this scene at the beginning of the film was a real supercell.  The crew actually had to stop filming one time (which was actually ongoing during the first VORTEX mission) due to a legitimate threat of a severe thunderstorm and tornado.\n\nScreenshot of the supercell at the beginning of the film Twister. Image credit: Warner Brothers Entertainment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwister fact check #6:\n\nIn the film, they mention an in-situ weather instrument that releases sensors into a tornado that is called Dorothy.  Dorothy was inspired by the real life TOTO.  TOTO (Totable Tornado Observatory) was an in-situ instrument developed by NOAA in attempts to measure winds inside a tornado.  Here is a picture of Dorothy, DOT-3 (later seen in the film), and the real life TOTO, seen to the right.\n\nImage of Dorothy, D.O.T. 3, and TOTO. These are located at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma. Image credit: Harrison Sincavage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwister fact check #7:\n\nWhile talking about Dorothy to the crew, they state how if they successfully deploy, they will be able to understand some of the complex dynamics involved within tornadoes and to increase warning time to 15 minutes.  In real life, this was successfully carried out for the first time in history in South Dakota in 2003.  There have been other successful deployments of in-situ instruments being very closely impacted by tornadoes that have been carried out by other field missions.\n\nTwister fact check #8:\n\nThe NSSL said that the cap was breaking and towers were going 30 miles up the dryline.  It is impossible to know when exactly the cap begins to break until storms initiate completely.  The line in the movie is slightly inaccurate.\n\nTwister fact check #9:\n\nBill mentions to Dusty that the sky is “going green.”  A green luminescence within clouds has nothing to do with an indication of a tornado; rather, it is indicative of a hail core as the sunlight that percolates through the clouds is refracted through the hailstones, giving a greenish/blueish tint to the clouds.\n\nTwister fact check #10:\n\nJonas tells Charles to do a sector scan on radar, and to keep looking for a hook.  You do not need a hook appendage (hook echo) on Doppler radar to have a mesocyclone.  Hook echoes do not always indicate a tornado, either.\n\nTwister fact check #11:\n\nThe first tornado of their storm chase is seen forming from Beltzer’s point of view.  Realistically, the formation that the movie depicts is a dynamic piping effect as the tornado descends from the mid-levels of the supercell.  Inflow air that is being sucked into the tornado constricts near the low-levels, and tightens to give a rope-like look.\n\nTwister fact check #12:\n\nThe first tornado of the day has no supercell characteristics surrounding it. No wall cloud, no inflow tail, or anything structurally correct.  It’s just a stratus cloud deck.  However, it is possible to have such high based tornadoes in real life.\n\nTwister fact check #13:\n\nThe first tornado obliterates a barn and two grain bins.  The size of a tornado in real life is not an indicator of its strength, and there have been cases of EF-4 and EF-5 tornadoes that have had a rope or stovepipe structure to it.\n\nTwister fact check #14: \\\n\nBill and Jo take cover under the bridge.  That is something that you should never do when seeking shelter from a tornado.  The tornadic winds can channel underneath an overpass and increase tremendously, and your chances of death increase as a result.\n\nTwister fact check #15:\n\nWhen Melissa, Bill’s wife, says “oh my god” while driving towards the bridge, the tractor that was on top of the bridge can be seen near the side of the road after it was thrown by the tornado.  If a tornado is violent enough, it can throw vehicles hundreds or even thousands of feet (such a case occurred on May 24th, 2011, in central Oklahoma).\n\nTwister fact check #16:\n\nJonas asks if there is an updraft shift over the radio.  There is no real visual way to tell if an updraft is changing its orientation.  Depending on the magnitude of wind shear, updrafts can have different tilts (especially with a significant increase in vertical shear).  Too much wind shear can also shear updrafts apart, leading to storm demise.\n\nTwister fact check #17:\n\nBill says: “Look at the updraft, the angle. It’s going to shift its track.” There is no way to determine where a tornado is going to turn, and looking at “updraft angles” is a fictitious statement.\n\nTwister fact check #18:\n\nLawrence says that there is an F-2, possibly F-3 tornado. There is no way to determine the strength of a tornado by looking at it.  A damage survey is to be completed to determine its strength (the EF-Scale was implemented in 2007 to refine tornado intensity with better damage indicators).\n\nTwister fact check #19:\n\nJoey mentions that the tornado looks like it’s turning.  While you can visually see a tornado turn, you can’t predict where it will turn as mentioned above.  However, there are storm environments that can favor either left or right-moving supercells, and splitting or merging supercells.\n\nTwister fact check #20:\n\nAs they near the waterspout, Bill mentions horizontal rain in associated with the waterspout.  Horizontal rain has nothing to do with a tornado.  Rain can be horizontal due to severe outflow winds that carry the raindrops at great speeds as the drops fall out of the downdraft, but it does not indicate a tornado is present.\n\nTwister fact check #21:\n\nJo says: “Bill, we’re in the core.”  If one is in the core of a supercell, it is a dangerous place to be.  Extreme rain and very large hail can fall, and the core is within close proximity to where a tornado may form within a supercell.  She also mentions that they are running into the flanking line, which is incorrect.  The flanking line is a region of cumulus and developing cumulonimbi as the clouds near the updraft of the supercell.\n\nTwister fact check #22:\n\nTheir truck is over taken by the waterspouts. Unless if it is pure luck that the tornado is weak, their vehicle would have been tossed by the waterspout/tornado.\n\nTwister fact check #23:\n\nWhile in Wakita, Oklahoma, visiting Jo’s aunt Meg, Dusty says that the television reported an F-3 tornado.  Again, there’s no way to tell a tornado’s intensity until a damage survey is conducted.\n\nTwister fact check #24:\n\nThey leave Wakita, Oklahoma, only to end up near Ames, Iowa, for the fourth tornado in the film. There is no possible way to make it that distance while driving and still have daylight given they left Wakita in the afternoon.\n\nTwister fact check #25:\n\nJoey says: “We got a touchdown!” by looking at the velocity scans on radar. There is no way to confirm a tornado by looking at the velocity data, and it was not possible to confirm tornadoes by radar until the implementation of dual-polarimetric radar that has capabilities of detecting non-meteorological objects such as debris.\n\nTwister fact check #26:\n\nWhen Beltzer says “Yeah, I got it, Billy.  This is the best motion we’ve ever seen, it’s like a piece of this fatty is over a half mile wide” there is a highway sign with the state of Texas on it.  Yet where the tornado occurs in this upcoming scene was in Iowa.\n\nTwister fact check #27:\n\nWhen the hail starts to fall as Bill and Jo near the tornado it is small, water coated hail.  While all sizes of hail occur within a supercell, the larger hailstones are found closer to the updraft to the core.  Sometimes, large hailstones can be flung out long distances from the downdraft. In regards to violent tornadoes, most cases of hail size during EF-5 rated tornadoes have been baseball size or larger.\n\nTwister fact check #28:\n\nIt is possible for tornadoes to throw all sorts of debris, including some great distances as vertical winds can get underneath debris such as vehicles (or a boat such as in the movie).\n\nTwister fact check #29:\n\nThey say that the tornado is back-building. Tornadoes do not back-build. Back-building occurs within clusters of thunderstorms as thunderstorms continue to initiate upwind of the storm (or behind it).  This is due to weak mid-level winds that can steer storms.  While they may appear stationary, the downwind cells fizzle out and the upwind storms are the most rigorous. Flash flooding is a major risk during a back building thunderstorm event.\n\nTwister fact check #30:\n\nDuring the drive-in movie theater scene, the crowd of people at the drive-in were Kansas State University broadcast students. They were casted as extras in the film.  Lawrence takes shelter in his truck, which you should never do during a tornado as it can easily loft the vehicle.\n\nTwister fact check #31:\n\nAfter the tornado, Beltzer mentions to Melissa that they experienced downdrafts and microbursts.  The downdraft is a completely separate component from the tornado; however, downdraft/outflow winds can be extremely intense and can sometimes cause extensive straightline wind damage.  A microburst is a rapid downward acceleration of air out of the downdraft, and can often lead to minor or major wind damage.\n\nTwister fact check #32:\n\nWhen they arrive in Wakita again, the damage that you see in the movie was real.  However, part of the town was intentionally destroyed by the film crew as part of the movie set.  As a cameo, Jo’s parents at the beginning of the movie are briefly seen standing within the damaged area.\n\nTwister fact check #33:\n\nDusty says to Jo that the NSSL is predicting an F-5 the next day.  That is impossible to do, no matter how intense forecast parameters are.\n\nTwister fact check #34:\n\nThey say that the tornado hit Canton, Oklahoma. This is prior to impacting Wakita. That means the tornado track length in excess of 80 miles if it were to have occurred in real life.\n\nBlank Doppler radar image of the distance between Canton and Wakita, Oklahoma. Image credit: RadarScope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwister fact check #35:\n\nA violent tornado (EF-4+ strength) can pick up a house off of its foundation and destroy it (there is video evidence of this).  This is seen in the film during the last tornado scene, as the house drops right into the road in front of Bill and Jo.  Though, the likelihood of a house being near perfectly in tact after being picked up by a tornado is near 0%.\n\nTwister fact check #36:\n\nTornadoes can completely destroy radio towers (and power lines). This occurred in real life on May 22nd, 2010, near Bowdle, South Dakota, by an EF-4 tornado.\n\nTwister fact check #37:\n\nBill and Jo strap themselves to pipes that go down “at least 30 feet”, according to Bill’s line. The chances of surviving a direct impact of an F/EF-5 rated tornado with winds greater than 200mph is extremely low.  If the wind does not kill you, any flying debris that impacts you will as the force is the velocity cubed.  If 2×4 pieces of wood, metal, or a vehicle is traveling over 200mph, then that is a tremendous force involved.  The fatality rate for F/EF-5 rated tornadoes has been statistically high.\n\nFinal Twister fact #38:\n\nThe house at the end of the movie was a real house that was actually damaged by a tornado, and it was intact after impact in real life.\n\nQuestions or comments about this summary?  Contact us here!\n\nJoin the tornado history discussion on our Discord Server!\n\nNote:  There are some images/videos in our summaries that were licensed to us to be used only on this website.

Scary creatures and life-threatening situations are frequent. The film, however, is as clever as it is exaggerated; some of the most destructive violence is implied, happening just off-camera. Still, young or sensitive kids who can't readily distinguish fantasy from reality may be disturbed by the barrage of exploding insects, grotesque morphing from human to alien life form, and cartoon violence (characters blow up, are vaporized, stabbed, shot with ray guns, and more). There's plenty of swearing (\"damn,\" \"goddamn,\" \"bastard,\" \"hell,\" \"s--t\") and a few insults, including \"d--k\" and \"pr--k\").\nTo stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails\n.\n- Violence &amp;amp; Scariness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        a lot\n      \n\nAll cartoon, all the time. Nothing is meant to be taken seriously, but rather to shock and awe the viewer with comic horror and laughter. Heads roll (literally), and there are explosions, crashes, stabbings, shootings, futuristic weapons. The \"ewww\" factor is high, as insects with massive tentacles capture humans; slimy creatures erupt into blue goo; a giant bug swallows one of the leads and spits him up later; a woman gives birth to a squid; a vacuum-hose is forced down a man's throat; bizarre-looking humans morph into all manner of even more bizarre creatures.\n\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content?\n        Adjust limits for Violence &amp;amp; Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.      \nGet started\nClose\n- Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        some\n      \n\nFrequent swearing and mild profanity: \"goddamn,\" \"s--t,\" \"ass,\" \"bastard,\" hell,\" \"butt,\" \"pissed off.\"  \"D--k\" and \"pr--k\" are used as insults.\n\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content?\n        Adjust limits for Language in your kid's entertainment guide.      \nGet started\nClose\n- Products &amp;amp; Purchases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        very little\n      \n\nMarlboro cigarettes, Gold's Gym, Bloomingdale's, Ford.\n- Drinking, Drugs &amp;amp; Smoking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        very little\n      \n\nA running joke shows a species of small, slimy, highly literate insects as heavy smokers.\n\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content?\n        Adjust limits for Drinking, Drugs &amp;amp; Smoking in your kid's entertainment guide.      \nGet started\nClose\n- Sex, Romance &amp;amp; Nudity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        none\n      \n\nSome mild innuendo and flirting between one of the heroes and the very attractive (and sexy) female coroner.\n\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content?\n        Adjust limits for Sex, Romance &amp;amp; Nudity in your kid's entertainment guide.      \nGet started\nClose\n- Positive Role Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        a lot\n      \n\nThe heroes are flawless -- good, brave, highly intelligent, loyal, and strong.

I say 10 +\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFirst of all I would like to say that I'm happy websites like Common Sense Media exist, it really makes finding a suitable movie easier and more bearable. The age rating for this movie is useful when it comes to violence, swearing and scariness but I would still like to add one thing: the rating says there is only sexual innuendo, however there are multiple scenes where a woman is stuck in a tree and her skirt keeps hanging behind a branch, this results in her skirt and stockings ripping and we see her bare thigh/part of her buttock. Later on she falls from the tree with her legs wide open and we see her underwear for a brief moment. In my opinion both these scenes and the innuendo were unnecessary and didnt make sense (innuendo takes place at a mortuary during a conversation about dead body).\n\n## What's the Story?\n\nThe central premise of MEN IN BLACK is that aliens have been living among us for years, monitored and controlled by a secret government agency that must keep the human population unaware. New recruit Agent J (Will Smith) joins up and learns the ropes from veteran Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), just in time to save the world from a brand-new threat.\n\n## Is It Any Good?\n\nPart comedy, part science-fiction parody, and part action film, the movie just keeps throwing elements into the pot. What's so original about Men in Black is its unpredictable tone. Teens will love the combination of irreverent humor, great chase sequences, and gross-out special effects.\n\nMany kids particularly enjoy the over-the-top alien bad guys as they saunter around the countryside wreaking mayhem. But they'll save their heartiest laughs for Smith and his boyish charm. Of course, Smith's flippancy wouldn't play without Jones' earnest straight-man act. The movie is packed with fun moments: alien eyelids blinking sideways (you've got to see it), a talking pug, and supermarket tabloids proven correct. Everything you've ever read in the Star about aliens is true!\n\n## Talk to Your Kids About ...\n\n- Families can talk about Men in Black's over-the-top weapons and violence. Does any of it seem real? Why or why not? Does the impact of movie violence change based on how realistic it is?\n- Talk about aliens. Do you think that there are other intelligent creatures out there?\n- Can you see why Men in Black spawned sequels including Men in Black II and Men in Black III?\n- How do the characters demonstrate teamwork? Why is that an important character strength?\n\n## Movie Details\n\n- In theaters\n        :\n        \n                    \n    July 2, 1997\n- On DVD or streaming\n        :\n        \n                    \n    May 21, 2002\n- Cast\n        :\n        \nLinda Fiorentino\n, \n  \n\n                        Tommy Lee Jones\n, \n  \n\n                        Vincent D'Onofrio\n, \n  \n\n                        Will Smith\n- Director\n        :\n        \nBarry Sonnenfeld\n- Inclusion Information\n        :\n        \n                    \n    Black actors\n- Studio\n        :\n        \nColumbia Tristar\n- Genre\n        :\n        \nScience Fiction\n- Topics\n        :\n        \nSpace and Aliens\n- Character Strengths\n        :\n        \nTeamwork\n- Run time\n        :\n        \n                    \n    113 minutes\n- MPAA rating\n        :\n        \n                    \n    PG-13\n- MPAA explanation\n        :\n        \n                    \n    language and sci-fi violence\n- Last updated\n        :\n        \n                    \n    February 7, 2025\n\n## Did we miss something on diversity?\n\nResearch shows a connection between kids' healthy self-esteem and positive portrayals in media.

I enjoyed the movie and it left me wanting more.\n\nI've seen comparisons to Diehard, and while this is no die hard, it is certainly a watchable movie.\n\nThe main character is likable and you get drawn into his story. While it is not a complex movie and is easy to follow, sometimes you just want escapism. I would like to see a follow up with the same main characters.\n\nI think seeing the main character carrying out his duties as a police officer with the young family would make a really good movie.\n\n- lovingccccb\n- Dec 26, 2024\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ16\n\n- How long is Carry-On?Powered by Alexa\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - December 13, 2024 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - Hành Lý Xách Tay\n- Filming locations\n    - New Orleans, Louisiana, USA(As Los Angeles)\n- Production companies\n    - Amblin Partners\n    - Cobalt Blue 1802\n    - Dreamworks Pictures\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 59 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Atmos\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 2.00 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop Gap\n\nWhat is the Canadian French language plot outline for Carry-On (2024)?\n\n- See more gaps\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.\n\nThat's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.\n\n\nOthers in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic. \n\nThe proof is in the pudding--they must have done something right!!\n\n- Doylenf\n- May 17, 2001\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ18\n\n- Did anybody discover that Harry Lyme was disguised as a Police officer?\n- Behind Kevin's mom in the Airport, is that Elvis Presley as an extra?\n- Why is it that Kevin orders a pizza and scares away the pizza guy by playing that gangster movie and fast forwards the videotape to where the gangster is shooting the other gangster but when Marv approached the door alone Kevin does the same thing only with a pot full of firecrackers as the tape is still playing?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - December 13, 1990 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Facebook\n    - Official Hotstar\n- Languages\n    - English\n    - French\n- Also known as\n    - Mi pobre angelito\n- Filming locations\n    - 671 Lincoln Avenue, Winnetka, Illinois, USA(McCallister home)\n- Production companies\n    - Twentieth Century Fox\n    - Hughes Entertainment\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Box office\n\n- Budget\n    - $18,000,000 (estimated)\n- Gross US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $285,761,243\n- Opening weekend US &amp;amp; Canada\n    - $17,081,997\n    - Nov 18, 1990\n- Gross worldwide\n    - $476,684,675\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime1 hour 43 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Stereo\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

                "Commentary": "The world's biggest online community about The Matrix franchise, created by the visionary minds of Lana and Lilly Wachowski! A question inspired by the actor Bernard White (who played Sati’s father in M2 and M3) and in the more recent past blogged this rant in defence of the third movie: “I was able to do this the second time I saw THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS. I have now seen it an additional 5 times. Making it an even 7. The movie is nothing, I mean nothing, short of brilliant. The depth and complexity is well worth the closer look, that, it seems to me, some of these critics were not willing to take. It seemed to me that they did not want to risk falling in love with this film. Why? I believe it has to do with betrayal. Not wanting to be betrayed, not wanting to buy into the overdone hype of the Warner Brothers Publicity Machine. Not wanting to reward this quiet underground discovery of theirs turned Hollywood Blockbuster. They will, of course, site things like “wooden performances” and “clunky dialogue”. An “uneven and confusing storytelling” that they feel amounts to a kind of sound and fury signifying nothing. I will not stop short of saying that with this movie as the culmination of this trilogy, we have seen the deepest and most complex original modern mythology to ever be put on film."
