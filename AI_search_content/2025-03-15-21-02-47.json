Noir films often explore moral ambiguity and psychological depth, indicating that the user likely appreciates narratives that delve into the human psyche and present characters with intricate motivations. This appreciation for complexity may reflect a personality that values depth in both entertainment and personal interactions, seeking out experiences that are not superficial.\n\n3. **Interest in Dark Themes:**  \n   The choice of \"Brick\" and the mention of noir style imply that the user is comfortable with darker themes and narratives that explore the more sinister aspects of life.

The movie doesn't have a satisfying twist -if it can be called a twist anyway- and has pacing problems. I did like Kate Winslet's performance and some of the directed scenes, but all in all did not enjoy.

Everything about the movie is great: the atmosphere, the acting, the direction.

The abysmal plot twist this movie is holding 1h and 30min to show will likely make you feel betrayed and annoyed for wasting your time. Extremely slow paced.

Does the good doctor know more than he's letting on?DirectorGuillaume CanetStarsFrançois CluzetMarie-Josée CrozeAndré DussollierMy main issue with this movie is the sluggish build up. It's constantly throwing information to the viewer, building the mystery and introducing new characters. Frankly I was at a loss at some of the characters relationship to the protagonist, as the movie doesn't bother to explain until way later. The movie proceeds to solve its mystery and all of the plot points in one scene. The twist here is good, as is the movie's quality in general, but all in all I was not impressed.\n\nPlot Twist: \"Good\"\nFinal Verdict: \"Semi-Recommended\"\n- 21.

Ok so the mystery in this movie is compelling and the plot unravels well. There's also decent acting and direction in certain scenes. But the ending is... not so good. The movie does not bother to explain much and leaves the plot open to interpretation. The final scene which plays along with the credits hides the allegedly plot twist and is very easy to miss. It wasn't an acceptable twist for me either. \n\nPlot Twist: \"Obscure\"\nFinal Verdict: \"Semi-Recommended\"\n- 22.

There is no mystery here but the presentation and direction of the scenes is mesmerising.

The movie is not something special in acting or direction but it conveys its theme well and suprisingly manages to not leave any plot holes. There are some last minute twists but they are not the movie's purpose. The ending is satisfying though.

It's a gripping mystery with a solid unraveling. Amazing acting by Melissa George. The plot is really really good. It comes off as your average slasher horror at first but then the movie takes a turn. And then you know there is something special going on here. The movie's theme is not directly explained but left vague for the viewer to understand through visual and dialogue hints. May require a second viewing to fully grasp. Amazing plot twist and ending. Greatly underappreciated movie.\n\nPlot Twist: \"Amazing\"\nFinal Verdict: \"Top Recommendation\"\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

While film noir experienced something of a decline from the 1960s onwards, it has undergone a powerful resurgence with a spate of neo-noir films being released in recent years, many of which have refreshed the genre while taking it to interesting new heights.\n\nStaying in vogue with the striking imagery, hard-boiled and gritty narratives, and the complicated characters that saw film noir become such an acclaimed genre, these neo-noir hits offer compelling viewing experiences. Unafraid of mixing genres, these films - many of which are by some of the most illustrious filmmakers currently working - have excelled as critical darlings and fan favorites, and appear certain to become modern classics in their own right as time goes on.\n\n## 12 \n\n                            'Brick' (2005)\n\n### Directed by Rian Johnson\n\nImage via Focus Features\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRian Johnson's directorial debut, Brick marked a bold and authoritative introduction to feature films by the acclaimed filmmaker which also served as his first of many collaborations with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The mystery picture sees Gordon-Levitt star as Brendan Frye, a high school student who receives a frantic phone call from his ex-girlfriend before she winds up murdered, prompting Brendan to look into the killing and come face to face with some of the nastiest figures in his school in the process.\n\nThe meshing of crime noir and teenage drama is dubious in theory, but Brick nails its obtuse mixing of tones and styles with aplomb thanks to an exceptional, witty screenplay from Johnson and an assured lead performance from Gordon-Levitt. While abundant and overwhelming, its overt homages to classic noir never diminish the charm of the film which is sure to only grow in stature as the neo-noir subgenre continues to evolve and gain new fans as well.\n\nRent on Amazon\n\n## 11 \n\n                            'Sin City' (2005)\n\n### Directed by Frank Miller &amp; Robert Rodriguez\n\nImage via Miramax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMade famous for its violence and its sense of style which included blending black and white imagery with flashes of color, Sin City was an instant cult classic because of its striking nature. Following three storylines which take place amid the criminal corruption of Basin City, it tracks a musclebound vigilante out for revenge, a rogue cop battling against a child-killer, and an ex-prostitute who works with her new boyfriend - a private investigator - to evade her aggressive former pimp.\n\nBased on Frank Miller's graphic novel series of the same name, which Miller himself adapted to the screen along with Robert Rodriguez, Sin City became an enticing classic with its arresting visual aesthetic, its tales of ultra-violence and human depravity, and its immaculate ensemble cast. It broke new ground in terms of what could be done in mainstream film, and juggled its interweaving plot threads with great poise.\n\n##### Sin City\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Rosario Dawson\n- Bruce Willis\n- Jessica Alba\n- Elijah Wood\n\n######\n\nRent on Apple TV\n\n## 10 \n\n                            'Nocturnal Animals' (2016)\n\n### Directed by Tom Ford\n\nImage via Focus Features\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA stunningly decadent yet underrated psychological thriller film with a disturbing story of love and revenge, Nocturnal Animals is, at times, a difficult viewing experience but an enthralling one nonetheless. It stars Amy Adams as Susan Morrow, the owner of an upscale art gallery overseeing a confronting new exhibition who is shaken when she receives a novel manuscript from her ex-husband which details a vacationing family being attacked in disturbing fashion.\n\nThe second, and, to date, most recent film by Tom Ford, Nocturnal Animals sees the director lean heavily into his fashion design skillset to present a visually arresting adaptation of Austin Wright’s novel Tony and Susan. With its entrancing atmosphere mixing with its violent sensitivities hypnotically, Nocturnal Animals is a beautifully distressing picture that will be revered as a triumph in style and tone in years to come. – Ryan Heffernan\n\n##### Nocturnal Animals\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Aaron Taylor-Johnson\n- Ellie Bamber\n- Laura Linney\n- Armie Hammer\n\n######\n\nRent on Apple TV\n\n## 9 \n\n                            'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' (2005)\n\n### Directed by Shane Black\n\nImage via Warner Bros. Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen it comes to mixing the moral levity of noir cinema with a riveting sense of fun and chaos, there are few in the business better than Shane Black. Serving as his directorial debut after having spent years in the industry, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was able to have its cake and eat it too as a ridiculously entertaining crime comedy that produced a genuinely engrossing mystery story as well.\n\nCoasting on the brilliant chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer, it follows a petty thief from New York who is sent to Los Angeles to train under a private eye for a movie role when he is mistaken for an actor, only for the feuding duo to become embroiled in a mysterious murder case alongside a struggling actress. An instant cult classic, the film's legacy has continued to grow with the expansion of the genre and the evolution of Downey Jr.'s career, with his outing as Harry Lockhart still one of his most divine performances thus far.\n\n##### Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\n\nRent on Apple TV\n\n## 8 \n\n                            'Blade Runner 2049' (2017)\n\n### Directed by Denis Villeneuve\n\nImage via Warner Bros. Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is so widely regarded as an underrated cult classic that it is practically on the brink of becoming a bona fide sci-fi classic in its own right, and rightfully so. A well-made legacy sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 classic Blade Runner, it follows K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant blade runner who uncovers a dangerous secret concerning not only the fate of humanity and the androids, but his own destiny as well, and journeys to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who has been missing for more than 30 years.\n\nSurpassing the original film in several key aspects, Blade Runner 2049 was a rare achievement in filmmaking, with Denis Villeneuve conjuring up an enchanting viewing experience defined by its breathtaking visuals, its immersive atmosphere, and its measured pacing of an intricate and complex story. Despite the fact that it flopped at the box office, the film has become a revered modern gem that reinforced the original film's themes of identity and humanity while exploring those core issues from an intriguing new angle.\n\n##### Blade Runner 2049\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Ryan Gosling\n- Harrison Ford\n- Jared Leto\n- Ana De Armas\n\n######\n\nRent on Apple TV\n\n## 7 \n\n                            'Nightmare Alley' (2021)\n\n### Directed by Guillermo del Toro\n\nImage via Searchlight Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on what had become a forgotten gem of 40s cinema and classic noir, Guillermo del Toro beautifully reinvigorated the dazzling and disturbing story of Nightmare Alley for new audiences, breathing new life into the carnival crime flick with an eerie and stylistic punch. The film follows Stanton Carlisle (Bradley Cooper), an ambitious carnie who uses his expertise in psychic practices and showmanship to swindle social elites, but his scheme soon grows dangerous when he becomes involved with a psychiatrist and plots his most ambitious take yet.\n\nBenefitting from del Toro's unique style, Nightmare Alley is a cruel and relentless look into ambition and desperation, heightened by a stellar cast led by a devastating Cooper. Gleefully wicked, Nightmare Alley might be a tough watch, but its deft handling of thorny subjects and lush production values make it a modern noir with a bite as strong as its powerful bark.\n\n##### Nightmare Alley\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Clifton Collins Jr.\n- Toni Collette\n- Romina Power\n- Bradley Cooper\n\n######\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\n## 6 \n\n                            'Gone Baby Gone' (2007)\n\n### Directed by Ben Affleck\n\nImage via Miramax Films\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA scintillating and effectively disturbing directorial debut from Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone saw the actor-turned-director make an immediate impression with his film-making with an engrossing crime mystery defined by its powerful performances and its depiction of working-class Boston. It follows Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) as they investigate the disappearance of a four-year-old girl in Dorchester.\n\nGone Baby Gone exhibits a bleak and dismal, though undeniably enthralling atmosphere as Kenzie and Gennaro's investigation sees them confront all manner of local criminals, ranging from drug dealers and gangsters to pedophiles. Treading a strained morality, Gone Baby Gone succeeds in being a provocative and subversive thriller, sidestepping genre conventions with deft brilliance to be one of the most impactful and complex neo-noir films in recent memory.\n\n##### Gone Baby Gone\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Casey Affleck\n- Michelle Monaghan\n- Morgan Freeman\n- Ed Harris\n\nGone Baby Gone is a crime drama centering on a detective investigating the disappearance a little girl.

The mystery crime thriller focuses on the abduction of two young girls, with one of the children’s fathers going to extreme lengths to find answers while the detective investigating the case struggles to make inroads.\n\nEmotionally complex and loaded with dread, Prisoners has an engrossing intensity which saw the film excel as both a fascinating look at desperate characters as well as a harrowing and disturbing viewing experience. With Hugh Jackman putting in a career-best performance while Jake Gyllenhaal was equally magnetic in the co-starring role, the film is gradually coming to be revered as a modern neo-noir classic and an underrated highlight of Villeneuve’s career. – Ryan Heffernan\n\n##### Prisoners\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Hugh Jackman\n- Jake Gyllenhaal\n- Viola Davis\n- Maria Bello\n\n######\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n## 4 \n\n                            'Nightcrawler' (2014)\n\n### Directed by Dan Gilroy\n\nImage via Open Road Films\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRunning as a shockingly callous though utterly captivating thriller, Nightcrawler is a relentless character study that delves into the mind of a sociopath to be one of the most brilliant and unique neo-noir films ever made. It follows Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a troubled and unattached stranger who spends his nights pursuing violent crimes and deadly accidents across Los Angeles with a camera to sell the footage to a local news station.\n\nWhile director Dan Gilroy succeeds in striking a gritty and uncomfortable tone from the film's opening moments, it is Gyllenhaal who deserves full credit for an unforgettable career-best performance that has the capacity to genuinely rattle viewers. Completely unapologetic, Nightcrawler is a cynical and brutal depiction of the amorality of journalism, posing intriguing and hard-hitting questions that cement a long-lasting legacy as a ruthless exploration of unethical behavior in American capitalism.\n\n##### Nightcrawler\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Riz Ahmed\n- Bill Paxton\n- Jake Gyllenhaal\n- Rene Russo\n\n######\n\nWatch on Starz\n\n## 3 \n\n                            'The Nice Guys' (2016)\n\n### Directed by Shane Black\n\nImage via Warner Bros. Pictures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother blending of neo-noir narrative with a dash of comedic brilliance from director Shane Black, The Nice Guys is a true modern comedy classic that functions as a buddy cop film and thrives on the back of the chemistry between stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. The duo star as a shady P.I. and a hired thug respectively, with the two having to work together to look into a young woman's disappearance as the mystery surrounding a dead porn star overshadows their investigation.\n\nAbsurdly entertaining and endlessly rewatchable, The Nice Guys was a triumphant achievement in its ability to blend the best elements of neo-noir mystery with sensational comedy dialogue. Its financial failure upon release was a damning shock not only for the film but for lovers of the genre, with hopes for a sequel unfulfilled even though it is widely viewed to be one of the best neo-noir films this century.\n\n##### The Nice Guys\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Ryan Gosling\n- Ty Simpkins\n- Rachele Brooke Smith\n- Russell Crowe\n\n######\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n## 2 \n\n                            'Drive' (2011)\n\n### Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn\n\nImage via FilmDistrict\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt would be easy to make a case for Ryan Gosling being the undisputed king of neo-noir cinema, with the actor excelling in both comedic takes on the genre and more violent iterations of it as well. Drive may just be the best film of his career thus far, with Gosling starring as an unnamed stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals, only to find himself being drawn deeper into the underworld than he would like when he forms a bond with his neighbor and agrees to help her husband pay off a debt when he is released from prison.\n\nWith Nicolas Winding Refn directing the film, the neo-noir thriller is imbued with a mesmerizing sense of style born from its neon lighting, minimalist dialogue, and its retro, electronic soundtrack. Punctuated with occasional though confronting outbursts of stylized ultra-violence, Drive has become one of the most iconic films of the neo-noir genre released this century.\n\n##### Drive\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Ryan Gosling\n- Albert Brooks\n- Bryan Cranston\n- Carey Mulligan\n\n######\n\nRent on Amazon\n\n## 1 \n\n                            'Widows' (2018)\n\n### Directed by Steve McQueen\n\nImage via 20th Century Fox\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn outstanding though underrated follow-up from his Oscar-winning picture 12 Years a Slave, the 2018 crime-thriller Widows saw Steve McQueen in fine form once more. The neo-noir drama focuses on four women, left as widows when their husbands are killed while working a heist, who band together to carry out a job of their own in order to pay off a debt to a powerful crime boss and find some semblance of financial freedom.\n\nLed by an assured Viola Davis, Widows is a confident, powerful, and thought-provoking film which takes audiences on a non-stop thrill ride rife with gripping action sequences and stunning plot twists. With Elizabeth Debicki, Michelle Rodriguez, and Cynthia Erivo co-starring, as well as an amazing supporting cast, Widows boasts a spectacular cast to deliver an enthralling crime story with astute direction from McQueen operating at his very best.\n\n##### Widows\n\nR\n\n### Cast\n\n- Daniel Kaluuya\n- Brian Tyree Henry\n- Liam Neeson\n- Cynthia Erivo\n\n######\n\nWatch on Fubo\n\nNEXT:The Best Noir Comedies Of The 21st Century, Ranked\n\n- Movie\n\nRecommended\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### Is ‘Borderline’ Streaming?

I mean, becoming deeply embroiled in a mystery, Loki viewed things that were so much deeper than they appeared. Also, dark themes all around about the depravity of people, both good and bad. It seems that the theme of morality is also a big part. That being said, there really is not a lot online that suggests it is. So, reddit, what are your thoughts? Is it really a neo-noir?"

            "Dark Themes": "The film opens with Jake Gyllenhaal’s Louis ‘Lou’ Bloom breaking into a yard and stealing a load of copper wiring. This early scene is foundational for both the character and the film’s setting: It establishes Bloom not only as a man who is unconstrained by conventional morality but also as someone who has successfully internalised the principles and rhetorics of neoliberalism.",
            "Unique Storytelling": "Nightcrawler is filled with the neon-drenched streets that made Drive look beautiful and yet many of the film’s images come across as monstrous and malformed. Nightcrawler openly mocks the beauty of films like Drive and dwells on the vicious cynicism that lies at the heart of cinematic style as well as our relationship with it.",

                "description": "The film follows Bloom as he becomes a freelance cameraman, capturing crime scenes and accidents for local news. His journey is marked by a ruthless ambition and a complete disregard for morality, showcasing the darker side of capitalism and media sensationalism. The character of Bloom is portrayed as a plucky outsider who embodies the Capitalist work ethic, yet his actions reveal a profound moral emptiness. The film critiques not only the local news industry but also the audience's complicity in seeking out sensationalist content.",

            "Plot Complexity": "Mike Carr and Johnny Dixon are roommates. After many months Mike returns to his old neighborhood and goes into Tim McGinnis’ bar to wait for Estelle Mitchell, a woman he hasn't seen since soon after her twin sister Linda was murdered. He sits down and starts having flashbacks of the events around Linda's death. Johnny had been dating Estelle until he discovered that she was seeing other men. He dumped her and began a relationship with her sweet twin, Linda. Due to a head injury he had suffered during the war, Johnny experienced regular nervous breakdowns. He and Mike served in the army together and, being roommates, Mike nursed him through these. Johnny and Linda were very much in love, but Estelle wanted him back and was determined to break up the happy couple. In the meantime, she was seeing Mike, who had a hard time resisting her vampy style. But the twins both wanted Johnny, and one night they got into a fight over him, after which Linda went to see Johnny. Estelle tried to intercept and get to Johnny's first. Mike sees Estelle arrive before Linda and stops her from coming between the two lovers. However, when Mike returns to his apartment alone a couple of hours later, Estelle telephones Mike from her home and at her mother's request, to say that Linda never came home and has been reported missing. Mike finds Johnny, drunk and distraught. He begs Mike to verify his alibi - that Linda had left his and Mike's place after an argument with Johnny, and that he heard Linda whistle for, and then saw her get into, a taxi. When the police arrive at the scene they find a buckle from Linda's trench-coat on Johnny's apartment floor and, after finding Linda's body in the apartment building, they take Johnny in for questioning. Searching for clues in the men's room of McGinnis' bar, Mike finds another buckle outside its window. He goes to Johnny and suggests the possibility that Johnny's memory might have failed him the night of the murder. While they are talking, the police arrive to arrest Johnny and he panics. Mike helps his friend by letting him escape out the back. In order to persuade Mike to give Johnny up, Detective Heller takes Mike to the morgue to show him Linda's body. Heller then recounts the horrible details of Linda's death: After being choked, Linda was pushed, still alive, into the chute of the trash incinerator, and when he was unable to fit her in the tight space, the murderer shoved her in and broke her neck. The murderer then pulled her out and put her in a barrel on the roof. Mike is disgusted by this, but still doesn't believe his friend murdered Linda. After disarming Johnny (who bought had bought a revolver with money Mike had given him to get by on while in hiding) he convinces him to come forward and clear his name. As they arrive home, Estelle is waiting for them with an older, possessive man named Alex Tremholt, who has been renting a room at the Mitchells' since the twins were young. While they are there, Mike hears a woman whistle for a taxi, and realizes it must be the same one Johnny heard the night of the murder. Mike gives Tremholt the revolver and leaves to check on the whistler. When Tremholt insists on calling the police to arrest Johnny, he manages to escape once more. Detective Heller arrives and suspects Tremholt of having a long-standing, unrequited love for Estelle and of killing the innocent Linda, whom he mistook for Estelle, the object of his desire. With the truth being revealed, Mike hurries off to tell Johnny he is in the clear and cuts him down after nearly hanging himself. Back in the present, Estelle shows up at McGinnis' and Mike drags her to his old apartment and insinuates that she committed the murder. When he enters the flat, however, Heller is waiting to arrest him. The detective reveals that Jake, the apartment janitor, recently found Linda's necklace in the incinerator chute with Mike's fingerprints all over it. It turns out that Mike killed Linda, believing she was Estelle. After telling Mike that he only held Tremholt to fool Mike he was in the clear, Heller accompanies him down the stairs and past Estelle into the night.",

Nightcrawler openly mocks the beauty of films like Drive and dwells on the vicious cynicism that lies at the heart of cinematic style as well as our relationship with it.",

His journey is marked by a ruthless ambition and a complete disregard for morality, showcasing the darker side of capitalism and media sensationalism. The character of Bloom is portrayed as a plucky outsider who embodies the Capitalist work ethic, yet his actions reveal a profound moral emptiness. The film critiques not only the local news industry but also the audience's complicity in seeking out sensationalist content.",

            "Plot Complexity": "Mike Carr and Johnny Dixon are roommates. After many months Mike returns to his old neighborhood and goes into Tim McGinnis’ bar to wait for Estelle Mitchell, a woman he hasn't seen since soon after her twin sister Linda was murdered. He sits down and starts having flashbacks of the events around Linda's death. Johnny had been dating Estelle until he discovered that she was seeing other men. He dumped her and began a relationship with her sweet twin, Linda. Due to a head injury he had suffered during the war, Johnny experienced regular nervous breakdowns. He and Mike served in the army together and, being roommates, Mike nursed him through these. Johnny and Linda were very much in love, but Estelle wanted him back and was determined to break up the happy couple. In the meantime, she was seeing Mike, who had a hard time resisting her vampy style. But the twins both wanted Johnny, and one night they got into a fight over him, after which Linda went to see Johnny. Estelle tried to intercept and get to Johnny's first. Mike sees Estelle arrive before Linda and stops her from coming between the two lovers. However, when Mike returns to his apartment alone a couple of hours later, Estelle telephones Mike from her home and at her mother's request, to say that Linda never came home and has been reported missing. Mike finds Johnny, drunk and distraught. He begs Mike to verify his alibi - that Linda had left his and Mike's place after an argument with Johnny, and that he heard Linda whistle for, and then saw her get into, a taxi. When the police arrive at the scene they find a buckle from Linda's trench-coat on Johnny's apartment floor and, after finding Linda's body in the apartment building, they take Johnny in for questioning. Searching for clues in the men's room of McGinnis' bar, Mike finds another buckle outside its window. He goes to Johnny and suggests the possibility that Johnny's memory might have failed him the night of the murder. While they are talking, the police arrive to arrest Johnny and he panics. Mike helps his friend by letting him escape out the back. In order to persuade Mike to give Johnny up, Detective Heller takes Mike to the morgue to show him Linda's body. Heller then recounts the horrible details of Linda's death: After being choked, Linda was pushed, still alive, into the chute of the trash incinerator, and when he was unable to fit her in the tight space, the murderer shoved her in and broke her neck. The murderer then pulled her out and put her in a barrel on the roof. Mike is disgusted by this, but still doesn't believe his friend murdered Linda. After disarming Johnny (who bought had bought a revolver with money Mike had given him to get by on while in hiding) he convinces him to come forward and clear his name. As they arrive home, Estelle is waiting for them with an older, possessive man named Alex Tremholt, who has been renting a room at the Mitchells' since the twins were young. While they are there, Mike hears a woman whistle for a taxi, and realizes it must be the same one Johnny heard the night of the murder. Mike gives Tremholt the revolver and leaves to check on the whistler. When Tremholt insists on calling the police to arrest Johnny, he manages to escape once more. Detective Heller arrives and suspects Tremholt of having a long-standing, unrequited love for Estelle and of killing the innocent Linda, whom he mistook for Estelle, the object of his desire. With the truth being revealed, Mike hurries off to tell Johnny he is in the clear and cuts him down after nearly hanging himself. Back in the present, Estelle shows up at McGinnis' and Mike drags her to his old apartment and insinuates that she committed the murder. When he enters the flat, however, Heller is waiting to arrest him. The detective reveals that Jake, the apartment janitor, recently found Linda's necklace in the incinerator chute with Mike's fingerprints all over it. It turns out that Mike killed Linda, believing she was Estelle. After telling Mike that he only held Tremholt to fool Mike he was in the clear, Heller accompanies him down the stairs and past Estelle into the night.",
