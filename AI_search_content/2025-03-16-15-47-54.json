This suggests that the user values intellectual engagement and enjoys exploring complex themes, which is a hallmark of an intellectually curious personality.\n\n2. **Appreciation for Complexity:**  \n   The selection of films listed—such as \"Oldeuboi\" (Oldboy) and \"Chugyeogja\" (The Chaser)—highlights a strong appreciation for intricate plots and multifaceted characters. These films often involve moral ambiguity and psychological intricacies, suggesting that the user is drawn to narratives that require active engagement and critical thinking, reflecting a personality that thrives on complexity rather than simplicity.\n\n3. **Preference for Psychological Depth:**  \n   The user's enjoyment of thrillers with psychological elements, as indicated by their reference to \"Shutter Island,\" points to a fascination with the human psyche and emotional depth.

Slow burner but great climax!\n\nWow! I caught wind of this through a magazine review and checked it out and was very glad I did. Some of the great stuff coming out of South Korea will blow your mind and this is no exception. The references people made to this movie being in the caliber of Oldboy and Memories of Murder are well substantiated but I would liken it more to Memories of Murder and not quite in the same league as Oldboy. The only movie in league with Oldboy is Seven. While the plot kind of reminded me of some of the classic 80s and 90s psycho-killer thrillers we have had come out of the US, it does hold up well on its own for being a foreign film. Not the most original plot but a decent twist on it nonetheless. Nothing in the plot or sequence of events stood out as unbelievable and there are some real gripping scenes that'll make you white-knuckle. There are some good character developments and reversals that I enjoyed as we see our main character, a former cop turned pimp, trying to find the guy who's been killing his girls and coming to grips with his personal responsibilities and justice. I don't want to give away the plot other than that as it would detract from your enjoyment. It does burn a little slow after the first 20 minutes of the movie as we see events unfold so be prepared for the reward in the last 30 minutes of the movie as the sequence of events crescendo.

The U.S. has had plenty of successful adaptations, ranging from horror flicks like The Grudge (Ju-On) and The Ring (Ringu) to dramas like Jane the Virgin (Juana la Virgen) and The Good Doctor (The Good Doctor). However, plenty of American original shows that have been popularized have been adapted to fit other cultural mediums.\n\nSome such countries include South Korea, which, while known for its K-drama-esque style of writing, has adapted some television and film from the U.S., incorporating its own political values and commentary that does not stray too far away from the source material. This makes for interesting takes and views through the lens of a different culture, creating an interesting conversation about the success of adaptations and what elements make a film or TV show unique to its home country. Here's to popular remakes of American TV shows and films that South Korea successfully remade into their own medium.\n\n## 10 \n\n                            'Marrying a Millionaire' (2005-2006)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Joe Millionaire' (2003)\n\nMarrying a Millionaire follows Eun-young (Kim Hyun-joo) as she is invited to be a participant in a reality show called Marrying a Millionaire, which is about an average Joe kind of guy who can pull off acting and looking like a wealthy man. This man is Young-hoon (Go Soo), who is a hardworking citizen and is his family's main provider. So upon her invitation, Eun-young is already familiar with Young-hoon, who happened to be her first love when she was younger. Being on this show reignites old feelings for her old schoolmate.\n\nMarrying a Millionaire is a fun adaptation of Joe Millionaire. Although Joe Millionaire was a reality TV show, this Korean adaptation is partially inspired by it, and thus a creative yet fun drama is born. Though it has definitely aged and is very obviously a period piece, Marrying a Millionaire provides a nostalgic taste of romantic dramas of the early 2000s, when cheesy storylines and laughable tropes were the highlights of a K-drama. Marrying a Millionaire is worth watching, if not for its take on the American reality TV show, then for its cheesy romance.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n## 9 \n\n                            'Criminal Minds: Korea' (2017)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Criminal Minds' (2005)\n\nWithin the National Crime Investigation (NCI) team, there is a group of profilers whose job it is to find criminals in ongoing investigations. This team consists of Ki-hyung (Son Hyun-joo), Hyun-jun (Lee Joon-gi), Min-young (Lee Sun-bin), and others, all diverse profilers working within the unit. Team leader Ki-hyung is still traumatized after a bomb goes off in a hospital, killing SWAT team members, but he resumes his role after a certain murder case catches his attention.\n\nThis TV show is a remake of the American show of the same name. Although the American version is popular in its own right, what initially drew audiences and viewers to Criminal Minds: Korea was the cast. Lee Joon-gi, having starred in popular K-dramas Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo and Scholar Who Walks the Night, plays the lead and does so successfully, being able to attain the viewer's attention. Not to mention, for those who liked the tearjerker episodes that tugged at their hearts, this adaptation of Criminal Minds is the one. Criminal Minds: Korea ends up being a masterful and emotional adaptation.\n\nCriminal Minds: Korea is not available to stream or buy in the U.S.\n\n## 8 \n\n                            'Entourage' (2016)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Entourage' (2004)\n\nYoung-bin (Seo Kang-joon) is a rising star known for his handsomely good looks. However, there are challenges that come with fame and recognition. This leads to Young-bin relying on his three close friends, Lee Ho-jin (Park Jeong-min), Turtle (Lee Dong-hwi), Cha Joon (Lee Kwang-soo), and agent Kim Eun-gab (Cho Jin-woong), and the show follows the comedic group as they spend time together.\n\nEntourage, while hilarious and fun, features a bunch of cameos from different Korean actors, actresses, and performers, including Song Ji-hyo, Mamamoo, Kang Ha-neul, and more. Entourage is a refreshing take on the American adaptation, combined with realistic challenges relating to Korean culture, and it makes for a unique K-drama that doesn’t focus on the cheesy romances or corny tropes that K-dramas typically do. The focus falls completely on the friendship between characters, which is a refreshing take on a K-drama, as they maneuver the life of fame and stick together.\n\nEntourage is not available to stream or buy in the U.S.\n\n## 7 \n\n                            'Suits' (2018)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Suits' (2011)\n\nGo Yeon-woo (Park Hyung-sik) is a genius with an excellent photographic memory. Desperate for quick money, Yeon-woo is set up during a drug deal gone wrong, and he is followed by detectives. Yeon-woo successfully evades the police by being mistaken for a candidate at Kang &amp; Ham, a law-practicing firm. Fortunately, even though he doesn’t have a law degree, he has memorized the entirety of the lawyer’s manual. As a result, when given the opportunity by Kang-seok (Jang Dong-won) during an interview, Yeon-woo defends himself against the detectives and does so successfully. After successfully evading arrest, Yeon-woo is crowned as the new lawyer at Kang &amp; Ham. With this new opportunity to flourish as a lawyer, Yeon-woo gets rid of the drugs and begins studying so that he can become a great lawyer and change his life around.\n\nSuits plays out similarly to the American adaptation it is based on. Both Dong-won and Hyung-sik play the lead roles convincingly, with strong chemistry to start off with. The Korean adaptation of Suits is gripping, enticing viewers with the familiar and popular face of Hyung-sik while also providing plot twists at every turn. Viewers interested in this show will be on the edge of their seats for each hour-long episode.\n\nWatch on Tubi\n\n## 6 \n\n                            'Woori the Virgin' (2022)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Jane the Virgin' (2014)\n\nWoori the Virgin follows Woori (Im Soo-hyang), a young woman sworn to chastity from a young age. Because of this, she has had trouble finding love and keeping it. Although she has been dating a man for two years—Kang Jae (Shin Dong Wook)—it’s hard for them both to evade the topic of sex and take the next step. However, after accidental insemination, she ends up pregnant with CEO Raphael’s (Sung Hoon) child. This creates tension within Woori’s love life as she is torn between two men she develops feelings for. It’s just a matter of who she decides to be with and marry.\n\nWoori the Virgin is a remake of the very popular Jane the Virgin. Though shorter, it is still an enjoyable remake that gets to the point over a span of 14 episodes. It relies heavily on subtle humor and innuendos, and it does so successfully. Woori the Virgin is the perfect remake, keeping the original’s plot devices and adapting them to Korean culture while also maintaining its own identity in subtle ways. The only larger differences are some of the subplots and the timeframe in which everything happens.\n\nWatch on Viki\n\n## 5 \n\n                            'The Good Wife' (2016)\n\n### Adaptation of 'The Good Wife' (2009)\n\nThe Good Wife follows Hye-kyung (Jeon Do-yeon), a lawyer who breaks her decade-long hiatus after her husband, prosecutor Tae-joon (Yoo Ji-tae), betrays her, having gotten caught sleeping with another woman. However, the situation is worse, as he is also being accused of accepting sexual favors and bribes, thus getting in trouble in a political scandal.\n\nThe Good Wife is an excellent watch, a successful remake of the original American drama. It maintains similar cases from the original, with a bit of its own twists and cultural changes. However, because it is a much shorter series, the pacing is fast, and some of the characters don’t get the same limelight as they did in the American show. Still, with an interesting premise, the Korean remake has made The Good Wife into a unique experience that cannot be found in the American version, thus viewers will be satisfied with both versions.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n## 4 \n\n                            'Little Women' (2022)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Little Women' (2019)\n\nLittle Women follows three sisters—In-joo (Kim Go-eun), In-kyung (Nam Ji-hun), and In-hye (Park Ji-hu)—and the poverty that has stricken their family. However, a family friend has left money for the sisters, and it becomes a fight between these women and Korea’s richest family in order to receive the money.\n\nAnother show based on an American film, Little Women (Korea) is pretty different in terms of setting and characters. The American show is based in the 19th century; meanwhile, the Korean remake is more of a modern piece. Both adaptions of the novel focus on the central theme of poverty but under differing conditions of the cultural differences between Korea and America. Those who enjoyed the original will have an appreciation for this new adaption, as it tells its own story while being loosely connected to the original content. Korea’s Little Women will hook viewers from the first episode, and its thriller-like story will keep viewers entertained. A wonderful adaption that really pulls away from its American roots and tells its own story.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n## 3 \n\n                            'Designated Survivor: 60 Days' (2019)\n\n### Adaptation of 'Designated Survivor' (2016)\n\nAfter being dismissed as the Minister of Environment in South Korea, Mu-jin (Ji Jin-hee) suddenly finds himself as acting president when the National Assembly building is bombed. Everyone who was in line for succession to the presidency was killed in the explosion, except for Mu-jin, who has been officially acting president for 60 days. During these 60 days, Mu-jin attempts to uncover the people behind the bombing, and he has to survive so that a new president can be elected. Although he lacks political ambition, Mu-jin has no choice but to continue leading South Korea.\n\nSimilarly to many of the other film and television shows adapted into South Korean media, Designated Survivor: 60 Days follows the American plot closely, with the most obvious differences being the culture itself. Although a political drama, the plot itself is very exciting and gripping, and viewers will be on the edge of their seats as they follow Mu-jin in his attempts to uncover the truth behind the bombing while surviving as the sole successor to the presidency. For those who enjoy political commentary, this political thriller is by far one of the best.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n## 2 \n\n                            '18 Again' (2020)\n\n### Adaptation of '17 Again' (2009)\n\nMost viewers will probably remember Zac Efron’s hit movie 17 Again. Dae-young (Yoon Sang-hyun or Lee Do-hyun) was once a successful high school basketball prodigy. But then one day he fell in love with Da-jung (Kim Ha-neul), and soon after, an unexpected pregnancy surprises both Dae-young and Da-jung. Dae-young decides to forsake his basketball career in favor of being a responsible parent. However, many years later, Dae-young has found himself in a miserable situation: his wife wants a divorce, his teenage children want nothing to do with him, and he has been laid off. Because life has taken a turn for the worst, Dae-young wishes to fix things with his family, and he finds himself in his 18-year-old body while also maintaining his current state of mind.\n\nViewers who loved 17 Again will be very happy with the Korean remake. Because each episode is almost equivalent to a film, the original story is expanded into a thoughtful and emotional masterpiece that will bring viewers to tears every time. It is a heartwarming show about family and familial love. The show 18 Again is one of the best Korean adaptations of an American film, and it is one that viewers will remember.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n## 1 \n\n                            'Vincenzo' (2021)\n\n### Adaptation of 'The Godfather' (1972)\n\nImage via Netflix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincenzo Cassano (Song Joong-ki), previously Park Joo-hyung, is adopted by a Mafia family after his adoptive Italian parents pass away. Trained and raised by the Cassano Mafia family, Vincenzo becomes the head's right-hand man and a lawyer. However, after Don Fabio, the head, passes away, his biological son Paolo (Salvatore Alfano) becomes the new leader of the Mafia and aims to kill Vincenzo out of jealousy. Vincenzo then flees to Seoul, where he finds himself entangled with the Babel Group, a corporation that he cannot overpower with his own skills alone. So, recalling what he knows from his time in the mafia, Vincenzo applies his knowledge to obtain intel and ultimately destroy the Babel Group.\n\nAlthough not technically a full-on remake, Vincenzo very clearly takes inspiration from the original Godfather trilogy. However, while The Godfather focuses on the Dons and mafia, Vincenzo is a look into an outsider; more specifically, it takes on the perspective of a consigliere, played by the talented Song Joong-ki (Descendants of the Sun), whose acting really brings the character and story to life. Additionally, Vincenzo's humor blends in with serious moments and tense scenes well, and the rich background of the main character provides an emotional ride that viewers will not expect from this crime drama. Vincenzo is full of heart, and it is a proud adaptation of The Godfather trilogy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Your Rating\n\nYour comment has not been saved\n\n##### Vincenzo\n\n### Cast\n\n- Song Joong-ki\n- Jeon Yeo-been\n- Kwak Dong-yeon\n- Taecyeon\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\nKEEP READING: The 33 Best K-Dramas on Netflix Right Now\n\n- Movie\n- Drama\n- South Korea\n\nThread\n\nSign in to your  account\n\nWe want to hear from you!

The U.S. has had plenty of successful adaptations, ranging from horror flicks like <Name>The Grudge</Name> (<Language>Ju-On</Language>) and <Name>The Ring</Name> (<Language>Ringu</Language>) to dramas like <Name>Jane the Virgin</Name> (<Language>Juana la Virgen</Language>) and <Name>The Good Doctor</Name> (<Language>The Good Doctor</Language>). However, plenty of American original shows that have been popularized have been adapted to fit other cultural mediums.\n\nSome such countries include <CulturalContext>South Korea</CulturalContext>, which, while known for its K-drama-esque style of writing, has adapted some television and film from the U.S., incorporating its own political values and commentary that does not stray too far away from the source material. This makes for interesting takes and views through the lens of a different culture, creating an interesting conversation about the success of adaptations and what elements make a film or TV show unique to its home country. Here's to popular remakes of American TV shows and films that South Korea successfully remade into their own medium.\n\n## 10 \n\n                            <Name>Marrying a Millionaire</Name> (2005-2006)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Joe Millionaire</Name> (2003)\n\n<Name>Marrying a Millionaire</Name> follows Eun-young (Kim Hyun-joo) as she is invited to be a participant in a reality show called <Name>Marrying a Millionaire</Name>, which is about an average Joe kind of guy who can pull off acting and looking like a wealthy man. This man is Young-hoon (Go Soo), who is a hardworking citizen and is his family's main provider. So upon her invitation, Eun-young is already familiar with Young-hoon, who happened to be her first love when she was younger. Being on this show reignites old feelings for her old schoolmate.\n\n<Name>Marrying a Millionaire</Name> is a fun adaptation of <Name>Joe Millionaire</Name>. Although <Name>Joe Millionaire</Name> was a reality TV show, this Korean adaptation is partially inspired by it, and thus a creative yet fun drama is born. Though it has definitely aged and is very obviously a period piece, <Name>Marrying a Millionaire</Name> provides a nostalgic taste of romantic dramas of the early 2000s, when cheesy storylines and laughable tropes were the highlights of a K-drama. <Name>Marrying a Millionaire</Name> is worth watching, if not for its take on the American reality TV show, then for its cheesy romance.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n## 9 \n\n                            <Name>Criminal Minds: Korea</Name> (2017)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Criminal Minds</Name> (2005)\n\nWithin the National Crime Investigation (NCI) team, there is a group of profilers whose job it is to find criminals in ongoing investigations. This team consists of Ki-hyung (Son Hyun-joo), Hyun-jun (Lee Joon-gi), Min-young (Lee Sun-bin), and others, all diverse profilers working within the unit. Team leader Ki-hyung is still traumatized after a bomb goes off in a hospital, killing SWAT team members, but he resumes his role after a certain murder case catches his attention.\n\nThis TV show is a remake of the American show of the same name. Although the American version is popular in its own right, what initially drew audiences and viewers to <Name>Criminal Minds: Korea</Name> was the cast. Lee Joon-gi, having starred in popular K-dramas <Name>Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo</Name> and <Name>Scholar Who Walks the Night</Name>, plays the lead and does so successfully, being able to attain the viewer's attention. Not to mention, for those who liked the tearjerker episodes that tugged at their hearts, this adaptation of <Name>Criminal Minds</Name> is the one. <Name>Criminal Minds: Korea</Name> ends up being a masterful and emotional adaptation.\n\n<Name>Criminal Minds: Korea</Name> is not available to stream or buy in the U.S.\n\n## 8 \n\n                            <Name>Entourage</Name> (2016)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Entourage</Name> (2004)\n\nYoung-bin (Seo Kang-joon) is a rising star known for his handsomely good looks. However, there are challenges that come with fame and recognition. This leads to Young-bin relying on his three close friends, Lee Ho-jin (Park Jeong-min), Turtle (Lee Dong-hwi), Cha Joon (Lee Kwang-soo), and agent Kim Eun-gab (Cho Jin-woong), and the show follows the comedic group as they spend time together.\n\n<Name>Entourage</Name>, while hilarious and fun, features a bunch of cameos from different Korean actors, actresses, and performers, including Song Ji-hyo, Mamamoo, Kang Ha-neul, and more. <Name>Entourage</Name> is a refreshing take on the American adaptation, combined with realistic challenges relating to Korean culture, and it makes for a unique K-drama that doesn’t focus on the cheesy romances or corny tropes that K-dramas typically do. The focus falls completely on the friendship between characters, which is a refreshing take on a K-drama, as they maneuver the life of fame and stick together.\n\n<Name>Entourage</Name> is not available to stream or buy in the U.S.\n\n## 7 \n\n                            <Name>Suits</Name> (2018)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Suits</Name> (2011)\n\nGo Yeon-woo (Park Hyung-sik) is a genius with an excellent photographic memory. Desperate for quick money, Yeon-woo is set up during a drug deal gone wrong, and he is followed by detectives. Yeon-woo successfully evades the police by being mistaken for a candidate at Kang &amp; Ham, a law-practicing firm. Fortunately, even though he doesn’t have a law degree, he has memorized the entirety of the lawyer’s manual. As a result, when given the opportunity by Kang-seok (Jang Dong-won) during an interview, Yeon-woo defends himself against the detectives and does so successfully. After successfully evading arrest, Yeon-woo is crowned as the new lawyer at Kang &amp; Ham. With this new opportunity to flourish as a lawyer, Yeon-woo gets rid of the drugs and begins studying so that he can become a great lawyer and change his life around.\n\n<Name>Suits</Name> plays out similarly to the American adaptation it is based on. Both Dong-won and Hyung-sik play the lead roles convincingly, with strong chemistry to start off with. The Korean adaptation of <Name>Suits</Name> is gripping, enticing viewers with the familiar and popular face of Hyung-sik while also providing plot twists at every turn. Viewers interested in this show will be on the edge of their seats for each hour-long episode.\n\nWatch on Tubi\n\n## 6 \n\n                            <Name>Woori the Virgin</Name> (2022)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Jane the Virgin</Name> (2014)\n\n<Name>Woori the Virgin</Name> follows Woori (Im Soo-hyang), a young woman sworn to chastity from a young age. Because of this, she has had trouble finding love and keeping it. Although she has been dating a man for two years—Kang Jae (Shin Dong Wook)—it’s hard for them both to evade the topic of sex and take the next step. However, after accidental insemination, she ends up pregnant with CEO Raphael’s (Sung Hoon) child. This creates tension within Woori’s love life as she is torn between two men she develops feelings for. It’s just a matter of who she decides to be with and marry.\n\n<Name>Woori the Virgin</Name> is a remake of the very popular <Name>Jane the Virgin</Name>. Though shorter, it is still an enjoyable remake that gets to the point over a span of 14 episodes. It relies heavily on subtle humor and innuendos, and it does so successfully. <Name>Woori the Virgin</Name> is the perfect remake, keeping the original’s plot devices and adapting them to Korean culture while also maintaining its own identity in subtle ways. The only larger differences are some of the subplots and the timeframe in which everything happens.\n\nWatch on Viki\n\n## 5 \n\n                            <Name>The Good Wife</Name> (2016)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>The Good Wife</Name> (2009)\n\n<Name>The Good Wife</Name> follows Hye-kyung (Jeon Do-yeon), a lawyer who breaks her decade-long hiatus after her husband, prosecutor Tae-joon (Yoo Ji-tae), betrays her, having gotten caught sleeping with another woman. However, the situation is worse, as he is also being accused of accepting sexual favors and bribes, thus getting in trouble in a political scandal.\n\n<Name>The Good Wife</Name> is an excellent watch, a successful remake of the original American drama. It maintains similar cases from the original, with a bit of its own twists and cultural changes. However, because it is a much shorter series, the pacing is fast, and some of the characters don’t get the same limelight as they did in the American show. Still, with an interesting premise, the Korean remake has made <Name>The Good Wife</Name> into a unique experience that cannot be found in the American version, thus viewers will be satisfied with both versions.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n## 4 \n\n                            <Name>Little Women</Name> (2022)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Little Women</Name> (2019)\n\n<Name>Little Women</Name> follows three sisters—In-joo (Kim Go-eun), In-kyung (Nam Ji-hun), and In-hye (Park Ji-hu)—and the poverty that has stricken their family. However, a family friend has left money for the sisters, and it becomes a fight between these women and Korea’s richest family in order to receive the money.\n\nAnother show based on an American film, <Name>Little Women</Name> (Korea) is pretty different in terms of setting and characters. The American show is based in the 19th century; meanwhile, the Korean remake is more of a modern piece. Both adaptations of the novel focus on the central theme of poverty but under differing conditions of the cultural differences between Korea and America. Those who enjoyed the original will have an appreciation for this new adaptation, as it tells its own story while being loosely connected to the original content. Korea’s <Name>Little Women</Name> will hook viewers from the first episode, and its thriller-like story will keep viewers entertained. A wonderful adaptation that really pulls away from its American roots and tells its own story.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n## 3 \n\n                            <Name>Designated Survivor: 60 Days</Name> (2019)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>Designated Survivor</Name> (2016)\n\nAfter being dismissed as the Minister of Environment in South Korea, Mu-jin (Ji Jin-hee) suddenly finds himself as acting president when the National Assembly building is bombed. Everyone who was in line for succession to the presidency was killed in the explosion, except for Mu-jin, who has been officially acting president for 60 days. During these 60 days, Mu-jin attempts to uncover the people behind the bombing, and he has to survive so that a new president can be elected. Although he lacks political ambition, Mu-jin has no choice but to continue leading South Korea.\n\nSimilarly to many of the other film and television shows adapted into South Korean media, <Name>Designated Survivor: 60 Days</Name> follows the American plot closely, with the most obvious differences being the culture itself. Although a political drama, the plot itself is very exciting and gripping, and viewers will be on the edge of their seats as they follow Mu-jin in his attempts to uncover the truth behind the bombing while surviving as the sole successor to the presidency. For those who enjoy political commentary, this political thriller is by far one of the best.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n## 2 \n\n                            <Name>18 Again</Name> (2020)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>17 Again</Name> (2009)\n\nMost viewers will probably remember Zac Efron’s hit movie <Name>17 Again</Name>. Dae-young (Yoon Sang-hyun or Lee Do-hyun) was once a successful high school basketball prodigy. But then one day he fell in love with Da-jung (Kim Ha-neul), and soon after, an unexpected pregnancy surprises both Dae-young and Da-jung. Dae-young decides to forsake his basketball career in favor of being a responsible parent. However, many years later, Dae-young has found himself in a miserable situation: his wife wants a divorce, his teenage children want nothing to do with him, and he has been laid off. Because life has taken a turn for the worst, Dae-young wishes to fix things with his family, and he finds himself in his 18-year-old body while also maintaining his current state of mind.\n\nViewers who loved <Name>17 Again</Name> will be very happy with the Korean remake. Because each episode is almost equivalent to a film, the original story is expanded into a thoughtful and emotional masterpiece that will bring viewers to tears every time. It is a heartwarming show about family and familial love. The show <Name>18 Again</Name> is one of the best Korean adaptations of an American film, and it is one that viewers will remember.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n## 1 \n\n                            <Name>Vincenzo</Name> (2021)\n\n### Adaptation of <Name>The Godfather</Name> (1972)\n\nImage via Netflix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<Name>Vincenzo</Name> Cassano (Song Joong-ki), previously Park Joo-hyung, is adopted by a Mafia family after his adoptive Italian parents pass away. Trained and raised by the Cassano Mafia family, <Name>Vincenzo</Name> becomes the head's right-hand man and a lawyer. However, after Don Fabio, the head, passes away, his biological son Paolo (Salvatore Alfano) becomes the new leader of the Mafia and aims to kill <Name>Vincenzo</Name> out of jealousy. <Name>Vincenzo</Name> then flees to Seoul, where he finds himself entangled with the Babel Group, a corporation that he cannot overpower with his own skills alone. So, recalling what he knows from his time in the mafia, <Name>Vincenzo</Name> applies his knowledge to obtain intel and ultimately destroy the Babel Group.\n\nAlthough not technically a full-on remake, <Name>Vincenzo</Name> very clearly takes inspiration from the original <Name>The Godfather</Name> trilogy. However, while <Name>The Godfather</Name> focuses on the Dons and mafia, <Name>Vincenzo</Name> is a look into an outsider; more specifically, it takes on the perspective of a consigliere, played by the talented Song Joong-ki (<Name>Descendants of the Sun</Name>), whose acting really brings the character and story to life. Additionally, <Name>Vincenzo</Name>'s humor blends in with serious moments and tense scenes well, and the rich background of the main character provides an emotional ride that viewers will not expect from this crime drama. <Name>Vincenzo</Name> is full of heart, and it is a proud adaptation of <Name>The Godfather</Name> trilogy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Your Rating\n\nYour comment has not been saved\n\n##### <Name>Vincenzo</Name>\n\n### Cast\n\n- Song Joong-ki\n- Jeon Yeo-been\n- Kwak Dong-yeon\n- Taecyeon\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH\n\n######\n\nKEEP READING: The 33 Best K-Dramas on Netflix Right Now\n\n- Movie\n- Drama\n- South Korea\n\nThread\n\nSign in to your  account\n\nWe want to hear from you!

John H. Lee A Moment to Remember (2004) John H. Lee's films are imbued with top-notch cosmopolitan sensibilities. He has become one of the most sought after directors in all of East Asia and is a member of the rising generation of international directors from the region, having both a distinct voice as an auteur and wide commercial appeal with diverse genres of films. Born in Seoul, Korea, Lee moved to the U.S. at the age of 12. Upon graduating from the film school at New York University, Lee made his feature debut with \"The Cut Runs Deep,\" a poetic independent film about East Asian youth gangs in New York City. After running the festival circuit around the world, \"The Cut Runs Deep\" was released in Korea in 2000 and instantly became a cult classic.Since his successful debut, Lee has directed numerous international music videos and T.V. commercials in East Asia and Europe, eventually opting to move his residence back to Seoul in search of his spiritual roots. In 2004, Lee directed his second feature film, a love story, entitled, \"A Moment to Remember\". It was Lee's first Korean-language film; a passionate, psychologically complex, and emotionally charged story about a man and a woman, two star-crossed lovers, separated by the slow loss of the woman's memory. \"A Moment to Remember\" instantly became the highest grossing domestic film in the romance genre in the history of Korean cinema. Subsequently released in Japan the following year, \"A Moment to Remember\" has become the most successful Korean film ever in Japan, a record that still stands. \"A Moment to Remember\" is considered by many to be a romance masterpiece, standing above all other romantic films in East Asia.After a long search for projects to expand his horizons, John H. Lee next took on an experimental challenge, his third feature film, titled \"Sayonara Itsuka,\" based on a Japanese novel of the same title. It was wildly innovative in that he made a flawless Japanese-language film with top Japanese actors, utilizing the best Korean film crew. Some thought it couldn't be done, or at least, couldn't be done well. Lee didn't speak Japanese, and the production proved to be very arduous and difficult in every aspect, but when the movie was finally released in Japan in 2010, it blew the audience away with a passionate telling of a lost love that spans 25 years. The Japanese audiences were shocked by the beauty and scale of the film, and it was yet another critical box office hit in Japan.For his fourth opus, John H. Lee took another surprise turn. It was a historical Korean War epic, titled \"71/ Into the Fire,\" based on a true story about a group of 71 student soldiers fighting to protect a school during the outset of the \"forgotten\" Korean War in 1950.Lee took another step towards a new frontier when he accepted an invitation to helm a Chinese film, \"The Third Way of Love\", based on a best-selling novel in China, a love story between a wealthy corporate heir and a beautiful, but recently divorced lawyer.Lee also recently saw box office success in Korea with \"Operation Chromite\", a true story about an intel-warfare between South and North Korea during Korean War. Aside from starring A-list Korean actors such as Lee Jung Jae and Lee Bum Soo, \"Operation Chromite\" also received lots of attention for being the first Korean film to cast an A-list Hollywood actor in a prominent role. Liam Neeson delivers powerfully as General Douglas MacArthur in this intense film about the military operation that was decisive in turning the tide of the Korean War.John H.

The quintessential classic revenge joint post-'Vengeance Trilogy' is sinister, packed with tension and heightened suspense throughout.\n\nWritten and directed by Na Hong-jin of 'The Wailing' fame, in his feature debut,'The Chaser' is an unconventional detective film based on a true story about the infamous Raincoat Killer. Hailed by critics at the time and set in the rainy hills of the Mangwon neighbourhood in Seoul, Joong-ho Eom (Kim Yoon-seok), the former detective turned pimp who sees his girls go missing one after the other faces Young-min (Ha Jung-woo, The Handmaiden) the psychopathic serial killer who targets call girls.\n\nKim-Yoon Seok’s dirtbag performance as deadbeat Joong-ho is stellar. Well liked, he still carries a lot of weight as a well known former cop who accepted bribes. Detached from his own behaviour and consequences, we are not sympathetic to the character, who believes himself to be above the law though ultimately due to his shady business ventures, it is him who is to blame for putting the women in harm's way. Paranoid, he suspects the girls have quit and run off or worse, sold.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL\n\nAfter another girl goes missing Joong-ho forces Mi-jin (Seo Young-hee) into work for the evening. Unwell with the cold due to all the rain, Mi-jin is cared for by her young daughter Eun-ji, played by Kim Yoo-jung who is a standout amongst the morally corrupt in this world. Looking through his scribbled notes for a lead, Joong-ho notices a number ending in 4885 as the last customer linked with the missing girls, the same customer Mi-jin is sent to. Like a scene from 'LA Noire', we hear a mysterious clue jingle whenever the rogue ex-cop is on to something as he thinks he has it all figured out. Speculating 4885 is to blame for trafficking his girls, Mi-jin is used to assist in the pursuit, though a sense of dread builds rapidly as we know that is not quite the case. The set up for a plan that we know is going to fail as another girl is in peril.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBrutal beatings ensue followed by a frantic, heart racing shot to perfection chase sequence between the two men, who coincidentally cross paths in hilarious form before both being arrested. This section feels like it's from another movie, one more of a black comedy with the driest delivery and forthcomingness from the psychopathic killer when questioned by police. Not sparing the details, Jung-woo’s performance is fantastic in these scenes as he scrapes by with no conscience, remorseless and almost dead behind the eyes. The nihilistic world in which this is set is so depressing and unrelenting. Topped off with a justice system that fails at every corner, we see the disgraced cop as our only hope. The cigarette smoking man who stops at nothing, dishing out casual beatings and launching chairs at anyone standing or cowering in his path does more to antagonise the police and misdirect their attention away from the killer.\n\nDue to the pressures on the police after some bad press, they can’t afford to mess this up and withholding a suspect without evidence who appears to be beaten is not the look they need right now. It’s interesting as we face the killer in the opening moments knowing what he’s capable of, though it takes the others some convincing. Thinking this is about to fall under the ‘Guys Having a Bad Night’ movie category, night turns to day with masterful suspense. Followed by the head shaking depiction of the police and abhorrent shitshow that transpires with the mayor and the media, the film then turns to a rat race in the hills to find the exact location of the girls and if there is enough time to save them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThough there are graphic, gory moments that are unsettling, Ha Hong-jin decides against showing extreme violence just for the sake of it and changes his approach throughout the film. The setting feels claustrophobic though despite the grim depths of disparity, the cinematography of the city is beautiful in the rain as is the slow-motion existential shots of a hopeless Joong-ho smoking in his trench coat. There is a shift with Joong-ho’s hero complex from caring about nothing except money, he is then challenged to aid in caring for Eun-ji. The young girl is a survivalist, strong and very smart, as she questions him not giving up on finding her mum. There are also lighter moments between the two that show the films depth with Joong-ho unwillingly stepping in poorly to provide brief guardianship to Mi-jin’s daughter. The unlikely due akin to Cassavetes’ 'Gloria' or more famously 'Leon the Professional'.\n\nFOLLOW THE DISSECTION PODCAST\n\nThe architecture of the place is huge in the story and almost acts menacing when getting further up the hill towards the concealed house and the ominous glowing cross. We feel the fatigue of the characters as each house must be checked, meanwhile back at the murder ranch Mi-jin has been left for dead in a filthy tiled bathroom that appears to be straight from 'Saw'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe film has a great portion in the middle focused on the police and the film becomes more courtroom drama rather than psychological thriller, allowing us space to breath before returning to the chase, the violence and tense moments. In a world where the police look more favourably at a serial killer than a corrupt cop turned pimp, they are more mostly concerned about being insulted. The brutal way in which the story unfolds is unforgiving and will knock the wind out of you. The convoluted judicial system is embarrassing and confusing, taking some work to wrap your head around the clown show political tactics that force us to turn to the antihero. An interesting commentary on the inadequacies of the police with their feeble attempts and timidness with the killer during their soft approach.\n\nThe subplot with religious themes doesn’t really work as it’s barely touched on for most of the film and only as a footnote. It leads to some dramatic and interesting shots but didn’t leave a lasting impression that it was integral to the character involved. These elements felt a little too close to 'Se7en' ripoff and less of its own thing. In the press release Ha Hong-jin compared the film to the story of two surviving dogs in an abandoned village after a bout of unending rain. One holding the other in the clenches of its jaws. A gripping tale, with twists and turns and a level of pessimism rarely achieved with its western counterparts. For fans of Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' and Kim Jee-woon's 'I Saw the Devil'.\n\nVerdict: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n-Gary McIlhagga\n\n'The Chaser' is on Digital Platforms from April 8th.\n\n- Korean Cinema\n- Gary McIlhagga\n- The Chaser\n- Na Hong-jin\n- Kim Yoon-seok\n- Ha Jung-woo\n\n- Film Review\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoris Karloff as the \"Other\" in The Mummy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe New Mutants: A Retrospective\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFILM REVIEW: Immaculate (2024)\n\n## FOLLOW FRIGHT CLUB\n\n\"Initiation's over...it's time to join the club!\"\n\nBECOME A CENOFRIGHT\n\n### SUPPORT FRIGHT CLUB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n# Private Policy\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED The Fright Club NI™",

            "content": "# TheMarckoguy\n\n## \"TheMarckoguy\" is the alternate name for Markus. Markus is a human who reviews stuff.\n\n- Home\n- About\n- My Favorite Scenes\n- Suggestions\n\n# Along with the Gods: The Two Movies\n\nHi there. So this won’t be a typical review style post of mine (though it shares minor aspects of those). Instead it’ll be more like my post on the Fable movies (AHEM AHEM), loosely rambling about them in a bundled post. I should mention that both movies will from here on out simply be referred to by their subtitle, as it’d be too long and clunky to use the full title each time. So anyhow… let’s go.\n\nThe Two Worlds\n\nAfter perishing in the line of duty, a firefighter (Cha Tae-Hyun) finds himself in the company of three spirit guides (Ha Jung-woo, Ju Ji-Hoon, Kim Hyang-gi) who have been tasked with guiding him through the afterlife in order for him to potentially earn the right to reincarnate. Based on a webtoon by Ju Ho-min, “The Two Worlds” is an interesting blend of inspirations and tones. Most noticeably, it uses Buddhist philosophy as a springboard to tell an interesting and really fun fantasy adventure story, a morality tale that also happens to have some really fun VFX-driven action and colorful characters. Taking us through visually distinct environments to tell a nuanced fantasy story.\n\nAs we follow the firefighter’s journey through the afterlife, we get to know him more and more, seeing what led him to the initial incident. We see why he does what he does, we get to know the deepest inner workings of his soul, and finding out just how complex even the most seemingly good people are. And the way that affects the events of the movie, the ways his guides have to assist him, it makes for some compelling drama and some surprising suspense. So when we get to the climactic trials that are crucial in determining his fate, it put me on the edge of my seat, and also may have caused the waterworks to begin operating. Because while someone might come to this for the spectacular VFX, fun action scenes, or extremely good looking cast, soon enough they’ll also find that this movie has a strong emotional core as well. I am not ashamed in admitting that this movie made me cry. It’s one of those flashy action flicks that also happens to have some truly compelling characters and drama. But it can also be quite funny at times, especially with the quips and general demeanor of Ju Ji-Hoon as the delightful Haewonmaek.\n\nWhat else is there to say? It’s a big popcorn flick with a great story, plenty of heart, a wonderful cast of characters, and some mesmerizing visuals. I loved it.\n\nThe Last 49 Days\n\nReleased a year later, “The Last 49 Days” sees our favorite spirit guides as they take on the task of helping a new soul towards reincarnation, all while also trying their damndest in trying to retrieve a fellow guardian (Ma Dong-seok) who’s been living on Earth for a long time. “The Last 49 Days” is once again a blend of things. Fantasy action, historical epic, domestic dramedy, and I think all these individual pieces are great… but together they don’t flow super well. I get that you need all the bits together to tell the complete story, take one piece out and the tower comes crashing down, but there is a whole lotta movie to this movie. And I’m not just talking about runtime, as it’s really only like 5 minutes longer than the first one, but rather it’s how much is crammed into it. There’s an exhausting amount of narrative threads going on at any one time, and while I found all of them pretty compelling on their own, their flow is just almost non-existent. It’s especially horrid near the middle of the movie, where things really begin to drag. You know that deep sigh you make when you’re bored? Yeah, that happened here. It’s just an exhausting drag at times.\n\nSo while the story is a mess, the characters do get some really interesting extra depth, which also leads to the actors getting more to chew on. The cast was great in the first one, but they really get to flex their acting chops here, and I think they give terrific performances here. And it’s just nice to have Ma Dong-seok be part of proceedings, the man just slots in flawlessly and brings such a unique charisma.\n\nAction scenes are once again a lot of fun, not quite as flashy as what we saw in the first one, but definitely still highly enjoyable. Effects are still top notch (bar one or two obvious green screens), costumes and makeup are solid, and there’s some really fun cuts and transitions spread throughout. It’s just stellar on a technical level.\n\nSo while nowhere near as strong as its predecessor, I can’t say that I disliked “The Last 49 Days”. It still has some great stuff to it. If the first one’s a strong 9/10 for me, then this is maybe a weak 7/10. Hurt by its poor pacing, but still has a lot to admire.\n\nSo yeah, I watched and generally liked the “Along with the Gods” movies. Basically if you like big spectacle with plenty of heart and don’t mind reading subtitles, then I can easily recommend them. And apparently there’s a third and fourth one coming at some point… so I’ll be cautiously looking forward to those.\n\nHave a good one.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Twitter\n- Facebook\n\n, ,\n\n# Post navigation\n\n## 3 thoughts on “Along with the Gods: The Two Movies”\n\n- beetleypete \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t17/12/2022 at 11:30 am\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nBoth new to me, but Korean Cinema is usually very good, so I will look out for them.\n\nBest wishes, Pete.\n\n\nReply\n- Pingback: Disney Plus/Marvel Series Roundup: Part 1 | TheMarckoguy\n- Pingback: Markus Pulls a Barbenheimer | TheMarckoguy\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nΔ\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

To this day, actually, I can still remember watching the final pulsating moments of the film for the first time. I was glued to the screen, unable to look away.\n\nThe story is based off of Haruki Murakami’s short story, Barn Burning, published in The New Yorker magazine in 1992. Lee’s adaptation starts off with Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), a young delivery guy and aspiring writer who lives isolated from urban society in a lonely house on the outskirts of Seoul. His journey begins when, while out in delivery, he meets a childhood friend, Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo). She’s comes off as extremely friendly and confident, opposed to the awkwardness of our protagonist. Since she’s so excited to meet him again after all the years, she invites him to hang out.\n\nJong-su quickly forms a subtle attachment to her that Yoo manages to capture flawlessly. In fact, Jong-su grows so fond of Hae-mi so quickly, we can sense just how bad he was craving human interaction. When Hae-mi goes out of town to vacation in Africa for a while, he asks Jong-su to take care of her cat, which he obviously accepts.\n\nBy the time Hae-mi returns, she has a friend by her side. The mysterious Ben, played by Steven Yeun. Ben is a continuous figure of mystery from the get go, and throughout the whole film. We learn that he is attractive, charismatic, and has a lot of money, although we never quite learn what he does for a living. As Jong-su later phrases it so well, he is like a Gatsby figure. To Jong-su’s dismay, Ben is going to stick around for a while, winning over Hae-mi’s attention.\n\nYoo Ah-in, Jeon Jong-seo and Steven Yeun in Burning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLee Chang-dong is a master in many aspects of his craft. He is in total control of his films, and it shows. Burning, for example, is a straight up thriller, but it’s not your average Hollywood thriller. Even if the description I just wrote above makes it sound like a South Korean romantic comedy about a zany love triangle, it’s far from anything remotely funny. Soon after Ben is introduced to the equation, he reveals to Jong-su his secret passion/hobby; abandoned greenhouse burning.\n\nThe film takes a smooth turn by this point. It only builds up its tension from that moment on. As the viewer, I knew something was deeply wrong. The story continues to flow at the same pace as before. I loved that Chang-dong opted to make Burning a slow, quiet film. Editing is slow paced, and shots linger for extended periods of time. We spend quite a while looking at our protagonist’s confused expression. Music is passive and not very loud. Chang-dong utilizes all of these characteristics and builds an incredibly tense and disturbing atmosphere without any sort of release. It’s just momentum building up towards the end.\n\nBurning can be argued to be about many things. Aside from the very literal story line following Ben’s mysterious reveal, I personally see it as a study in alienation, and even a bit of toxic masculinity. When Ben first arrives in the picture, we don’t know if Jong-su’s jealousy towards him and Hae-mi is what creates the tension, or if something is actually wrong with the newly introduced character. Jong-su obsesses over this new male figure who is more successful, better looking and smarter than he is. By the end of the film, even if there are nods that point away from this, one might assume that Jong-su is consumed by this inferiority complex he struggles with.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJong-su might be the protagonist, but his mostly awkward and clueless attitude would make it hard to relate if we as an audience weren’t in his same situation. So, consequentially, I found him to be compelling in a weird situational way. Steven Yeun, though, shines bright as the sociopathic (or psychopathic?) Ben. He never really breaks, or allows his inner demons to surface. His face is calm, he talks in a nonchalant way, as if he has no care for the world. In case you are wondering, there are no American Psycho moments in this film. Do not expect Yeun to chase Jong-su covered in blood with a chainsaw. Nonetheless, Ben comes off as one of the scariest film characters I have ever seen. Much like Anthony Hopkins’ performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, Yeun is a charming type of evil. One that you know is sketchy, who isn’t showing his real face most of the time, but might reveal itself at any moment.\n\nI kept waiting for that moment the whole film, but it never came. By the end, I was even more disturbed than how I thought I could be. Lee does not answer questions by the end, and even though he leaves subtle clues sprinkled here and there, I still can’t shake off the feeling of ambiguity. Was Ben the real monster? Or was it Jong-su’s fragile masculinity that drove him to insanity?\n\nWhile inclusion wasn’t exactly in the directors mind, it does showcase a pretty honest and authentic glimpse into South Korean society and culture. It’s also a refreshing take on the thriller genre that deals a lot less with shock value and a lot more with the nature of our characters. We get to know Jong-su and Hae-mi to a pretty good extent, and they are both portrayed as real people who live real lives. I loved to see a different way of representing Asian people than the usual Hollywood way.\n\nBurning is one of the best movies of 2018, or maybe even one of the best from the last decade. A must watch for thriller fans, it will crawl into your skin and make you feel uneasy for two and a half hours. Lee Chang-dong proves that South Korean cinema deserves top recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSouth Korea\n\n2018\n\nSteven Yeun\n\nHaruki Murakami\n\nThriller\n\n--\n\n--\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Published in incluvie\n\nMovie and TV Reviews for Diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Written by Raul Flores\n\nMexican journalist and self-proclaimed film critic.\n\n## No responses yet\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\nTeams",

It’s not that I didn’t like Park Chan-Wook’s “The Handmaiden,” but there is one element of it in particular, the one that has granted it much notoriety, that I did not groove with: the graphic sex scenes. I can usually put aside matters of personal taste in giving credit where credit is due, a pertinent example being my review of “Raw” last week; I hate body horror, and although I despised “Raw,” I could still get past my own squeamishness and recognize its success. I enjoyed “The Handmaiden” much more in every aspect, and yet, this one element just didn’t work for me on a level that almost capsizes everything that the film is going for. This review should be read more as a bad first impression rather than as something more definitive, largely because aside from this one thing, “The Handmaiden” is dense with meaning.\n\n“The Handmaiden” follows several characters in their intertwining schemes for love, power and money. Sookee (Kim Tae-ri), is a poor pickpocket and thief, hired by Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-Woo)as a handmaiden to the wealthy Lady Hideko (Kim Min-Hee), the niece of a rich Korean collector of rare Japanese books, Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong). As Hideko’s handmaiden, Sookee is expected to convince her to fall in love with the Count and marry him. With her inheritance attained, Sookee and The Count would pull a switcheroo to get Hideko into the nuthouse while the two of them run away and divide the spoils. There’s one problem, however: Sookee and Hideko are beginning to fall in love with each other. What “The Handmaiden” does particularly well is scattering the information it gives to a viewer; within this simple plot, there are plenty of twists, but the beauty is in how the film fills in these gaps in each progressing act, in which chronology doubles over and darts between past and present to slowly give you the entire picture.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting revelation is that Hideko’s abusive uncle is actually a pornography collector. Her aunt (who died by her own hand) and now her, have been used as readers (and by extension, actors) of these pornographic texts for Kouzuki’s wealthy friends. “The Handmaiden” presents one of the bleakest presentations of misogyny I’ve ever seen put to screen. But this is then contrasted by Sookee and Hideko’s love. The vulnerability between them, in my mind, is meant to oppose the objectifying, violent, abusive relationships that men impose on the two of them throughout the film. Their scenes, both using and forgoing dialogue, are laden with romantic tension, and we see their relationship gain greater dimensionality as the gaps in the story are filled. Many have praised “The Handmaiden” as the ultimate “be gay, do crime,” story, and, in theory, they’re right. Their love matched against the sheer evil that the men present, compounded with the intensity of the story’s twists and turns, should make this a no-brainer.\n\nHowever, we again return to the sex scenes, which, as it turns out, involve Sookee and Hideko. I should state before we go any further: that I’m a straight man should likely be taken into account for the following critiques. I’m not the most knowledgeable of queer cinema, but I do know how these scenes came across to me. In my view, the scenes not only lasted way too long, but considering how graphic they are, it felt as if they were present more for the pleasure of a male viewer than they were to tell the story. If Sookee and Hideko’s relationship is meant to work opposite to the men’s cruelty, it feels odd that its defining feature, the sex, feels refracted through a male gaze. Perhaps, this is intentional: that the intimacy between Sookee and Hideko is shot so explicitly and allowed to go on forever could be meant to echo how the men perceive and enjoy the readings in Kouzuki’s house (one of which, we are shown, is of a book detailing lesbian intercourse). Through this reading, the male gaze becomes inescapable; though Sookee and Hideko’s love for one another pushes against the heteronormative violence that seeks to trap them, their love will remain an object of a man’s gaze and enjoyment. Regardless, the fact is that I felt scuzzy watching it, and the creepiness of this voyeurism ultimately sullied my reflections on the film.\n\nThen again, perhaps this is my fault; graphic sex is just not my thing in the way of painting a picture of an intimate, romantic relationship. It feels too easy, like a physical way of telling rather than showing. Just in case you doubted that these two liked each other, here’s a three-minute, multi-shot sequence of them scissoring. Over. Kill. It completely takes me out of the story and turns the movie into a porno; it becomes less about the characters’ relationship and more about how far an envelope can be pushed. Admittedly, what we have here is a case of an individual element overpowering everything else about a film, compounded by the limitations of my own individual perspective. 1,000 words feels like too few for me to be able to get past it, and it likely requires a more open-minded rewatch in the future. It’s a shame too, since, clearly, “The Handmaiden” is going for something interesting here, with a great deal of cinematic craft. It’s funny, I say it’s deploying a cheap tactic, but this also feels like a cheap cop-out on my part, especially in my last review of the term. I promise, I’ll give “The Handmaiden” another chance someday, but I think I need to recover from it (and become more acquainted with feminist literary criticism) first, before feeling comfortable with giving it another stab.\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\n7\n\n3\n\nMore to Discover\n\n### The Carletonian\n\nCarleton College's student newspaper since 1877\n\n- Home\n- Staff\n- About\n\n### Comments (7)\n\nCancel reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

But every camera shot of the explicit as well as non-explicit intimate scenes where intended to be a female point of view whether it be literal line-of-sight or a mind’s eye view belonging to a female. The audience was meant to see the movie from a female gaze perspective. Any audience member who is not a female lesbian, is most certainly trying to having an added layer of disorientation regardless of whether they like the scenes or not.\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Recommend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://thecarletonian.com/18548/viewpoint/a-bad-first-impression-a-review-of-the-handmaiden/#comment-446\n- L Lisa • Jul 3, 2024 at 5:43 pm The claims about the length and explicitness of the lesbian sex scenes are subjective.

I rarely find good lesbian eroticism. When I was younger, no one taught me about lesbian sex- I didn’t know how it worked or that it was even possible, just like the main characters in the beginning. I actually cried while watching this film. I was turned on, happy, and sad at the same time. I felt seen and loved. The film expressed how men objectify women- and lesbian sex by extension- while ignoring lesbians themselves. None of the lesbian sex in this movie was written for men. Woman’s gaze this, man’s gaze that. I’m a woman who appreciates two beautiful women having sex, likely more than any man does. And to me, it felt like the eroticism was written by a woman anyway. I looked it up, and sure enough, it was. Are gay women not allowed to have cheap thrills or enjoy sex scenes the same way straight people do in film just because men may also enjoy them? This goes for gay men, too. Are they not allowed to enjoy sex scenes in film just because women may also enjoy them? In the first place, why is it a problem for more than one demographic to enjoy gay sex scenes as long as they are made with respect? As long as the straight people who view them aren’t trying to force gay people to sleep with them in real life, I can’t think of any. This film actually had the man who tried that killed off. Acting like lesbians aren’t horny and can’t enjoy graphic sex scenes in queer media because it “cheapens it”, whatever that means…, is such a weird take to me.\n\nI thought the sex scenes in The Handmaiden were the opposite of cheap; the characters were well-written, the shots were well-done, and there was tension, subtlety, depth, and beauty. I was like, finally, some good fucking food, just to go online to see people having a fit about lesbian sex being shown in a movie that had deep and relevant themes as well. I don’t think lesbian sex is cheap, and I think eroticism and serious takes about the sexual degradation of women and how it makes gay women feel can exist in the same film without “cheapening the message”; in fact, it almost drove the point home. I was like, wow, I’m sure men will watch this film and fetishize it, but they’ll never feel the joy, longing, and understanding I felt while watching it. And they probably won’t realize that the film they’re getting off to essentially wants them dead. Saying wlw sex is cheap would be an insult to myself. But I guess some lesbians may see it differently.\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Recommend\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://thecarletonian.com/18548/viewpoint/a-bad-first-impression-a-review-of-the-handmaiden/#comment-464\n- S Sookee • Jun 23, 2024 at 11:41 pm Correct.

            "spanned_content": "<article>\n    <title>A Bad First Impression: A Review of <Name>The Handmaiden</Name></title>\n    <content>\n        Nothing makes you feel more “wrong” as a critic than discovering that you swim against the current in regards to a work generally regarded as a masterpiece. It’s not that I didn’t like <Director>Park Chan-Wook</Director>'s <Name>The Handmaiden</Name>, but there is one element of it in particular, the one that has granted it much notoriety, that I did not groove with: the graphic sex scenes. I can usually put aside matters of personal taste in giving credit where credit is due, a pertinent example being my review of “Raw” last week; I hate body horror, and although I despised “Raw,” I could still get past my own squeamishness and recognize its success. I enjoyed <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> much more in every aspect, and yet, this one element just didn’t work for me on a level that almost capsizes everything that the film is going for. This review should be read more as a bad first impression rather than as something more definitive, largely because aside from this one thing, <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> is dense with meaning.\n\n        <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> follows several characters in their intertwining schemes for love, power and money. Sookee (Kim Tae-ri), is a poor pickpocket and thief, hired by Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-Woo) as a handmaiden to the wealthy Lady Hideko (Kim Min-Hee), the niece of a rich Korean collector of rare Japanese books, Kouzuki (Cho Jin-woong). As Hideko’s handmaiden, Sookee is expected to convince her to fall in love with the Count and marry him. With her inheritance attained, Sookee and The Count would pull a switcheroo to get Hideko into the nuthouse while the two of them run away and divide the spoils. There’s one problem, however: Sookee and Hideko are beginning to fall in love with each other. What <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> does particularly well is scattering the information it gives to a viewer; within this simple plot, there are plenty of twists, but the beauty is in how the film fills in these gaps in each progressing act, in which chronology doubles over and darts between past and present to slowly give you the entire picture.\n\n        Perhaps the most interesting revelation is that Hideko’s abusive uncle is actually a pornography collector. Her aunt (who died by her own hand) and now her, have been used as readers (and by extension, actors) of these pornographic texts for Kouzuki’s wealthy friends. <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> presents one of the bleakest presentations of misogyny I’ve ever seen put to screen. But this is then contrasted by Sookee and Hideko’s love. The vulnerability between them, in my mind, is meant to oppose the objectifying, violent, abusive relationships that men impose on the two of them throughout the film. Their scenes, both using and forgoing dialogue, are laden with romantic tension, and we see their relationship gain greater dimensionality as the gaps in the story are filled. Many have praised <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> as the ultimate “be gay, do crime,” story, and, in theory, they’re right. Their love matched against the sheer evil that the men present, compounded with the intensity of the story’s twists and turns, should make this a no-brainer.\n\n        However, we again return to the sex scenes, which, as it turns out, involve Sookee and Hideko. I should state before we go any further: that I’m a straight man should likely be taken into account for the following critiques. I’m not the most knowledgeable of queer cinema, but I do know how these scenes came across to me. In my view, the scenes not only lasted way too long, but considering how graphic they are, it felt as if they were present more for the pleasure of a male viewer than they were to tell the story. If Sookee and Hideko’s relationship is meant to work opposite to the men’s cruelty, it feels odd that its defining feature, the sex, feels refracted through a male gaze. Perhaps, this is intentional: that the intimacy between Sookee and Hideko is shot so explicitly and allowed to go on forever could be meant to echo how the men perceive and enjoy the readings in Kouzuki’s house (one of which, we are shown, is of a book detailing lesbian intercourse). Through this reading, the male gaze becomes inescapable; though Sookee and Hideko’s love for one another pushes against the heteronormative violence that seeks to trap them, their love will remain an object of a man’s gaze and enjoyment. Regardless, the fact is that I felt scuzzy watching it, and the creepiness of this voyeurism ultimately sullied my reflections on the film.\n\n        Then again, perhaps this is my fault; graphic sex is just not my thing in the way of painting a picture of an intimate, romantic relationship. It feels too easy, like a physical way of telling rather than showing. Just in case you doubted that these two liked each other, here’s a three-minute, multi-shot sequence of them scissoring. Over. Kill. It completely takes me out of the story and turns the movie into a porno; it becomes less about the characters’ relationship and more about how far an envelope can be pushed. Admittedly, what we have here is a case of an individual element overpowering everything else about a film, compounded by the limitations of my own individual perspective. 1,000 words feels like too few for me to be able to get past it, and it likely requires a more open-minded rewatch in the future. It’s a shame too, since, clearly, <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> is going for something interesting here, with a great deal of cinematic craft. It’s funny, I say it’s deploying a cheap tactic, but this also feels like a cheap cop-out on my part, especially in my last review of the term. I promise, I’ll give <Name>The Handmaiden</Name> another chance someday, but I think I need to recover from it (and become more acquainted with feminist literary criticism) first, before feeling comfortable with giving it another stab.\n\n        <AdditionalInformation>\n            Rating: 3.5/5\n        </AdditionalInformation>\n    </content>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have tagged the relevant sections according to the attributes specified in the ADT.

We’ve been wanting to cover movies for so long, but barring cloning and/or dangerous 4th dimension travel, we had to find someone awesome who loves dramas and movies and the DB community just as much as we do. Be on the lookout for new features! Without further ado, here’s tony! -girlfriday]\n\nCompelling, passionate, thrilling, heart-warming, dark, and above all well-acted, it is no surprise why The Man From Nowhere (aka Ajusshi) swept the board with awards last year. The partnership of Won Bin and Kim Sae-Ron is excellent, and their chemistry as mysterious man and the little girl who loves him is incredible.\n\nThis movie is beautifully constructed in both visual and story aspects. The sheer emotion this movie elicits is simply unspeakable: from the pain of societal rejection, to hopelessness, to unadulterated anger, and finally a sense of what it means to purely love. It is definitely a must-see.\n\nTHE MAN FROM NOWHERE REVIEW\n\nThe premise of The Man From Nowhere centers around a mysterious Ajusshi named CHA TAE-SHIK (Won Bin), who is very solitary and largely stigmatized as a societal outcast. He is befriended by his neighbor’s daughter JUNG SO-MI (Kim Sae-ron) who is also looked upon with disdain because of her socioeconomic status. So-mi’s mother gets involved in a complex drug ring that leads to her and her daughter’s kidnapping, and the only person who can rescue them is Tae-shik. He goes to any lengths to save the one little girl who believes in him. It is an action-packed, rollercoaster of emotions that will grab hold of you until the very end.\n\nThis movie is wonderful from a multitude of aspects that I will try my hardest to capture in this review. First and foremost, I must call attention to the extensive pool of talented actors.\n\nWe meet our hero, Tae-shik, who looks a little disheveled and very much like an outcast, but despite his appearance he still manages to show a sweet side admiring some white flowers. He arrives at his residence where we meet So-mi for the first time. She is an energetic girl, talking to Tae-shik despite his refusal to respond with little more than monosyllabic answers.\n\nI love this duo because it’s so unexpected, but they fit each other so well. He’s so silent and solemn and she’s so energetic and youthful. They also don’t act like they have a typical adult/child relationship, but they’re more like argumentative best friends. So-mi is without a doubt a wise little girl because despite what everyone thinks of the mysterious Ajusshi, she can see that he is a good person underneath all the gruffness. Sigh. I wish I could have Won Bin as my best friend and mysterious neighbor!\n\nCharacter introduction is one example of how efficient and well-rounded the production team is at framing each character. Unlike a drama which has some leeway in establishing character traits and personalities, movies are limited to a finite amount of time to accomplish the same exact level of familiarity. This film, however, delivers in all categories by familiarizing the viewer with almost every character we encounter, setting up a clear love/hate relationship.\n\nWon Bin as Cha Tae-shik really should be called the “King of Expression.” There are numerous moments in the movie in which his eyes tell you more than any dialogue could. I have been a long-time fan of Won Bin so I have come to expect this amazing level of acting, but he truly did step it up. You can see the pain in his eyes, the heartache, the regret, and for those few moments, even happiness and relief. I have to say that by far Won Bin contributed most to the emotional rollercoaster that made this film so moving.\n\nKim Sae-ron as Jung So-mi is a relatively new actress whose performance was really enjoyable. I loved how quirky and cute she was. The emotional parts that she had to do, which I’m sure must be hard for any actress, let alone a child actor, were simply brilliant. She made me cry a few times, and I consider myself made of stone, so you can imagine! Sae-ron is definitely one of those child actors to be on the lookout for, because with acting abilities like hers, there is no telling what the future holds.\n\nWhat made the movie really special though was the excellent chemistry between Won Bin and Kim Sae-ron. The duo was quite eccentric, but somehow managed to be adorable at the same time. They played off of each other really well and most of all their friendship seemed natural, not at all forced. The movie would not have been the same without this pairing, and the tender/tormenting moments would not have been as emotionally charged.\n\nThe pair was honestly really cute together and I found myself wishing I had a mysterious Ajusshi neighbor that would come to my rescue! I guess dreaming of one will have to do.\n\nIn one of the most important scenes in the movie, So-mi gives Ajusshi her most prized possession: a Yu-gi-oh card called Dark Night which she says “beats everything.” She turns to leave but faces him one more time to say:\n\nSo-mi: Ajusshi! I embarrass you too, right? That’s why you ignored me? It’s okay. My teacher and all the kids at school do that, too. Mom said that if I get lost, I should forget our address and phone number. She gets drunk and says we should die. Even though that pig called me a bum… You’re meaner. But I don’t hate you. Because if I do, I won’t have anyone I like. Thinking about it hurts me here (she pounds her chest near her heart). So I won’t hate you.\n\nThis is by far one of the saddest speeches I’ve heard in a long time. She pours out her soul to him, revealing her hopeless situation. This is really one of the turning points in the movie because this is where we find out that she really needs Ajusshi. He’s important to her, and although not readily apparent, he needs her too.\n\nAside from the main characters, the secondary characters were also quite brilliant.\n\nKim Sung-oh, who plays evil drug baddie Jong-seok, was really surprising. I’ve seen him in minor roles in Secret Garden and Midas, where both times he played a silly/not-so-well-off-intellectually type of person, but his role here was drastically different. He plays an amazing sadistic evil guy, with a bit of a psychopathic edge. I like it when an actor is not a one-trick pony and delivers lots of range. He was actually one of my favorite characters just because of how demented his character was.\n\nKim Hyo-seo, as So-mi’s drug addicted and negligent mother, was probably the biggest surprise. She was incredible in the scene that displayed the horrors of drug addiction. The representation of drug world is drastically real. We see the conditions of drug abuse, the treatment of children as cattle, and even the violent and often relentless business that is drug dealing.\n\nThe movie is so good at capturing experiences/real life situations, like addiction, violence and sadness. The ecstasy on the mother’s face as soon as she injects the heroin is stunningly real and I must give proper recognition to Kim Hyo-seo for her incredible acting in the role of the drug-obsessed, negligent mother. I think I’m going to keep a closer eye on her from now on.\n\nOther notable actors included Kim Tae-hoon, who played the lead detective Kim Chi-gon, and Kim Hee-won, who played super evil drug baddie Man-seok. Tae-hoon was good at playing an all-time serious detective, but his character in all honesty did not pique my interest as much as the others. Hee-won was by far one of the most dynamic characters in the movie and really worked the angle of loathed drug tycoon really well. There was also the inclusion of funny man Lee Jong-pil, as detective Noh, and Thai actor Thanayong Wongtrakul, as a psychopath with a knife Ramrowan, who spoke perfect English.\n\nNow for the really juicy stuff: the plot and production value. At first, I thought the plot sounded mundane; super mystery man gets involved with the underground drug world leading to danger and sadness, but ultimately ends up saving the day. Man was I ever wrong. The plot itself is not contrived and is in fact well-written.\n\nThe premise is pretty classic: hero needs to save people from evil guys. But that’s where the classic nature ends. Relationships are built that give rise to the action. The dynamics of these relationships are not all black and white, and as such there is definitely an inherent struggle in the viewer. We connect to the characters in such a way that draws us into their world, and as a result we become invested.\n\nFrom the beginning, the film manages to set up the relationship between So-mi and Tae-shik, defining every aspect of this movie. And let me just say I am so glad that a romantic relationship was not the main focus for at least one movie I have seen in the last year. The production crew manages to capture the eccentric yet realistic relationship between mysterious/kind stranger and youthful/spunky misfortunate girl (if you can imagine that). This is a talent that you will see is noticeable throughout the film: the ability of the production team, as well as the actors, to capture epically realistic and emotionally charged scenes really well.\n\nThe story centers on a very mysterious Ajusshi, and we gradually learn more about him as the film progresses, and see what led him to his present state. His backstory is really kind of tragic, but that tragedy allows us to connect as viewers to his story. He might be a recluse, but he has one friend in So-mi, equally jaded, despite being such a young girl.\n\nWhat I thought was one of the most brilliant aspects of this movie was its strategic (and not overwhelming) use of action. I cannot tell you how many times I have seen a Hollywood blockbuster that simply pounds the action at you every minute and never develops its characters or storyline. Thankfully, The Man From Nowhere does not follow in their steps. Storyline and character development are first and foremost, followed by the use of action as a supporting device to further the story.\n\nFrom explosions to fight scenes and even portrayal of death, action did play a big part in the excitement factor of this movie. I will admit, had action not been involved, this movie would have been a huge melodrama cry-my-eyes-out-until-I-dehydrate parade. The action though, provided a great sense of thrill. Some of the fight scenes were some of my all-time favorites because the fighting was actually visible.\n\nFar too often cameras can’t capture the rapid movements in fight scenes, and they end up a big blurry mess of twisted bodies. But the visual acuity of the camera work really helps bring out the stunning nature of the fight scenes.\n\nThe graphic nature of the killings — an axe to the head, a knife to the mouth, even organ removal — was really well done. I truly was not expecting that. And from then on, the explicit nature of the scenes only grows. Deaths became bloody and violent, revelations even more shocking and the action sequences much more involved.\n\nThe acts of killing become really dramatic and so tangibly painful. I’m not squeamish when it comes to blood, but just thinking about the way these people died makes my skin crawl. I promise never to steal drugs for the sheer fear of how I might die!\n\nSymbols, as a plot device, are very important as well. Specifically the nail art that So-mi likes to do from the start of the film. With her mom on drugs, she turns to the only person she can, Tae-shik, and buckles down in his place for the night. When he awakens the following morning, he finds So-mi has already left, but she did not leave without a thank you gift: a painted fingernail with her special brand of nail art, which he can’t help but smile at. So cute!\n\nThe nail becomes a transient symbol throughout the movie. That one fingernail represents everything that Tae-shik is fighting for and reminds us that love, in the purest form of family love, is more important than anything.\n\nThe hair cutting scene is very symbolic and crucial to this movie’s incredible second half. This is the crux when our hero, who has been so disadvantaged for the entire movie, turns the tables. He transforms himself back into the person he used to be, releasing what I like to call the hidden beast. He’s willing to give up everything to save this little girl. I love the symbolic nature of the actions the writer-director employs because it helps the viewer understand the stages of his development.\n\nThe greatest aspect of the movie by far was the emotional side of the storyline. My heart was wrenched out of my chest, stepped on a few times, thrown across the world, and put back in my chest and bandaged with one of those cute penguin band-aids. I literally felt everything the characters felt, and for it I was an emotional wreck by the time it was over. I love a movie that can make me feel everything that a drama makes me feel, but in less than 2 hours. (I still love you, dramas!)\n\nIn terms of cinematography, this movie was definitely in a class of its own. The angles, the lighting, the scenery, and even the set design were truly marvelous. In fact, I think a big part of what made this movie great was the acuity of the camera work. At times it was clean and focused so we could see every detail within the frame, and at others, when the action was chaotic, was face moving and even dizzying, but still visible. It was the camera work that made the fighting scenes so realistic.\n\nBut I think it is safe to say that the movie itself was truly enhanced by the incredible degree of acting. Won Bin is a master at expressing emotion with his eyes. Without many words he was able to take us from melancholy to surprise, to misery, to anger, and finally to relief and happiness. Whether it was tears of sorrow or tears of contentment, I truly think the powerful facial expressions of Won Bin made the movie that much more special.\n\nThe Many Faces of Won Bin:\n\nOverall I think writer-director Lee Jeong-beom was spectacular. He had the vision and skill to execute this dream film with such finesse and artistic aptitude that it really was inspiring. I hope that we see more great works from this writer-director, preferably more action films, although other genres wouldn’t disappoint. (Imagine what he could do with a romantic comedy!)\n\nThe Man From Nowhere is a must-watch and I promise you won’t regret it.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope you liked this first movie review.

I've never seen Won Bin in anything and now I think I'm missing a great watch.\n\n(If I could get through Ninja Assassin without tossing my cookies, perhaps there's hope for this one!)\n\nOne thing I wish you had mentioned in your review was the availability of English subs and if they were fairly accurate?\n\nThanks again - great screencaps!\n\n:)\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### only1tony\n\n###### September 12, 2011 at 8:42 PM\n\nDear Cynthia,\n\nI will be sure to put in my comments section, next time, whether or not they are available in English subs and if they were a good translation.  Although for the most part movies, at least ones that have been released for more than a year, usually have subs available and are pretty good quality.  Thank you for the suggestion it was very helpful.\n\nonly1tony\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Chocobo\n\n###### September 13, 2011 at 6:31 AM\n\nThis particular movie is available on Netflix. It does seem that recently there is a slow trickle of Korean movies and shows trickling in on the Netflix website.\n\nMy related suggestion for only1tony is to perhaps develop a rating for each reviewed movie based on content, like the MPAA. Some viewers might not be interested in, or able to handle, explicit violence or sex.\n\nEven a very crude rating based on comparable movies (i.e. this was a lot like \"Taken,\" but with more blood and beatings, so it's \"R\"). Even a warning for particularly difficult scenes (i.e. \"watch out for lady-in-the-trunk-scene\") would be helpful.\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Shel\n\n###### September 13, 2011 at 8:20 AM\n\nRating would be helpful for me, too.  My 14 yr old daughter loves watching movies from all over the world with me, but there are many things that I'd rather she didn't see.  (Her adult brother took her to see \"Hanna\" when she was visiting him,  and it was bloody/gory enough that she wasn't able to sleep for several hours, and was calling me at like 1 am....so we'd like to avoid that).  Usually, if I'm concerned, I'll try and watch it first, but I rarely have time to watch a movie once, much less twice.\n\nThanks.\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### only1tony\n\n###### September 13, 2011 at 8:53 AM\n\nDear Chocobo,\n\nFirst I must tell you how amazing your screen name is.

You know how some movies just deserve to be seen on the big screen? This is one of them. It was amazing, and by the time I came out of it I was totally emotionally drained and wrung out from the experience.\n\nI've never seen Won Bin in anything but this movie (*gasp* I know!), but it's enough to make me his fan for life, because he nailed this role. With very few words he took us all over the emotional map and made us feel what Cha Tae-shik was feeling, which is rare, especially in the limited time a movie has. Likewise, Kim Sae-ron blew her role out of the water, and was perhaps more impressive for being so young. And I simply fell head over heels for the lighting and directing - they were truly masterful.\n\nThanks for sharing this review with us! I'm excited to read and hear more about kmovies from you, only1tony. I like your style. ^\\_^\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 13 Fayt890\n\n###### September 12, 2011 at 8:43 PM\n\nWell written :) Keep up the good work.

Your name reminds me of Anthony Dinozzo (NCIS) or Tony from Who Saved The Boss.\n\nI enjoy the realistic fighting style of Ajusshi too. 'Realistic' if you believe that one man could beat so many people by himself. One thing that bugs me is the characterization, or rather the cartoonization of the gangsters, in particular the clownish/cliched brothers duo. I wish they had spent more time to develop that bits.\n\nOn a girly note, I squealed when Won Bin showed up looking all dandy and sweet in his flashback scene at the hospital. Good Lord, that smile! In my eyes he is the original flower boy of K entertainment industry. The fact that he has the looks of a (younger) Brad Pitt but the ambition &amp; talent to be a Robin Williams only enhanced his allure. He was totally believable when he played the mentally chalenged man in Mother\n\nThanks for the review!\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 16 Shevie\n\n###### September 12, 2011 at 8:48 PM\n\nabsolutely loved this movie. thanks for the review\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### 17 teacup\n\n###### September 12, 2011 at 8:49 PM\n\nthank you for reviewing this movie.  I've always wondered when such awesome korean movies would be reviewed.\n\ni really like your straight forward style of writing.  no flowery language or bad jokes.  However i noticed that in movies with such depth and so many areas to cover, it's a difficult task for the writer to stay cohesive and make the essay flow in order.  I personally would consider this review as jumping around the places.  Several times in different places of the review, \"acruity of the camera\" and \"relationship between ahjusshi and the little girl\" were mentioned.  And once you've covered something, i think it's redundant to cover it repetitively unless there is another fresh perspective you want the audience to know.\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### only1tony\n\n###### September 12, 2011 at 8:52 PM\n\nDear teacup,\n\nYeah thank you for that.  I kinda thought it was choppy too but I promise to work on that.  This was kind of a mash between a recap and a review which ended up being a little bit coarse.

I watched it on instant netflix and it was pretty intense. I found it sometimes overshadowed the relationship between Tae-shik and So-mi due to the fascination of the underbelly. Not to mention it was creepily gorgous with great minor acting (I think that ajumma was one of my favorite minor characters), and awesome shots. Haha, thanks again for making me have a mini reliving of the movie!\n\nA second on adding comparisons to other movies, since general readers will find themselves doing it (It was the movie Taken for me). To get around those who could be lost, maybe make the name of the movie a link to imbd or wikipedia? Considering it might not always be needed to know the plot of another movie if you're just comparing scenes, for instance, and how they were simliar or different.\n\nMy other suggestion is consider bringing up how censorship and things like societal/gender roles are placed in the movies. Granted, feel free to talk general cinematography! Just an example would be the date rape. That really struck me for how different it was because it was there for only a couple minutes of suggestion and done. Nothing really explicit, which is interesting since other movies would've taken the extra time to hone in on that to reinforce his vileness. It can bring another layer that is pretty fascinating since it unconsciously helps shape our viewpoints of a movie.\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### only1tony\n\n###### September 12, 2011 at 9:18 PM\n\nDear Rachael,\n\nThank you for that.

You take really great choices for screen caps first off. Really ace. I think they can help with the (mentioned) above choppiness. Considering how in recaps the images let readers keep track of the general flow of the episode this can also help you while reviewing when intially getting your thoughts together. This can also keep your thoughts a little more organized and you have more freedom since you don't have to go in order for a movie review. You already have some moments where you started doing it even. Just needs to be a little more consistent in how does the image add to what you're writing and/or what do you want a reader to notice (in consideration of your text) about that (or those) particular image(s).\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nWebsite\n\nRequired fields are marked *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### jcl\n\n###### September 13, 2011 at 7:42 PM\n\nummmm, there was a date rape in Ahjushi?

The partnership of <actor>Won Bin</actor> and <actor>Kim Sae-Ron</actor> is excellent, and their chemistry as a mysterious man and the little girl who loves him is incredible.</p>\n            <p>This movie is beautifully constructed in both visual and story aspects. The sheer emotion this movie elicits is simply unspeakable: from the pain of societal rejection, to hopelessness, to unadulterated anger, and finally a sense of what it means to purely love. It is definitely a must-see.</p>\n            <p>The premise of <movieTitle>The Man From Nowhere</movieTitle> centers around a mysterious Ajusshi named <character>CHA TAE-SHIK</character> (<actor>Won Bin</actor>), who is very solitary and largely stigmatized as a societal outcast. He is befriended by his neighbor’s daughter <character>JUNG SO-MI</character> (<actor>Kim Sae-ron</actor>) who is also looked upon with disdain because of her socioeconomic status. So-mi’s mother gets involved in a complex drug ring that leads to her and her daughter’s kidnapping, and the only person who can rescue them is Tae-shik. He goes to any lengths to save the one little girl who believes in him. It is an action-packed, rollercoaster of emotions that will grab hold of you until the very end.</p>\n            <p>This movie is wonderful from a multitude of aspects that I will try my hardest to capture in this review. First and foremost, I must call attention to the extensive pool of talented actors.</p>\n            <p>We meet our hero, Tae-shik, who looks a little disheveled and very much like an outcast, but despite his appearance he still manages to show a sweet side admiring some white flowers. He arrives at his residence where we meet So-mi for the first time. She is an energetic girl, talking to Tae-shik despite his refusal to respond with little more than monosyllabic answers.</p>\n            <p>I love this duo because it’s so unexpected, but they fit each other so well. He’s so silent and solemn and she’s so energetic and youthful. They also don’t act like they have a typical adult/child relationship, but they’re more like argumentative best friends. So-mi is without a doubt a wise little girl because despite what everyone thinks of the mysterious Ajusshi, she can see that he is a good person underneath all the gruffness. Sigh. I wish I could have <actor>Won Bin</actor> as my best friend and mysterious neighbor!</p>\n            <p>Character introduction is one example of how efficient and well-rounded the production team is at framing each character. Unlike a drama which has some leeway in establishing character traits and personalities, movies are limited to a finite amount of time to accomplish the same exact level of familiarity. This film, however, delivers in all categories by familiarizing the viewer with almost every character we encounter, setting up a clear love/hate relationship.</p>\n            <p><actor>Won Bin</actor> as <character>Cha Tae-shik</character> really should be called the “King of Expression.” There are numerous moments in the movie in which his eyes tell you more than any dialogue could. I have been a long-time fan of <actor>Won Bin</actor> so I have come to expect this amazing level of acting, but he truly did step it up. You can see the pain in his eyes, the heartache, the regret, and for those few moments, even happiness and relief. I have to say that by far <actor>Won Bin</actor> contributed most to the emotional rollercoaster that made this film so moving.</p>\n            <p><actor>Kim Sae-ron</actor> as <character>Jung So-mi</character> is a relatively new actress whose performance was really enjoyable. I loved how quirky and cute she was. The emotional parts that she had to do, which I’m sure must be hard for any actress, let alone a child actor, were simply brilliant. She made me cry a few times, and I consider myself made of stone, so you can imagine! <actor>Sae-ron</actor> is definitely one of those child actors to be on the lookout for, because with acting abilities like hers, there is no telling what the future holds.</p>\n            <p>What made the movie really special though was the excellent chemistry between <actor>Won Bin</actor> and <actor>Kim Sae-ron</actor>. The duo was quite eccentric, but somehow managed to be adorable at the same time. They played off of each other really well and most of all their friendship seemed natural, not at all forced. The movie would not have been the same without this pairing, and the tender/tormenting moments would not have been as emotionally charged.</p>\n            <p>The pair was honestly really cute together and I found myself wishing I had a mysterious Ajusshi neighbor that would come to my rescue! I guess dreaming of one will have to do.</p>\n            <p>In one of the most important scenes in the movie, So-mi gives Ajusshi her most prized possession: a Yu-gi-oh card called Dark Night which she says “beats everything.” She turns to leave but faces him one more time to say:</p>\n            <p><character>So-mi</character>: Ajusshi! I embarrass you too, right? That’s why you ignored me? It’s okay. My teacher and all the kids at school do that, too. Mom said that if I get lost, I should forget our address and phone number. She gets drunk and says we should die. Even though that pig called me a bum… You’re meaner. But I don’t hate you. Because if I do, I won’t have anyone I like. Thinking about it hurts me here (she pounds her chest near her heart). So I won’t hate you.</p>\n            <p>This is by far one of the saddest speeches I’ve heard in a long time. She pours out her soul to him, revealing her hopeless situation. This is really one of the turning points in the movie because this is where we find out that she really needs Ajusshi. He’s important to her, and although not readily apparent, he needs her too.</p>\n            <p>Aside from the main characters, the secondary characters were also quite brilliant.</p>\n            <p><actor>Kim Sung-oh</actor>, who plays evil drug baddie Jong-seok, was really surprising. I’ve seen him in minor roles in Secret Garden and Midas, where both times he played a silly/not-so-well-off-intellectually type of person, but his role here was drastically different. He plays an amazing sadistic evil guy, with a bit of a psychopathic edge. I like it when an actor is not a one-trick pony and delivers lots of range. He was actually one of my favorite characters just because of how demented his character was.</p>\n            <p><actor>Kim Hyo-seo</actor>, as So-mi’s drug addicted and negligent mother, was probably the biggest surprise. She was incredible in the scene that displayed the horrors of drug addiction. The representation of drug world is drastically real. We see the conditions of drug abuse, the treatment of children as cattle, and even the violent and often relentless business that is drug dealing.</p>\n            <p>The movie is so good at capturing experiences/real life situations, like addiction, violence and sadness. The ecstasy on the mother’s face as soon as she injects the heroin is stunningly real and I must give proper recognition to <actor>Kim Hyo-seo</actor> for her incredible acting in the role of the drug-obsessed, negligent mother. I think I’m going to keep a closer eye on her from now on.</p>\n            <p>Other notable actors included <actor>Kim Tae-hoon</actor>, who played the lead detective Kim Chi-gon, and <actor>Kim Hee-won</actor>, who played super evil drug baddie Man-seok. Tae-hoon was good at playing an all-time serious detective, but his character in all honesty did not pique my interest as much as the others. Hee-won was by far one of the most dynamic characters in the movie and really worked the angle of loathed drug tycoon really well. There was also the inclusion of funny man <actor>Lee Jong-pil</actor>, as detective Noh, and Thai actor <actor>Thanayong Wongtrakul</actor>, as a psychopath with a knife Ramrowan, who spoke perfect English.</p>\n            <p>Now for the really juicy stuff: the plot and production value. At first, I thought the plot sounded mundane; super mystery man gets involved with the underground drug world leading to danger and sadness, but ultimately ends up saving the day. Man was I ever wrong. The plot itself is not contrived and is in fact well-written.</p>\n            <p>The premise is pretty classic: hero needs to save people from evil guys. But that’s where the classic nature ends. Relationships are built that give rise to the action. The dynamics of these relationships are not all black and white, and as such there is definitely an inherent struggle in the viewer. We connect to the characters in such a way that draws us into their world, and as a result we become invested.</p>\n            <p>From the beginning, the film manages to set up the relationship between So-mi and Tae-shik, defining every aspect of this movie. And let me just say I am so glad that a romantic relationship was not the main focus for at least one movie I have seen in the last year. The production crew manages to capture the eccentric yet realistic relationship between mysterious/kind stranger and youthful/spunky misfortunate girl (if you can imagine that). This is a talent that you will see is noticeable throughout the film: the ability of the production team, as well as the actors, to capture epically realistic and emotionally charged scenes really well.</p>\n            <p>The story centers on a very mysterious Ajusshi, and we gradually learn more about him as the film progresses, and see what led him to his present state. His backstory is really kind of tragic, but that tragedy allows us to connect as viewers to his story. He might be a recluse, but he has one friend in So-mi, equally jaded, despite being such a young girl.</p>\n            <p>What I thought was one of the most brilliant aspects of this movie was its strategic (and not overwhelming) use of action. I cannot tell you how many times I have seen a Hollywood blockbuster that simply pounds the action at you every minute and never develops its characters or storyline. Thankfully, <movieTitle>The Man From Nowhere</movieTitle> does not follow in their steps. Storyline and character development are first and foremost, followed by the use of action as a supporting device to further the story.</p>\n            <p>From explosions to fight scenes and even portrayal of death, action did play a big part in the excitement factor of this movie. I will admit, had action not been involved, this movie would have been a huge melodrama cry-my-eyes-out-until-I-dehydrate parade. The action though, provided a great sense of thrill. Some of the fight scenes were some of my all-time favorites because the fighting was actually visible.</p>\n            <p>Far too often cameras can’t capture the rapid movements in fight scenes, and they end up a big blurry mess of twisted bodies. But the visual acuity of the camera work really helps bring out the stunning nature of the fight scenes.</p>\n            <p>The graphic nature of the killings — an axe to the head, a knife to the mouth, even organ removal — was really well done. I truly was not expecting that. And from then on, the explicit nature of the scenes only grows. Deaths became bloody and violent, revelations even more shocking and the action sequences much more involved.</p>\n            <p>The acts of killing become really dramatic and so tangibly painful. I’m not squeamish when it comes to blood, but just thinking about the way these people died makes my skin crawl. I promise never to steal drugs for the sheer fear of how I might die!</p>\n            <p>Symbols, as a plot device, are very important as well. Specifically the nail art that So-mi likes to do from the start of the film. With her mom on drugs, she turns to the only person she can, Tae-shik, and buckles down in his place for the night. When he awakens the following morning, he finds So-mi has already left, but she did not leave without a thank you gift: a painted fingernail with her special brand of nail art, which he can’t help but smile at. So cute!</p>\n            <p>The nail becomes a transient symbol throughout the movie. That one fingernail represents everything that Tae-shik is fighting for and reminds us that love, in the purest form of family love, is more important than anything.</p>\n            <p>The hair cutting scene is very symbolic and crucial to this movie’s incredible second half. This is the crux when our hero, who has been so disadvantaged for the entire movie, turns the tables. He transforms himself back into the person he used to be, releasing what I like to call the hidden beast. He’s willing to give up everything to save this little girl. I love the symbolic nature of the actions the writer-director employs because it helps the viewer understand the stages of his development.</p>\n            <p>The greatest aspect of the movie by far was the emotional side of the storyline. My heart was wrenched out of my chest, stepped on a few times, thrown across the world, and put back in my chest and bandaged with one of those cute penguin band-aids. I literally felt everything the characters felt, and for it I was an emotional wreck by the time it was over. I love a movie that can make me feel everything that a drama makes me feel, but in less than 2 hours. (I still love you, dramas!)</p>\n            <p>In terms of cinematography, this movie was definitely in a class of its own. The angles, the lighting, the scenery, and even the set design were truly marvelous. In fact, I think a big part of what made this movie great was the acuity of the camera work. At times it was clean and focused so we could see every detail within the frame, and at others, when the action was chaotic, was face moving and even dizzying, but still visible. It was the camera work that made the fighting scenes so realistic.</p>\n            <p>But I think it is safe to say that the movie itself was truly enhanced by the incredible degree of acting. <actor>Won Bin</actor> is a master at expressing emotion with his eyes. Without many words he was able to take us from melancholy to surprise, to misery, to anger, and finally to relief and happiness. Whether it was tears of sorrow or tears of contentment, I truly think the powerful facial expressions of <actor>Won Bin</actor> made the movie that much more special.</p>\n            <p>Overall I think writer-director <actor>Lee Jeong-beom</actor> was spectacular. He had the vision and skill to execute this dream film with such finesse and artistic aptitude that it really was inspiring. I hope that we see more great works from this writer-director, preferably more action films, although other genres wouldn’t disappoint. (Imagine what he could do with a romantic comedy!)</p>\n            <p><movieTitle>The Man From Nowhere</movieTitle> is a must-watch and I promise you won’t regret it.</p>\n        </content>\n    </review>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to include the required XML tags based on the attributes specified in the ADT.

            "content": "- Home\n- Meet the Bloggers\n- Editor’s Notes\n- Jet Fuel Review\n\n# JFR Blog\n\n##\n\n## Who Is The Real Monster?: An Analysis of “I Saw The Devil”\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1EdnTdI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDriven by powerful performances in both the protagonist and antagonist roles — and bolstered by the equally as memorable cinematography and a beautiful score — Korean director Jee-Woon Kim’s 2010 horror/thriller masterpiece, I Saw The Devil, is perhaps one of the scariest films of the 21st century.\n\nI Saw The Devil isn’t necessarily a horror movie in the traditional sense. It’s not trying to get you with jump scares, there are no ghosts or monsters or undead creatures, nor is its sole purpose to be a gore-fest with no interesting, discernible characters or memorable meaning to it not unlike some recent horror series.\n\nI Saw The Devil is more closely related to films like Gone Girl or Se7en than it is the horror staples like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween. I Saw The Devil is, in the most basic of terms, a murder mystery. All of that being said, I Saw The Devil is still one of the most effective horror movies to come out in recent years.\n\nI Saw The Devil starts with a hell of an opening that effectively sets the stage for what’s to come in the following two hours. The first character we are introduced to, a 20-to-30-year-old woman named Joo-yun, is brutally murdered within the first ten minutes, with most of the murder shown on-screen. From here on out, the elongated sequences of murder and torture that occur become grislier and harder to watch. The special effects work that was put forth in this movie for the gore is flawlessly executed, and some of the most realistic effects work to date in the horror genre.\n\nEarlier, I compared I Saw The Devil to fellow standouts of the murder-mystery subgenre of horror, Gone Girl and Se7en, but where I Saw The Devil stands out is in the fact that the audience is aware of who the killer is from the first scene. This allows for the director to show us scenes from the killer’s viewpoint, and this clues us in on how the killer reacts to his acts of violence, and gives us insight into how his mind works. Though the killer is a realistic portrayal of a murderer and is, in the end, just a regular human being, he ends up being much scarier than the supernatural silver screen killers Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. It’s the idea that a man like this could actually exist that sends shivers down my spine.\n\nSPOILERS FOR I SAW THE DEVIL AHEAD\n\nThe killer in question is Kyung-chul, played spectacularly by a terrifyingly merciless Choi Min-sik (whom you may be aware of for his main role in 2003’s Oldboy, among other things). Though Kyung-chul is the co-main character of this story, you will feel no sympathy for him. Usually you would expect some sort of arc for a character — perhaps a revelatory moment that makes him more human than monster, thus making us feel sympathetic for him — but not with Kyung-chul.\n\nWhen he’s at his most fearful, and even begging for his own life to be spared, I still couldn’t feel remorse for a character that enacted such brutal, senseless murders beforehand. You begin to feel excited that he might die, and it’s amazing that the filmmakers were able to impart this merciless feeling on the viewer, because it’s almost like we are enacting our own revenge for the brutality we were exposed to because of him.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1MdtW6l\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI Saw The Devil is a beautiful film that is trapped in an ugly story. The direction, cinematography, score — it’s all fantastic. Along with cinematographer Lee Mo-gae, Kim has crafted a marvelously visual film that he shoots with much elegance and craft.\n\nFor a horror film, I Saw The Devil has some truly interesting and exciting fight scenes that are expertly choreographed and shot in a way where we see all of the action. In a time where many action movies are shot at such breakneck speeds that result in the viewer hardly being able to tell what’s going on on-screen, I have to give props to Jee-woon Kim for making these scenes easily comprehensive.\n\nIt’s worth noting, too, that not that many movies have orchestral scores that really make me recognize how good they are, but I Saw The Devil is definitely one of those movies. The score that’s crafted fits the mood of every scene perfectly, and it even enhances the overall effect of the film.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1H7TeMF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe reason why I Saw The Devil is so scary is not only because of the actions of its characters, but also due to how realistic the movie is. It may be even more frightening that the “heroic” protagonist of the story, Soo-hyun (the husband of the woman murdered in the opening scene), played elegantly by a reserved Lee Byung-hun, goes to the lengths he does to exact his revenge. Instead of just offing the killer when he has the chance — not even an hour into the film’s running time — Soo-hyun goes to great lengths to release him, only to hunt him over and over again, almost making the act of revenge into some demented game.\n\nThe trauma that Soo-hyun faces upon the news of his wife’s death quickly pulls him over the edge to become a deranged sociopath of his own. It’s very sad watching him degrade himself to this point. You feel awful for him in the beginning. But in the end, it’s almost sort of hard to feel so bad for Soo-hyun. After all, it’s because he didn’t stop Kyung-chul when he first had the chance to (or the second or the third time) that Kyung-chul is able to outwit him and subsequently murder countless others along the way.\n\nLike I mentioned before, the realism of the events that occur in the movie really makes it stand out as a truly terrifying movie. “Modern horror” differentiated itself from “classical horror” by bringing the horrific events happening on-screen into the “here and now,” but unlike most horror flicks, I Saw The Devil feels like something that can actually happen in real life (and unfortunately does happen), and from there it even differentiates itself from most modern classics of the horror genre.\n\nThere’s no Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees who simply won’t die for good here. In I Saw The Devil, we have just some really sick people who have no sympathy for the lives of others. These people exist in our world, and that is why I Saw The Devil is, at it’s core, such an effective horror movie that will stick with you for a long time to come.\n\n— Michael Lane, Blog Editor\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Tweet\n- Reddit\n- Share on Tumblr\n\n### Related\n\n### 3 thoughts on “Who Is The Real Monster?: An Analysis of “I Saw The Devil””\n\n- Pingback: Editor’s Notes #161 | The Jet Fuel Review Blog\n- Pingback: 13 Netflix Horror Films for Halloween – Part 2 of 2 | The Jet Fuel Review Blog\n- Kotagiri ganesh September 9, 2020 / 2:28 pm\n\n\nYour wrong there are jump scares in this movie, opening when she turns on headlight he suddenly appears etc and a few\n\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a comment Cancel reply\n\nΔ\n\n### Like us on Facebook!\n\n### Subscribe to our blog!\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\nEmail Address:\n\nSign me up!\n\nJoin 1,643 other subscribers\n\n### Search the Site\n\n### Features: Film/Television\n\n- Christian's Cinematic Syntax\n- Dennis's Customs of Cinema\n- Goranson's Greenlight\n- Harper’s Character Selection Screen\n- Kat's Catalog\n- Kayla's Moody Mystery Chamber\n- Michael Lane's Down a Dark Lane\n- Nick’s Horror Flick Picks\n- Patiño’s Lores and Myths in Film\n- Spangler's From Sentence to Screen\n\n### Features: Literature\n\n- Andrea's Musings of a Future Librarian\n- Author Interviews\n- Cat's Cozy Corner\n- Día Con Miguel\n- Journals You Might Like\n- Kasia's The Canon—Close Encounters\n- Liam's Comic Craze\n- Not Your Binary: A QTPOC Reading Column\n- Pick-a-Poem\n- Poems from Slate\n- Words an' Pictures\n\n### Features: Music\n\n- Dan Fiorio's Basement Dwelling\n- Haley's Poetic Playlist\n- Jason's Metal Library\n- Jet Fuel Jukebox\n- Lauren's Etude to Eden\n- Noah Slowik's Between Rock and an Indie Place\n- Putting Tracks on the Map with Trish\n- Raimbaults Got Rhythm\n\n### Features: Special\n\n- Alumni Features\n- Faculty Features\n- Meet the Authors\n- Meet the Bloggers\n- Meet the Editors\n- Student Features\n\n### Features: Variety\n\n- Author &amp;amp; Artist Interviews\n- Community Discussion\n- Dan &amp;amp; Mike's Infinite Canvas Podcast\n- Mary's Fun for Nerds\n- McFerron's Authors of Revolution\n\n### Features: Writing\n\n- Garcia's Guide to BIPOC Authors\n- Logging Lives with Lydia\n- Mary's Editor's Notebook\n- Mary's Wednesday Prompts\n- Mary's Writing Advice\n\n### Literary Journals We Like\n\n- Arsenic Lobster\n- Jet Fuel Review\n- Kettle Blue Review\n- Poetry\n- Requited\n- RHINO\n- The Account\n- Tupelo Quarterly\n- Vinyl\n\n### Related Blogs &amp; Sites\n\n- Creative Writing Prompts\n- Duotrope's Digest\n- NewPages\n- storyfix\n- The Poetry Foundation\n- Writer Unboxed\n- Writing Excuses Podcast\n\n### The Archives\n\n- Antonio's The Rare Review: A Look at Sci-Fi/Drama\n- Ashna’s Celluloid Scenes: Women in Pop Culture\n- Bittke's The Atlas Outlaw\n- Bree's Melancholic Tales\n- Britt’s Anime and Gaming Adventures\n- Capperino’s Romantic Inquiries\n- Casual Critics: Donatas Ruzys\n- Casual Critics: Reno Stramaglia\n- Christine's Movie Macabre\n- Complexities with Khuffash\n- Deirdre's Obscure Punctuation\n- Deirdre's Science in Writing\n- Dom's Before They Were Famous\n- Dom's Shakespeare Blog\n- Hannah's House of Horrors\n- Henrietta Eghan's Words for the Mind and Soul\n- Holm's Mindfulness Mentor\n- Jake Johnson's Colors of Noise\n- Jakob’s From Fact to Film\n- Jess' Literary Heroine Spotlight\n- Jessica's Phobias\n- Justin Fortes' Fear Needs No Translation\n- Kelly's Book Bucket List\n- Lauren's Books on Screen\n- Lauren's Fictional Friday\n- Levi's Lessons in Evil\n- Linda's Ekphrastic Blog\n- Linda's Sunday Serial\n- Linda's Writing Challenge\n- Linda's Writing Excuses\n- Liz's News of the Books\n- Lucas' Bibliophilia\n- Lucas' Film Corner\n- Mark's Awesome Words\n- Mark's Nerdy Notes\n- Mary's Awesome Lit Things\n- Meg's Book Nook\n- Melissa's Thursday Three\n- Michael Cotter's What Are You Watching?\n- Michael Egan's Film Blog: Depth of Field\n- Miguel Gonzalez's Film Blog: The Wilhelm Scream\n- Mike's Malan's Horror Blog\n- Music as Poetry\n- Peck's Programming a Narrative\n- Sabrina's Book Corner\n- Selena's She/Her\n- Steve's Posts\n- Steven's Science in Cinema\n- Stride for Stride with Smrcka\n- Sylvia's Psychological Summaries\n- Tim's Storydome\n- Tonya's Prompt Wednesdays\n- Yana's Palme d'Or\n\n### Site Meta Links\n\n- Register\n- Log in\n- Entries feed\n- Comments feed\n- WordPress.com\n\n- Comment\n- Reblog\n- Subscribe Subscribed\n    - JFR Blog\n    - Join 154 other subscribers\n    - Already have a WordPress.com account?

It’s not trying to get you with jump scares, there are no ghosts or monsters or undead creatures, nor is its sole purpose to be a gore-fest with no interesting, discernible characters or memorable meaning to it not unlike some recent horror series.\n\n        <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is more closely related to films like Gone Girl or Se7en than it is to the horror staples like A Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween. <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is, in the most basic of terms, a murder mystery. All of that being said, <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is still one of the most effective horror movies to come out in recent years.\n\n        <name>I Saw The Devil</name> starts with a hell of an opening that effectively sets the stage for what’s to come in the following two hours. The first character we are introduced to, a 20-to-30-year-old woman named Joo-yun, is brutally murdered within the first ten minutes, with most of the murder shown on-screen. From here on out, the elongated sequences of murder and torture that occur become grislier and harder to watch. The special effects work that was put forth in this movie for the gore is flawlessly executed, and some of the most realistic effects work to date in the horror genre.\n\n        Earlier, I compared <name>I Saw The Devil</name> to fellow standouts of the murder-mystery subgenre of horror, Gone Girl and Se7en, but where <name>I Saw The Devil</name> stands out is in the fact that the audience is aware of who the killer is from the first scene. This allows for the director to show us scenes from the killer’s viewpoint, and this clues us in on how the killer reacts to his acts of violence, and gives us insight into how his mind works. Though the killer is a realistic portrayal of a murderer and is, in the end, just a regular human being, he ends up being much scarier than the supernatural silver screen killers Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. It’s the idea that a man like this could actually exist that sends shivers down my spine.\n\n        <spoilers> \n        The killer in question is Kyung-chul, played spectacularly by a terrifyingly merciless Choi Min-sik (whom you may be aware of for his main role in 2003’s Oldboy, among other things). Though Kyung-chul is the co-main character of this story, you will feel no sympathy for him. Usually, you would expect some sort of arc for a character — perhaps a revelatory moment that makes him more human than monster, thus making us feel sympathetic for him — but not with Kyung-chul.\n\n        When he’s at his most fearful, and even begging for his own life to be spared, I still couldn’t feel remorse for a character that enacted such brutal, senseless murders beforehand. You begin to feel excited that he might die, and it’s amazing that the filmmakers were able to impart this merciless feeling on the viewer, because it’s almost like we are enacting our own revenge for the brutality we were exposed to because of him.\n        </spoilers>\n\n        <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is a beautiful film that is trapped in an ugly story. The direction, cinematography, score — it’s all fantastic. Along with cinematographer Lee Mo-gae, Kim has crafted a marvelously visual film that he shoots with much elegance and craft.\n\n        For a horror film, <name>I Saw The Devil</name> has some truly interesting and exciting fight scenes that are expertly choreographed and shot in a way where we see all of the action. In a time where many action movies are shot at such breakneck speeds that result in the viewer hardly being able to tell what’s going on on-screen, I have to give props to Jee-woon Kim for making these scenes easily comprehensible.\n\n        It’s worth noting, too, that not that many movies have orchestral scores that really make me recognize how good they are, but <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is definitely one of those movies. The score that’s crafted fits the mood of every scene perfectly, and it even enhances the overall effect of the film.\n\n        The reason why <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is so scary is not only because of the actions of its characters, but also due to how realistic the movie is. It may be even more frightening that the “heroic” protagonist of the story, Soo-hyun (the husband of the woman murdered in the opening scene), played elegantly by a reserved Lee Byung-hun, goes to the lengths he does to exact his revenge. Instead of just offing the killer when he has the chance — not even an hour into the film’s running time — Soo-hyun goes to great lengths to release him, only to hunt him over and over again, almost making the act of revenge into some demented game.\n\n        The trauma that Soo-hyun faces upon the news of his wife’s death quickly pulls him over the edge to become a deranged sociopath of his own. It’s very sad watching him degrade himself to this point. You feel awful for him in the beginning. But in the end, it’s almost sort of hard to feel so bad for Soo-hyun. After all, it’s because he didn’t stop Kyung-chul when he first had the chance to (or the second or the third time) that Kyung-chul is able to outwit him and subsequently murder countless others along the way.\n\n        Like I mentioned before, the realism of the events that occur in the movie really makes it stand out as a truly terrifying movie. “Modern horror” differentiated itself from “classical horror” by bringing the horrific events happening on-screen into the “here and now,” but unlike most horror flicks, <name>I Saw The Devil</name> feels like something that can actually happen in real life (and unfortunately does happen), and from there it even differentiates itself from most modern classics of the horror genre.\n\n        There’s no Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees who simply won’t die for good here. In <name>I Saw The Devil</name>, we have just some really sick people who have no sympathy for the lives of others. These people exist in our world, and that is why <name>I Saw The Devil</name> is, at its core, such an effective horror movie that will stick with you for a long time to come.\n    </content>\n    \n    <author>Michael Lane</author>\n    <editor>Blog Editor</editor>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have wrapped the relevant segments with the appropriate XML tags based on the attributes defined in the ADT.

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbout\n\nPhotography\n\nArchive\n\n# Film Review: The Host (2006)\n\nBong Joon Ho, the filmmaker behind such indelible films as Memories of Murder (2003) and Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), has finished the script to his sequel to 2019’s Parasite. To satiate yourself till then, you should pick up his instant classic from 2006, The Host, released on Blu-ray, which was transferred beautifully and comes packaged with a variety of special features. But before I go more in-depth about the disc itself, I'll first say a few things about the film, which I adore.\n\n## The Film\n\nThere probably isn’t much to say about this one that hasn’t already been said in terms of perfunctory compliments (the film has been lauded with critical and academic praise), but I will say that, as expressed by the American mortician in the first scene of the film (“Let’s try to be broad-minded about this\"), in “broad” terms, The Host manages to deliver on several levels, giving more \"bang for the buck\" than most set-piece heavy genre films. It is peculiarly Korean, yet universal; it is spectacular, as well as emotionally moving; it is smart, yet not pretentious; complex, but not convoluted. In short, the film gains its vigor by delivering on three fronts: intellectually, generically, and emotionally.\n\nThe Host respects its audience and nothing appears to be sacrificed for appeal to a lowest common denominator. During its theatrical run in the United States, it was screening mostly at art houses—thus one could call it an art-house blockbuster, purely in terms of what Walter Benjamin called \"exhibition value.\" I had seen the film at a cinematheque and liked it, but rewatching it again on Blu-ray was a revelation. I had the strong impression that its statements are so pervasively layered that it would take multiple viewings from several critical perspectives to begin to unlock the depth of its aspirations. Some might call the filmmakers elitist for this very reason, but I can think of no better canon of artistry than whether a film rewards an educated audience and with multiple viewings.\n\nIn terms of genre, it has been argued—according to Joon-ho Bong—that The Host is \"Korea's first legitimate anti-American film\" because the monster can be read as an analogue of the effects of American foreign policy. Or perhaps because, more definitely, the monster is created by occupying American forces: the creature is the egregious result of an American military mortician capriciously ordering his Korean subordinate to pour gallons of formaldehyde into the sewers connected to the Han River. But a finalized reading of the monster-as-United States is an oversimplification and ignores the film's finer points. The creature can be better identified as any \"Other\"—e.g., the invisible \"system\" oppressing the individual, outsiders (e.g., American occupying forces), an incompetent family member, the notion of a deadly \"virus\" being perpetuated by the media, the homeless stealing from the rich and giving to the poor; or more precisely, any entity which is identified to be parasitical on a host, i.e., Korean national identity. To put it another way, the film is decidedly Korean, and thus not-American, but it invites being viewed from a variety of frameworks, rather than a singular \"anti-American\" one. In this sense, the film is a spiritual descendent of such horror classics as Alien and Night of the Living Dead.\n\nMoreover, while the film is rooted in the monster-movie genre from the first frame to the last, it obtains a humanity and emotional force—too often lost when character is subjugated to spectacle in genre pictures—by being constructed around the institution of the family, which, to hearken back to the film's social and political aspirations, can also be read as a microcosm for the Korean nation as a whole. Here, the Spielbergian narrative influence, from JAWS in particular, is easily recognized and most pointedly described by Steven Spielberg as \"ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\nI think this a great film and its success is due to the fact that it isn't just a \"monster movie.\" But don't take my word for it. Check it out and decide for yourself!\n\n## THE BLU-RAY: VISUALS\n\nAs I said above, the transfer on this Blu-ray is beautiful. Great texture and even some noticeable film grain in light areas. The film has a subdued color palette, mostly cold or neutral colors, but when the bright colors (e.g., red, yellow) are present, they are extremely vibrant and I suspect that red and yellow are intended by the filmmakers to serve a symbolic or thematic purpose. The film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in glorious 1080P and although the high resolution reveals the imperfections of the CGI creature in certain shots, this doesn't detract from the film at all because, in my view, the \"monster\" always has quotes around it.\n\n## THE BLU-RAY: AUDIO\n\nThe disc offers the original language track, in lossless 5.1 PCM, as well as DTS-HD and Dolby Digital. Also available is the English dub, which I think is adequate if you're just looking for a fun story, but it mistranslates and omits parts of the English subtitle track that I considered integral to understanding some of the film's subtext. Try to avoid the English dub if you can.\n\n## THE BLU-RAY: SPECIAL FEATURES\n\nThere is some filler on the disc as far as special features go, but if you're interested in visual and practical effects I'd recommend watching the \"Designing the Creature\" and \"Puppet Animatronix\" featurettes. Also noteworthy is the English audio commentary track which is basically a dialogue between director Bong Joon-ho and his friend Tony Rayns, whom you may know as a frequent commentary track contributor on DVD and Blu-ray releases from Criterion Collection and Masters of Cinema. All of the special features are in standard definition.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nIf you are a fan of the movie, this disc is a must-have, almost entirely because of the quality of the transfer and the commentary track. It’s always nice to hear what the filmmakers have to say about their work. I also recommend picking this up if you haven't seen it but liked Joon-Ho’s other films. For collectors, however, I must point out that this disc is missing a substantial amount of supplemental material found on the R1 2-disc Collector’s Edition DVD.\n\n#### Blu-ray Stills (Courtesy of DVDBeaver.com)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMean State is a creative production company based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPrevious\n\nPrevious\n\n## DaVinci Resolve to After Effects Workflow\n\nNext\n\nNext\n\n## Film Review: Let the Right One In (2008)\n\nLOCATION: Charlotte, North Carolina +1 415-612-8496\n\nlandon@meanstate.com",

Here, the Spielbergian narrative influence, from <title>JAWS</title> in particular, is easily recognized and most pointedly described by Steven Spielberg as \"ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.\"</p>\n\n            <p>I think this a great film and its success is due to the fact that it isn't just a \"monster movie.\" But don't take my word for it. Check it out and decide for yourself!</p>\n        </filmAnalysis>\n\n        <bluRayReview>\n            <visuals>\n                <p>As I said above, the transfer on this Blu-ray is beautiful. Great texture and even some noticeable film grain in light areas. The film has a subdued color palette, mostly cold or neutral colors, but when the bright colors (e.g., red, yellow) are present, they are extremely vibrant and I suspect that red and yellow are intended by the filmmakers to serve a symbolic or thematic purpose. The film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in glorious 1080P and although the high resolution reveals the imperfections of the CGI creature in certain shots, this doesn't detract from the film at all because, in my view, the \"monster\" always has quotes around it.</p>\n            </visuals>\n\n            <audio>\n                <p>The disc offers the original language track, in lossless 5.1 PCM, as well as DTS-HD and Dolby Digital. Also available is the English dub, which I think is adequate if you're just looking for a fun story, but it mistranslates and omits parts of the English subtitle track that I considered integral to understanding some of the film's subtext. Try to avoid the English dub if you can.</p>\n            </audio>\n\n            <specialFeatures>\n                <p>There is some filler on the disc as far as special features go, but if you're interested in visual and practical effects I'd recommend watching the \"Designing the Creature\" and \"Puppet Animatronix\" featurettes. Also noteworthy is the English audio commentary track which is basically a dialogue between director Bong Joon-ho and his friend Tony Rayns, whom you may know as a frequent commentary track contributor on DVD and Blu-ray releases from Criterion Collection and Masters of Cinema. All of the special features are in standard definition.</p>\n            </specialFeatures>\n        </bluRayReview>\n\n        <conclusion>\n            <p>If you are a fan of the movie, this disc is a must-have, almost entirely because of the quality of the transfer and the commentary track. It’s always nice to hear what the filmmakers have to say about their work. I also recommend picking this up if you haven't seen it but liked Joon-Ho’s other films. For collectors, however, I must point out that this disc is missing a substantial amount of supplemental material found on the R1 2-disc Collector’s Edition DVD.</p>\n        </conclusion>\n    </filmReview>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have structured the content to enhance readability while ensuring that the relevant attributes from the ADT are tagged appropriately.

Another member puts the film down for its sentimentality. I don't know about that: When a country has been as divided as has Korea for the past half-century, a movie like this must have really knocked the socks off of a lot of South Koreans (I doubt it could be shown in the North). I'm trying to think of some equivalently themed American film, but nothing comes to mind. \"A Midnight Clear\"--or a film about comradeship on either side of, say, America's Civil War-- just couldn't provide the sense of long-term division/separation that Korea has experienced. Beautifully filmed, with flashbacks and varied points-of-view, this puzzle movie eventually comes together, offering some of its best moments toward the end. The last shot is astonishing: simple and reminiscent, but now seen with enough clarity and irony to open mouths and overflow tear ducts.\n\n- talltale-1\n- Sep 26, 2004\n- Permalink\n\n### Peace Is Preserved Hiding the Truth  A Touching Antiwar Movie\n\nAfter a shootout at the common security area at the border of the two Koreas, when two soldiers were murdered, Maj. Sophie E. Jean (Yeong-ae Lee) is assigned by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate the incident. The smart Major finds lack of consistency in the statements of the survivors, and in spite of being pressed by her superior, she interviews South Koreans Sgt. Lee Soo-hyeok (Byung-hun Lee) and private Nam Sung-shik (Tae-woo Kim), and the North Korean Sgt. Oh Kyeong-pil (Kang-ho Song), disclosing a tragic story of friendship. In the end, peace and Sgt. Oh are preserved hiding the truth in her report.\n\n\"Gongdong Gyeongbi Guyeok JSA\" is a magnificent and touching antiwar movie. Directed by Chan-wook Park, the director of the cult \"Oldboy\", only now this film was released in Brazil, after the success of \"Oldboy\". This movie has a fantastic screenplay that keeps the interest in the impressive story until the very last scene. I was moved with the sad story of friendship between brothers in this polemic theme. The Common Security Area, created on 27 July 1953 with the armistice between the two Koreas after three years of war, and their reunification, seem to be a taboo for these peoples and I appreciate the courage of this group of excellent actors and actress in approaching such theme. In the Extras of the DVD, the cast and director give interviews about the story but never give their opinion about the reunification of these nations. The stunning cinematography and camera work are also very beautiful. My vote is nine.\n\nYitle (Brazil): \"Zona de Risco\" (\"Zone of Risk\")\n\n- claudio\\_carvalho\n- Dec 23, 2006\n- Permalink\n\n### Excellent Korean drama from Old Boy director\n\nAfter a general moratorium on film exports, JSA was amongst the first few Korean films to appear in west, to be associated with the emerging Korean 'New Wave' cinema. It was also one of the most successful and expensive films made in the country at the time, and as such was director Chan-Wook Park's breakthrough film. Park has since gone on to direct such cult items as Oldboy, in which he combines a sure sense of staging with a visual, kinetic flamboyance all of his own. A compelling and moving work in its own right, JSA makes something haunting and memorable out of a situation which, in outline, could easily have proved propagandist and dull.\n\nIt takes place entirely at the Panmunjom, the Korea DMZ peace village where North and South Koreans face off under the terms of 50-year-old treaty, glaring at each other across a thin stretch of ground, huddled over spyglasses and rifle barrels, or staring each other down across a borderline. The bitter division of the country provides a frequent background to much of its cinema just as, in its way, the spectre of past nuclear destruction has haunted that of the Japanese. But there is a difference. Japanese cinema often shows the dangerous unity of clan, kin or country in the face of crisis. In Korean cinema, brothers are often divided whilst, around them, a fractured society threatens and fights itself. Sometimes the violent resolution of the country's famous stand off promises mutually assured destruction, as is presented symbolically at the climax of Attack The Gas Station! (1999). In other films it can appear as part of an action thriller (Shiri), or as the basis of a recent war film (Taegukgi, 2004), and so on. In the more profound JSA, national division provides a starting point for an examination of the human condition, as soldiers on either side of the line discover what it is to establish warm, normal interaction - even at terrible cost.\n\n\"There are two kinds of people in this world - Commie bastards and the Commie bastards' enemies\" says a South Korean officer to the Swiss investigator Major Sophie Jean (Yeong-ae Lee) at the start of Park's film. Jean works for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Previously her superior has warned her that her real job is not to investigate, \"who, but why,\" and that \"the outcome is less important than the procedure.\" But as Jean delves deeper into recent events with an insistence born of her own family history, revelations prove Rashmon-like, proving that the truth is by no means black and white. In fact the opening scenes, containing the harsh protocols for her work, are the least satisfying of the film. (A fact exacerbated by the poor spoken English of actress Lee and the woodenness of her Swedish companion). It is only once the viewer enters the experience of the soldiers - a process gradually revealed through a number of sometimes-gnomic flashbacks - that JSA becomes interesting.\n\nJSA was a controversial success in Korea. The action is set very precisely, at the borderline between two societies and Park was concerned to make it as realistic as possible, spending $1 million on building his own Panmunjom. As a narrative his film is just as deliberately less exact, hovering between military thriller, patriotic tragedy, personal loyalty tale as we learn more about the soldiers, now tight-lipped under independent interrogation. Enemies, then friends, comrades and brothers, the men's deepening relationship also suggests a more taboo attraction, one which proved unsettling to home audiences. Ultimately the 'Joint Security Area' becomes less a site of military stalemate than a place where emotional ties ought to provide their own justification and balance.\n\nThe structure of Park's film is an intriguing one: a straightforward, and reasonably suspenseful investigation of an outrage frames a sequence of flashbacks and reminiscences, often presented in non-linear manner, fleshing out the main story. In between there is some newsreel footage as well as some exploration of Major Jean's motivations, while the feelings of the soldiers concerned are never elucidated, merely explored through past events. The director's achievement lies in tying all this into a reasonably convincing whole, moving the audience from the coldness of a military tribunal to the warm realm of human feeling.\n\nThere are several moments in JSA to savour, some of which occur within the no man's land between the two societies itself - a neutrality which seems to encourage a self reflection and recognition between main participants: the snowy, wordless encounter between two border patrols for instance, where tension is dissipated with a single cigarette; or the first encounter on a cold night between Sergeant Oh and Sergeant Lee, surrounded by mines, their breath freezing in an field. Elsewhere Park's camera records the absurdities of petty border etiquette, at one point shooting from overhead the dividing line where soldiers square off against one another, placing figures in some lunatic grid of their own devising. (At one point Park has two of the soldiers mock the solemnity and rigidity of the border by playing spitting games across the line.) There's a similar overhead shot later, this time looking down at a fallen soldier face up in the rain. The camera also plays a memorable part in the last scene of the film, as an ordinary snapshot is transversed by a slow pan, which pulls out of the composition a final, mute commentary of its own.\n\nAsked earlier why one of the soldiers had deserted his post just to relieve himself, the blithe answer comes back as: \"People with constipation should seize the chance when it comes.\" It's a philosophy that informs a good deal of JSA. Not to put too fine a point on it, the film suggests that, blocked by its own political impasse, Korea needs to loosen up and seek relief as it can. Park's film shows one way, perhaps not the best, but a memorable story all the same.\n\n- FilmFlaneur\n- Jul 29, 2005\n- Permalink\n\n### Surprisingly Moving Piece of Korean Cinema\n\nFusing a Hollywood-style 'who-dunnit' with an intellectually poignant essay on Korean geopolitics, 'Joint Security Area' ('JSA') offered a surprisingly moving twist to an otherwise engaging film. \n\nIt raises questions on the incredulity of ideological differences. It showcased the ridiculous, yet tragic consequences such an imposed barrier can have on its people. People, whom if not separated by mere political allegiance, have more in common than they care to admit. 'JSA' perceptively explored a modern day Korean psyche - that heartfelt desire for kinship and unity between the people of both Koreas.\n\n'Joint Security Area' is a timely film with a universal message - \"Let not differences in race, religion or ideological allegiance blindside our judgement, especially in these violent and confusing times.\"\n\n\nI instinctively respond to this message. I hope you do as well.\n\n- Sinnerman\n- Oct 10, 2001\n- Permalink\n\n### A truly inspiring movie that makes you ask \"Why do we have wars?\"\n\nI must admit when i first saw the cover of this movie my initial thoughts were \"oh man another pointless testosterone military driven movie\", how wrong i was.\n\nThis is a wonderfully crafted masterpiece that evokes the strongest emotions in a person's heart. The movie is set in Korea and portrays how different people can set asides their differences and be able to see each other in the purest form, that we are the same, brothers and sisters.\n\nI found myself on a roller coaster ride of emotions, laughing one minute, in with tears in another. All the actors and actress have done a superb job in this one. The most emotionally powerful scene was the last scene. Only a photograph but conveys so much meaning and emotions.\n\nDefinitely a must watch movie, no matter what nationality you are, you will be enchanted and inspired by this movie's magic, and understand a bit more about what it means to be a person.\n\n- jinly\\_\n- Sep 29, 2005\n- Permalink\n\n### Film about the futility of enmity, and the gift of true friendship\n\nThe Korean peninsula is divided like no other. The two countries are still fighting in a sense the cold war, divided by loyalty to different creeds. Not an easy subject to tackle, but this film takes the subject and smooths off the edges to show us that there is hope and beauty underneath.\n\nThe film centres round an investigation over a border-side killing. Unbeknown to the investigators, intertwined into their investigation is a friendship that had developed, behind the back of their superiors, of two sets of border guards on either side of a bridge dividing the countries. The secret friendship seems to concentrate the whole Korean divide issue simply, but minor hostility still pops its head up now and again, nevertheless without needing any kind of over-dramatics the men all respect and begin to ultimately care for each ahead of all else As expected, the whole situation comes to a head, and their is some strong emotional moments but the education to anyone who watches this more than makes up for all else.\n\nI can't think of many more emotive subjects or films that I have seen this year. The acting and direction is perfect, whilst the script is funny and emotional. Korean films are just so far ahead of all else, it just defies belief. Highly recommended, you can't go wrong with this gem of a movie.\n\n- joebloggscity\n- Aug 20, 2006\n- Permalink\n\n### Well done!\n\n- nr3685\n- Jun 29, 2004\n- Permalink\n\n### Chan-wook Park's most politically-charged film tackles the very volatile tension that exists between the North and South Koreans.\n\nChan-wook Park's most politically-charged film tackles the very volatile tension that exists between the North and South Koreans. This could have easily been propagandistic in nature, with this South Korean film portraying the Northerners as mere caricatures of Communistic ideals, but instead the film happily sidesteps this and portrays both the North Koreans and South Koreans as kinsmen.\n\nIn the beginning of the picture, both sides have a skewed view of one another, seeing each through the lens of their political temperament - the border between the two thus is interpreted as a wall that filters and jades each one's perspective. However, once that that wall is finally crossed, the two sides realize that no wall really exists, and they begin to see each other as human beings - The soldiers first call one another \"enemies\", but soon they are calling one another \"brothers\".\n\nThe characters are richly drawn and dynamic to reflect this - each are humans, with their own unique demeanor, and that their national identity is nothing more than a facade. While the soldiers are alone, away from their government infrastructures, both sides cling to one another in fellowship as they find themselves all the same. Only when the absent governmental element is reintroduced are the soldiers forced to revert back behind their facades, and tragedy results.\n\nA powerfully moving and keenly intelligent analysis of the confusing political situation between the two opposing governmental systems. Despite being slightly marred by a few lapses into melodrama and overstatement, that can not take away from its piercing effectiveness.\n\nThe highest recommendation possible.\n\n- Schwenkstar\n- Feb 28, 2008\n- Permalink\n\n### Brothers Disarmed...\n\nHands across the void, separated by dogma, briefly reunited, candid, without melodrama. A gulf simply straddled, a divide quickly filled, no malice or distrust, as partnerships re-build.\n\nLeaders seldom lead, people following the bread, on all sides there's mistrust, of what's been spoken and what's been read. Continually replayed, along friction points that burn, when constructs are embellished from pontificating churn.\n\nIf only others didn't get in the way, what a great place the world could be, every day, after day, after day.\n\n- Xstal\n- Jan 21, 2022\n- Permalink\n\n### Best Korean movie ever\n\nAlthough a native Korean, I've always been skeptical of Korean movies. They tend to overplay emotions and lack realism.  Well, this movie changed my whole outlook - it is a grippingly realistic movie that rips through the storyline.  I was spellbound. Set in the highly charged Korean demilitarized zone, it is the tale of a shootout gone wrong, but the movie is much more than just a whodunit.  It illustrates quite subtly the delicate North-South emotions that transcends ideologies of the 2 regimes; it really is about characters and their situations, rather than actions.  The film also features some beautiful cinematography - the scenes I remember are the tall grass (the minefield incident) and the muted cigarette exchange on top of a snow-covered hill. The latter, particularly, is extremely poignant in its silence.  Why are they smoking together?  And why do they not speak?  The answers to these questions, I guess, are the subjects and emotions that the movie tries to convey. The only flaw I can offer is the clear mis-casting of Lee Young-Ae as the neutral major, but her role in the movie is not central enough (although she does take up quite an amount of air time) to drag down the whole movie. IMHO, I would have used a Korean-European new face in the role. I am sure that it appeals to Koreans more than foreigners, although i'm also sure you can enjoy it without prior knowledge.  I recommend this very highly.  It's a pity that it's still not out on DVD even after 1 year following its release, and I hope it is released soon so that movie lovers everywhere can appreciate it.\n\n- Iljun\n- Oct 19, 2001\n- Permalink\n\n### Very good, when the dialog is in Korean\n\nI saw this as the second half of a double bill and after the first five minutes of truly horrible english dialog I thought I was in for a rather lame movie going experience, but i was too be proven wrong.\n\nJSA is quite a good film, especially when it is looking back on the friendship of the North &amp; South Korean border guards.  Anytime the film went to english dialog, the film took a turn for the worse.\n\nViolent in parts, funny in others, a great human story set in the DMZ, a place not renowned for it's humanity.\n\n- mighty\\_pickman\n- Jan 12, 2004\n- Permalink\n\n### AWESOME PIECE OF WORK:  Rent this today if you can!\n\nIt's been a few years, but I saw this in a Singapore theatre a day or two after it opened there. A Korean friend had mentioned it was good, so I went to check it out assuming it would be good. OH MY GOSH! This was an excellent movie and it seems so unfortunate that it didn't get a wide-release in North American (or not that I know of) as I think it would have done really well! This was #1 in Korea beating out Spider Man!! In fact, the North Korean leader even requested a copy for his viewing pleasure -- perhaps to get his own look at what South Korea might be plotting, or maybe simply to be entertained with some great film-making.\n\nThe movie combines a very likable Hollywood touch with compelling plot action, in contrast to some very personal moments and an amazing sense of suspense in this movie. I was floored.\n\nThe whole location of where the movie takes place -- in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea -- and the acute tension was certainly captured and sure made for great story-telling. I can't remember another movie where I saw and experienced more tension in a story than in this movie! It fit the story perfectly, and really got the movie off to a great start. Then, as the characters were introduced, piece by piece, we explored action, emotion, and thought. The movie examined, re-examined and really brought us close not only to the events, but to the people in the story. I felt a range of emotions in this story culminating in a really great movie!\n\nThis is a must-see!\n\n- Jamester\n- Sep 22, 2005\n- Permalink\n\n### A film every Korean has probably seen, and every other person should see to understand the country\n\n- smakawhat\n- Oct 19, 2002\n- Permalink\n\n### Not bad\n\nBeing a huge fan of Parks \"Oldboy\" i bought this movie and was quite disappointed (in comparison), but it is difficult to say where exactly the flaws were. The plot is not without interesting twists and the movie avoids most clichés that you await in your standard military-research movie. But especially the female-lead character is far too weak elaborated. I had difficulties to follow the motivation of all the characters (especially the soldiers), and the cast was permanently overacting. As Park mentioned in an interview \"between the lines\": this project was mainly intended to hit the box-office so that he could get his next work (\"Oldboy\") financed, and being the most successful south-Korean movie of all times we have to admit that this goal was achieved. But it is far from the emotional impact that a movie like \"No man's land\" had on me, who has a quite similar subject. (5/10)\n\n- moviezmaniamaster\n- Jan 1, 2006\n- Permalink\n\n### One of the most touching movies I've seen\n\nJSA is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. The story is really something to ponder in the modern day society. People that are forced to take sides because of national interests meet and find out that they are not that different at all.\n\nThe characters are clearly defined with great depth, the way it's filmed is just awesome and the story is an important lesson to us all. \n\nIf you walk out of the theater after watching this movie without being deeply moved, you probably don't have any feelings at all.\n\nChan-wook is a master and with this film he confirms his place on the throne.\n\n- feel-1\n- Aug 12, 2006\n- Permalink\n\n### JSA is a beautifully executed and highly intelligent piece of cinema\n\n\"Joint Security Area\" (2000) is directed and co-written by Park Chan-wook and is plainly put, brilliant cinema.\n\nThe convoluted plot is intelligently edited and paced and as a result, the film is greatly entertaining. The way Park Chan-wook uses the camera is bar none amazing; he truly has a great director's eye for cinematography.\n\nThe production design of the border between the Koreas. The performances from leading roles. It all adds up to an emotional crescendo as a stroke of genius from a masterful director.

And the movie sticks till the end on this \"political sobriety\" with the exception of some divergences. And just on account of the absence of a structured anticommunism, the movie gets quite convincing, while the development of the main characters and the script itself are remarkable.\n\nHowever, the film appears to suffer from historical imprecision and ideological disorientation, since: 1. The division of Korea with all the tragic consequences for the Korean people is somehow presented as result of the political struggle between capitalism and communism. But this is only the half \"truth\".\n\nThe truth is that after the end of WWII, the allies (USA, Soviet Union and Britain) committed themselves that \"the two zones of military responsibility (in Korea) should be unified as fast as possible in order to form a united and independent state. However, the intentions of the United States and the reactionary circles of Korea were different. Their objective was the socio-political control of the whole country, something that wasn't an easy task for them, since the Korean People's Movement was powerful, and so were the revolutionary forces themselves. Under these conditions, it was obvious that a unified Korean state could not satisfy the interests of the domestic reactionary circles and American imperialism. Thus, despite the international agreements and the will of the Korean people, in August 1948 they established a puppet regime in the southern part of the country with head Lee Seung-Man (Syngman Rhee) that was named \"Republic of Korea\". These developments compelled the progressive forces of the Korean people to respond with the founding of a proportionate type of formation in the north. One month later, in September 1948, Democratic People's Republic of Korea was founded.\"\n\n2. The viewer is emotionally loaded as the movie underlines the necessity of reunification, but it never puts the question: \"what kind of reunification shall it be\". And this constitutes a pitfall for the unsuspected viewer. What shall be the political direction of the resulting new state? Because any reunification process has to lead to a definite economic, social and political status. It cannot be neither apolitical, nor neutral, nor completely independent from any ideology. Today there is a lot of experience on the issue of \"reunification\", and an excellent example is the reunification of Germany and its consequences. What do the Germans who were living in the Socialist East Germany, the German Democratic Republic (DDR), what do they say today about the capitalistic reunification of the two Germanies that took place on 1990? What happened afterwards? What is happening the last years to the social and labour rights of the workers of the former DDR and West Germany? The answer is given in a relatively recent poll of the German political magazine \"Der Spiegel\". (Majority of Eastern Germans Feel Life Better under Communism).\n\nConsequently, it is undoubtedly sure that a reunification in a capitalistic social-economic direction will lead, on one hand to the constant deterioration of workers' life in North and South Korea, and on the other hand on the rise of the profitability and the possibilities of exploitation for the south Korean and foreign bourgeoisie. That's why it is not adequate to talk about reunification without determining the political direction of the reunification. Concluding, the struggle for reunification of the Korean Working people of South and North is inevitably coincided with their common anti-imperialist struggle and the struggle for a Socialist Korea.\n\n3. The movie is covering up the huge and dominating military presence of the USA in the DMZ, obscuring the \"bonds of blood\" between the South Korean bourgeoisie and American imperialism.\n\n- kosta-vidali\n- Apr 28, 2011\n- Permalink\n\n### Couldn't care less\n\nI watched this because it was made by the old boy from Old Boy. I had also recently seen Memories of Murder and thought I was on a winning streak of enjoyable Korean movies.\n\nStrike three - I'm out.\n\nI can see what they were trying to do, and the story is familiar of people from opposite sides making bonds that break.\n\nMy main problem is that I found that I couldn't care less about any of the characters. The acting ranged from fair to appalling. The female non-Korean Korean inspector was probably the worst.\n\nThe story was nothing magical and there are no surprises for anyone over the age of 21 as all of the elements have been done before.\n\nI suppose I was also disappointed after hearing so many good reviews - my expectations were set so high they had further to fall.\n\nMy advice is that if you enjoyed the other movies I mentioned, and Olboy more so than memories, then save yourself and move on to another choice.\n\n- mformoviesandmore\n- Aug 6, 2012\n- Permalink\n\n### More from this title\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I’m not scared to say that it’s also a dreadful fun-house of subverted expectations.

Scott Rigby and Richard M. Ryan in the Handbook of Media Use and Well-Being, are plots that entail fundamental conflicts which cause tension and whose resolution is in doubt. Tragic conflicts are between extrinsic goals for power or wealth and intrinsic moral or prosocial pursuits.\n\n“In tragic narratives, there is a desire to achieve a specific goal that is often pursued as a non-autonomous or obsessive passion.”\n\nAnd, of course, Tragedies almost always result in the downfall of our lead protagonists, usually just as they acquired or are about the acquire what they always wanted. And many tragedies, like Oedipus Rex, feature relatable and underdog protagonists who commit some terrible crime without realizing the depth of what they’re doing. As the protagonist realizes their error their world and accomplishments crumble around them. Through hubris, they realize they overstretched themselves and crash, like Icarus, back down to Earth.\n\nWe see these themes played out perfectly by the Kim family. They find incredible opportunities to fulfill goals for wealth, dignity, respect, and status.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThey’re willing to overlook some moral codes and even forsake compassionate attitudes to maintain what they’ve accumulated. And like a true Tragedy written by Sophocles or Euripedes these characters still remain highly relatable. No matter what they do, knowingly or unknowingly, we want them to succeed – we want them to stay safe and get a happy ending.  And so, regardless of what crimes our protagonists commit we’re enraged, horrified, overcome with pity or terror when we see their demise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to Aristotle, this was the purpose of Tragedy. He argued that tragedies receive so much attention and acclaim because they purge us of our petty concerns and worries and we can experience the cathartic release of pity and fear. Since ancient times many scholars maintain that tragic theatre has served therapeutic, cathartic functions like this.\n\nI’ll explore why we love tragedies and what makes them psychologically helpful to us, but first, let’s figure out what caused their tragedy. What was the fatal flaw that led to the Kims’ downfall?\n\n## The Cause of the Tragedy\n\nA typical reading might say that the Kims experienced their tragedy because they were either too greedy or they were pushed into desperation by the rich Park family.\n\nThis is a heated debate, actually. One that I was too shy to enter till now. Many people read the film as a narrative about the evils of a detached, un-empathetic, greedy upper class –  but, to me, this doesn’t really make complete sense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI’ve tried the reading of the villainous rich family that pressured the Kims into their moral ambiguity and downfall but it never sat well with me since the worst crime I could pin on the Parks was snobbery and cold manners while the moral infringements the Kims committed stacked relatively higher.\n\nThe Kims hurt several people to get what they wanted and even contemplated or accidentally committed murder.\n\nOf course, we don’t know what the Parks did to get rich – its never explained – who knows if Mr. Park was somehow hurting people with his job or hurt people to climb the ladder, or maybe he, like many wealthy people in real life, simply had wealthy parents-  but there was never investigation into whether Mr. Park earned his wealth morally or not. There’s nothing else in the story that shows any of the Parks being anything but oblivious and sometimes rude.\n\nSo, unfortunately, I couldn’t join those who blamed the rich for the tragedy of the Kims. Although, absolutely, the lack of social infrastructure and welfare programs to bridge inequality and provide resources to the disadvantaged is a key factor in the Kims’ lives and the snobbery they experienced from the rich definitely aggravated their condition. And it can be argued that the main lesson we should take from Parasite would be an urgent plea to bridge opportunity gaps and invest and social welfare programs that would combat food or shelter insecurities. But, again, my analyses always look at the psychological and emotional lessons we can take from a story and classic Tragedies also focus the individual’s actions instead of creating social commentaries.\n\nSo, what individual microcosmic events or perspectives led to the Kims’ tragedies?\n\nThe cause of the tragedy, the acute condition that plagued all the characters, poor or rich, and the force that motivated the final crimes of the film was something called Status Anxiety – and it lives silently gnawing away in almost all of us.\n\n## What is Status Anxiety?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus Anxiety is a term coined by philosopher Alain de Botton. Its one of his most helpful insights.\n\nStatus Anxiety is the anxiety concerned with our status in society: how we’re seen, judged, and valued based on our occupation, wealth, or how many nice things we own.\n\nIt’s that panic we experience when someone asks us, “So what do you do?“, and we suddenly feel self-conscious that our answer won’t persuade the person asking us to understand just how worthwhile and valuable we are as a person because we’re not a high level executive with a complicated title. Its the all-motivating fear that we don’t have a high enough status to earn dignity or respect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus Anxiety makes It feels like a tall order to hope that the person who asks us what we do for a living should still be interested in us as a friend or even as a human being if we say we fold pizza boxes or, god forbid, that we’re unemployed.\n\nStatus anxiety runs deep in highly individualistic meritocratic societies where our worth is routinely measured by the status of our jobs, our wealth, our possessions, our style, and our reputation with others of high status.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf you struggle with Status Anxiety you might recognize some of these behaviors in yourself:\n\n- When you have to explain your job you get nervous they will think less of you because of it. You sometimes might also subconsciously think less of someone else because of their job.\n- You’re scared that if people know how little money you make or have they’ll judge you.\n- You routinely buy as many status symbol items like new cars or accessories because the idea of others seeing you with those items is comforting – it helps you feel like you could be accepted and respected by others. Not staying up to date with your accessories might even be a source of stress.\n- You sometimes lie awake at night scared of how little you have on your resume or how few accomplishments you have compared to others on social media.\n- You might even put yourself down and think badly about yourself because of a lack of high status.\n\nA few misconceptions to avoid:\n\n- This is not a commentary on South Korean society or culture. I am not an expert in the social norms or culture of South Korea, but Status Anxiety is found all over the world – just particularity in societies that value high levels of individualistic competition or presents itself as a meritocratic society with social mobility that is “earned” through hard work. As an American, Status Anxiety manifests itself in my society in a way that seems very familiar to what I saw in Parasite. And that’s all I can speak to.\n- Status Anxiety isn’t about materialism or greed, I am not interested in demonizing those who struggle with this anxiety – I have had my battles with it as well. This form of anxiety is easy to look down on as being shallow or greedy, but its actually the poignant fear of not being seen, understood, respected, or treated with kindness the way any human should be simply because you have not “earned” enough status to unlock those heavily guarded privileges from others or, even deeper, to unlock that kindness and respect from yourself for yourself.\n- Status Anxiety is not simply a tool of oppression from the rich onto the poor. The anxiety around status does play in the favor of the rich- however, the rich are not the only ones who enforce these boundaries of status. We all have done our part. We have all learned from those older than us to judge others on their job and their income or wealth or collection of status symbols. In conversation, we probably have joked about certain professions or speak with more respect about someone with a complicated job title. \n\nBut before we feel guilty about this, we also need to recognize that we often police ourselves the most about what we think we deserve and what we don’t deserve based on how successful we feel we are compared to others. We keep ourselves from our internal wells of self-respect or self-compassion if we feel we haven’t earned those feelings. \n\nAdditionally, we were taught these ideas from a young age and have not been made aware of them regularly, awareness is the first step towards releasing ourselves from these expectations and releasing expectations we put on others for them to prove their worth to us.\n\nAll in all, Status anxiety is wholly unhelpful not only because it can steal decades of our life as we compete in a rat race for more wealth and resources in exchange for status to exchange for dignity, but because it pits us against ourselves and each other.\n\nIn a world obsessed with status, there is only one “right” way to live and that is to have high status, but its impossible for everyone to have high status because then there would be no one beneath them to compare themselves to.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn meritocratic societies the rich are quietly assumed to be more important, impressive, and worthy of our admiration, respect, and kindness – anyone who thinks otherwise is assumed to just be jealous or bitter. In these same societies, those who are poor are usually seen as lazy or unintelligent and must’ve, in some way, “chosen to become poor.” This feeds the narrative that the underprivileged deserve to be ignored, disrespected, and partitioned from the rich because their very existence is a shortcoming.\n\nBut, thinking about this, we know, on some level, this isn’t right, fair, or logical. Someone, no matter how smart, hard-working, or kind they are will always have to be on the bottom for this system to work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a side note this ties in very well with the main themes of Bong Joon Ho’s Snowpiercer and its allegory about social stratification and how inequality serves a purpose in placing everyone with a specific “function” to feed those above them. But I’d like to focus on Parasite for now.\n\nThese ideas are so well-ingrained in our minds its hard to find the roots of how deeply they reach. Even after learning about this concept we might not be aware of just how detrimental this kind of anxiety is on our sense of self-worth or mental well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI argue that Parasite is a tragedy because it is a portrait of just how malignant and destructive status anxiety can be.\n\n## All the Characters Suffer From Status Anxiety\n\nAll the characters in this film are living and breathing status anxiety.This film is an exploration on how status anxiety is upheld by imaginary lines, rules, and the rationing of dignity and respect.\n\n## Status Anxiety for those in Lower Status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### The Kim Family\n\nFirst, looking at the Kims, they are the most obvious victims of Status Anxiety. More than anyone else in the film, this family knows the sorrows of being seen as lesser than. As the film progresses we witness a bitterness grow in the Kims.\n\nAfter being confronted with the lines and boundaries enforced by the rich they struggle to reconcile how they’re seen and treated because of their low status and the knowledge that they deserve more dignity and comfort.\n\nHowever, the Kims were the perfect protagonists because they subvert many expectations that Status anxiety instills in us. They are not living in low status in a subterranean apartment because they are “dumb” or “lazy”.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe opening scenes establish right away that although the Kims are dealing with shelter and food insecurity – they are intelligent, cunning, and work very hard to attain even basic necessities.They are doing the best they can with the few resources they have. We see through them that they don’t choose poverty – they are unlucky, unsupported, and marginalized. Those in impoverished conditions are usually made invisible by status anxiety in real life – those who observe status rules have learned to ignore real-life Kims or think harshly of them and their lifestyle  – but by making a family like the Kims our main characters in a film like this – they are brought out of the obscurity they’re usually kept in in real life and quickly become sympathetic underdogs that everyone wants to root for.\n\nThis is a good moment of mindfulness for ourselves as the audience- we can check with ourselves about how much respect and dignity we ascribe to families like the Kims in real life. Recognizing the complexity of the lives of those who people are usually taught to ignore or belittle is a good step in the direction of breaking our status anxious lens.\n\n## Kim Ki-Woo (Kevin)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKi Woo is our central figure for the Kim family and he is the one who sparks their tragic journey – he is, in a way, patient zero of the rampant status anxiety that plagues the Kim family in the second half of the film.\n\nIn the beginning, his family had seemed more or less concerned with simply surviving their day to day life. They would celebrate their small victories, and appreciate what they did have. But this all starts to change when Min gifts them the viewing stone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn that moment, Ki Taek seems happy for the kind gift, and Ki Woo’s mother, Chung Sook, is more concerned with practicalities over ideas of status and would’ve preferred food. But the stone becomes a source of inspiration and obsession about status and social mobility for Ki Woo.\n\nAs a young and clever man watching his peers grow into great opportunities, he is preoccupied with attaining high status, by any means necessary. Ki Woo enjoys the fineries of the Park’s home and his new income and he does climb to higher status with his eyes set on marrying into the Park family as a way of taking the elevator up the social ladder –  but towards the end of the film, we see what truly haunts him.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen faced with the decision to either cut his losses and run or solidify his ascension in status – he takes a moment to think about what he really wants.\n\nIt’s not the house, not a rich wife – those aren’t the things that motivate his decision to attempt murder – it was this moment, when he considered whether he could ever fit in with these shiny, comfortable, happy families. That is, after all, what is at the end of our status anxiety – our concerns that we are being left out or overlooked. Our concern that a lack in status means we’re less deserving of comfort, happiness, or community.\n\nNow I want to rewind a moment to this scene:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is the scene where Ki Woo confronts a drunk man relieving himself next to their home. Its a scene that confused me on my first watch – I had wondered why it was included. Sure it was a moment of levity and silliness, but I wasn’t sure what it was contributing to the movie as a whole. It didn’t make sense until I applied my analysis of status anxiety to the film.\n\nI don’t think its a coincidence that Ki Woo’s first choice of weapon (before his father gives him a water bottle, instead) to ward off the disrespect and humiliation of having your home peed on is the viewing stone. It also isn’t a coincidence that at the start of the film Ki Woo had been ridiculed for not having the same vigor as his wealthy friend to scare the drunk man away from relieving himself on their home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis second scene is halfway through the film and after getting into the Parks good graces, Ki Woo insists on fighting back now. In a way this moment symbolizes Ki Woo’s growing confidence that his imminent ascent in social status earns him the right to enforce respect from others in a way he or his family hadn’t asserted before because he and they finally “deserve” better.\n\nWhile I’m not one to defend the attack of even a rude drunk man with a bludgeoning object I argue that Ki Woo’s Status Anxiety is what made him ever believe he had to wait until he accumulated more status before allowing himself the confidence or self-worth to assert boundaries and even basic respect from others.\n\n## Kim Ki-Taek\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKi-Taek is another vehicle for status anxiety and how it eats away at our sense of identity and self-worth. The symbol of status anxiety in his journey was smell. Bong Joon Ho used smell as a symbol since its something that would realistically be noticeable when these two families meet. Throughout the film the smell of characters becomes a signifier of their status. The poor smell strangely and the rich have no mentionable scent – they are simply the normative, the default, the expected.\n\nThe device of smell being connected to status is very realistic. Anyone who has struggled with housing or utility insecurity would understand the high anxiety around being seen and judged as unclean when interacting with more privileged people. To smell bad or different is shameful and usually seen as a personal fault – one becomes repellent and an object of disgust, no longer a fellow human but an imposition. This motif also come to a peak in the final scenes of the film.\n\n## Chung Sook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor Chung Sook, I just want to focus on one specific moment during the night of the storm for Chung Sook that changed the fate of every character in the film. Arguably, it was the first domino to fall to spark the rising conflicts of the conclusion, and I argue it was pushed by status anxiety.\n\nIt was noted by some essayists that a sharp departure in message from Bong Joon Ho’s Snowpeircer is that the disadvantaged in Parasite don’t share a sense of camaraderie. In Snowpeircer, those from the back cars work together to move forward. Here, it plays out differently, when they’re discovered, Moon Gwang – the previous housekeeper -tries to relate to Chung Sook. Saying, “we’re not so different.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChung Sook might have seen the similarities and understood that they really aren’t very different in their struggles and deceptions. Yes, living under the house was particularly strange, but after all they both had been lying to the Parks in significant ways to pull themselves out of poor living conditions and if we were watching closely we’d remember that the shop mentioned in this scene that had gone bankrupt and put Guen Sae and Gwang Moon in debt, landing them in this position hiding from loan sharks, was the same shop that Ki Taek used to work for. This detail further highlights their similarities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBut, in this moment, Chung Sook is angered by the comparison. Instead of helping, she doubles down and antagozes Moon Gwang by threatening to callt he cops. Moments later, Chung Sook is at Moon Gwang’s mercy when its discovered the Kims’ situation is discovered. Moon Gwang takes advantage of this and the rising conflicts start.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a way, I feel this scene highlights how Status Anxiety is a highly competitive and individualistic feeling. Paradoxically, those in lower status who are anxious about their status can be some of the  harshest critics of those who are most similar to themselves. They can be so preoccupied with the game of status mobility that they won’t mind competing with others like them and climbing over them – in fact, by climbing over others and putting them down – the anxious further assert their ascension in the ranks of status. Those who are trying to climb the ladder can look down at those they left behind in the competition as a means of building self-esteem. That’s why Moon Gwang’s momentary comparison that they are similar was so insulting to Chung Sook.\n\nThis anger and game of comparison further perpetuates and fortifies the hold of status anxiety on us not only as an individual but as a society – when competition and “winning” is prized over camaraderie or collaboration.\n\n## Moon Gwang and Guen Se\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEven the previous housekeeper and her husband are fueled by Status Anxiety – however they are the opposite from the Kims. Where the Kims have become angry at the Parks and the boundaries between them, these two have bought into the illusion of status completely.\n\nInstead of anger, they, especially the husband, truly believe that the Parks must be nearly divine for having maintained such power and wealth. The husband exalts and worships the patriarch of the Park family like a religious figure – he is dizzy with love and gratitude for his unknowing benefactor.\n\nGeun Se is a great symbol of those who idolize status to the point they no longer question the status quo and are willing to give their time, energy, and love to reinforce these ideals. He might be a stand in for people who idolize the wealthy zealously, thinking about them constantly, rationalizing income disparity, while never being appreciated or even seen by those they put on pedestals.\n\n## Status Anxiety in those of High Status\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe rich in real life, like the Parks, enjoy all the many benefits of high status, they have access to many resources, comforts, and limitless dignity. They live in a world of overflowing light and space.  All of the social niceties that the poor are denied, the rich collect in surplus. People are extra patient, extra kind, extra generous with those of high status.\n\nBut even the rich aren’t exempt from a few negative effects from status anxiety. The Kims constantly describe the Parks as nice, naive, and simple. These are both virtues and weaknesses. With so many social and physical resources insulating them from the outside world, they can afford to be blind to the struggles of those who work around them to build them up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI’d make a brief argument here that films like Parasite are useful for those of higher status to watch so that they can have a window into the lives of others with less status and to understand just how tall their ivory towers are.\n\nThe unpopular opinion I’m bringing to this analysis is that, while the Parks are a part of unempathetic and inequitable system, they aren’t malicious. They’re uneducated in the struggles of those beneath them – they are so detached from the rest of society that they are self-obsessed and easily overwhelmed by slight discomforts all while being oblivious to the deep-rooted pain and suffering of others outside their ivory tower.  The narrative of Status Anxiety has taught them that they earned their resources, they’ve earned a surplus of respect, dignity, and admiration and should use them as much as possible, and shouldn’t need to worry about anyone with less because all it takes is hard work and anyone could have what they do (even though this is not entirely true.)\n\nThe worst crime I can contribute to the Parks is that, Status Anxiety in the wealthy manifests as highly conservative and defensive views. They are pressured internally to not only maintain but elevate their image with expensive tastes and the best education. The rich need to reinforce boundaries in society that keep themselves on a higher rung and others beneath them.\n\nSo, as we see in the movie, One of their priorities when interacting with those they perceive as below them on the status ladder is maintaining the line between them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is said explicitly by Mr. Park many times – he praises chauffeurs who can stay behind a status line and help reinforce the strata that affords the Parks so much comfort. Any time anything crosses the line, it upsets or angers Mr. Park quietly.\n\nMr. Park’s reaction after Ki Taek asks him, “You still love her, right?” after Mr. Park shared his wife’s flaws.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile the Parks don’t need to worry about resources or food or shelter insecurities – they worry about maintaining and gardening the status quo – their home, their clothes, the accomplishments of their children. They draw lines and focus on small details like smells as a means of buying into the illusion of status that serves them very well, but it is still one of their own primary causes of anxiety. Those in lower status look at their concerns and what they spend their resources on as lavish, excessive, and maybe a bit ridiculous but these purchases come from a place of status anxiety, too.\n\nAnother layer of how the Parks related to those of lower status creeps up during the night of the storm. It becomes clear that they also fetishize those in lower status. When Mr. Park finds what he thinks are cheap underwear in the car he sniffs them, and although he’s seemingly repulsed, we learn later it becomes a fantasy of his.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe fantasy probably centers around how the imaginary woman who would own cheap underwear and have sex in a backseat must be someone wild and doesn’t care about protecting her reputation or status. They desire what they think are the carefree and unrestrained lives of those beneath them. It seems like a fantasy of the wealthy to be as “reckless” as the people who don’t have to mind rules, images, and boundaries the way they do in their high status.\n\nThis whole exchange is incredibly humiliating for the Kims to hear and probably degrading to witness how the Parks fetishize those beneath them, this further aggravates an obsession with status for the Kims.\n\nSo while the Parks reinforce status anxiety and keep up boundaries, the Parks are just as tangled in the web of status anxiety as the other characters in this stories, though they suffer much less and do, both knowingly and obliviously, contribute to the symbolic oppression of those beneath them, again, the worst crime they commit is snobbery. Their worst crime is simply reinforcing status anxiety in others – but I argue that’s something that almost everyone in a status anxious society is trained to do from childhood, regardless of how wealthy you are.\n\n## The Breaking Point\n\nThe beginning of the end is when the Kim family’s home is flooded. Their dreams of ascent are dashed by the reality of their condition – their helplessness in living in a subterranean home in a part of the city lacking the infrastructure needed to stop floods. What little comforts and possessions they had are jeopardized.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat Ki Woo finds in his flooded home is the viewing stone again. It seems to bubble up to the surface although it must be very heavy. Its the only thing Ki Woo cares about and finding it in this condition, without its base and among the remains of his home, seems to aggravate something inside him. The stone is a symbol of his obsession with status – finding it while at one of his lowest points in the story tells us exactly how his character is changing. Instead of focusing on the imminent danger of himself, his family, or what to do to get through the night – Ki Woo becomes fixated on protecting their chance for social mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHe clings onto the stone all night, talking about it with his father. The next day, we learn what plans had been hatching from Ki Woo’s desperation and trauma.\n\nWe get one more insight into Ki Woo’s mind before the final confrontations. He talks to the Park daughter about the party guests, all rich in status, style, and dignity. Even after attaining so much and having plans to marry into the Park family one day – when he asks the daughter whether or not he belongs with them we see his true fear— not that he isn’t rich or comfortable, but that he might never attain the dignity, respect, and inclusion he covets from the wealthy. I would say that this desire for the intangible and social benefits of status was what spurred him on the entire film – not material wealth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen Ki Woo takes the viewing stone downstairs instead of using any other blunt object around him, it’s of course a symbolic choice of weapon. It’s presumed he went downstairs with the stone to silence Moon Gwang and Guen Se, who were being held captive in the basement during the party. The object that symbolizes his obsession with status became his tool to dehumanize and destroy others for his own gain. Ultimately, in a tragic turn, it actually is used by a man “beneath” him to inflict brain damage on him and rob him of some of his cognitive and emotional talents, talents he had hoped to use to ascend the ranks of society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt this same time, Ki-Taek, on the other hand – is coming to his own realizations. Up till the day of the party, he had been trying his hardest to humanize the Parks throughout the film by asking personal questions, commenting on their relationships, and trying to conceptualize them not as snobby rich people or deities, but as people similar to himself and his family.\n\nIn this scene with Mr. Park, he crosses a line by mentioning how much Mr. Park must love his wife. Mr. Park had been visibly bothered the first time Ki Taek tried to cross this line.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMr. Park puts his foot down and clearly reinforces what he has only mentioned in private – the boundaries between them.  Kim is reminded that he’s just an employee, he is getting paid for this, so there’s no room for any other kind of connection. This is the moment where Kim’s efforts to try and understand the Parks falls apart – he’s left with the degradation and dehumanization that had been piling up since meeting the family.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEverything moves very quickly once Geun-se attacks.\n\nI think Bong Joon Ho used the Guen-sae to instigate the climax of the film to relieve both Mr. Kim and Mr. Park from the responsibility of spurring the bloody and tragic ending. Because of the violence and confusion, these two men collided as humans, and in the traumatic frenzy, tensions that had been brewing the entire film reached a boiling point.\n\nJessica is stabbed and Mr. Park’s son faints from the shock and begins to seize. The two patriarchs are tending to their families but Mr. Park demands Mr. Kim’s attention for his own son and without glancing at Jessica.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough Mr. Park doesn’t know Ki Taek is also trying to save his own child, the fact that Ki Taek is still expected to respect his employer’s demands to release his daughter’s wound, which needs constant pressure, to retrieve the keys shows Ki Taek something important.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHe follows orders out of habit, releasing his daughter’s wounds, and its clear that even in that moment Mr. Park’s status affords him more resources and attention that will save his son but will cost his daughter life-saving attention.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd as Guen-se lies there, still adoring Mr. Park, Mr. Park is so disgusted by the man’s smell he has to plug his nose. Ki Taek looks at this in disbelief. Of course, its strange that this moment would bother Ki Taek – after all Guen Sae had just stabbed his daughter, who in that position would care whether Mr. Park found Guen Sae disgusting?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn my interpretation, in that moment, Ki Taek was driven to a breaking point by witnessing how high and low status was being acknowledged and enforced even during a moment of raw human terror. People were dying and, still, Mr. Park was the most important person in all their minds – what he wanted and disliked was paramount.\n\nKi Taek suddenly turned the knife of Mr. Park because he was a symbol of how the  dignity, respect, and safety that Ki Taek and others with low status needed so desperately had been taken away from them so that a man with high status like Mr. Park could have more.\n\nIn the end, all the emotional violence in this film was instigated by the deep anxiety and frustration around status its grip on access to human dignity – both status and dignity are treated as nonrenewable and rare resources that only the rich deserve and dole out leaving people on the lower rungs trapped in a position to be loathed or ignored by those above them, those around them, and even themselves.\n\nThe Kims and Parks did what they did because characters in tragedies aren’t supposed to make better decisions, instead they’re supposed to fail so that we learn something. So… I’d like to use my analysis of the film to present a solution for our own woes with Status Anxiety.\n\n## How Do Tragedies Help Us?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTragedies offers us important learning opportunities and emotional experiences..  In the essay Meaningful Entertainment in an Introduction to Positive Media Psychology, you’ll find some corrective language that explains although tragedies are so popular we don’t necessarily psychologically “enjoy” tragedies, we don’t enjoy them like our other media, instead we “appreciate” them. This distinction is important because although we don’t feel happy from watching Parasite, we don’t have the positive feelings of “enjoying” it, it received so much attention because we “appreciated” how deeply it made us feel and think. Enjoyment is short-lived, but Appreciation responses to media are characterized by the audience feeling motivated to participate in self-reflection, self-development,  relationship reflection, and personal growth. In short – we like Tragedies because they help us discover who we are.\n\nIn the language of Positive Media Literacy, this means tragedies are useful tools for self-development. Our daily lives are most likely very tame, if tragic circumstances are brewing, we’re often blind or numb to them until its too late – watching a film like Parasite, beautiful, mesmerizing, and painful, can wake us up to considering in what ways we are directing our lives towards similarly unhelpful destinations and what emotional revelations we might need to pursue in order to prevent meeting similar conflicts.\n\n## What Can We Learn?\n\nSo I’d like to make all of this useful for us in real life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the conclusion, we see Ki Woo mourn his lost life from before. Rewatching the film you see that even in the subterranean home they shared in the beginning, there was vibrancy and comfort that is lost by the end. What little they had in each other is gone. Ki Woo wishes again to become rich, but now his fantasy isn’t to use money to accumulate status but to simply be reunited with his father. With this ending, our attention is directed  to what Ki Woo has learned from his tragedy. He recognizes that on his way to attain status, he lost what was truly important to him.\n\nWe don’t know if Ki Woo will achieve his goals, the director has hinted that he won’t – reminding us that for all the time and obsession we give to social mobility it really is very difficult if not impossible to attain.\n\nThe answer to status anxiety is not to simply accept our place on our rung and keep our heads down – but to practice the radical acceptance of our intrinsic, unshakeable worth as a human being outside of what we do, earn, or our style. Instead of running ourselves ragged in the rat race, always scheming to make and do more until we collapse with exhaustion or disillusionment, we can instead treat the root of our anxiety and work to remove ourselves from the narrative of Status Anxiety entirely. Removing ourselves from this unfair narrative will not only help us leave the rat race but can strengthen our sense of community and connection with others since we no longer feel like we’re competing with them to get to the top.  Status anxiety can’t be solved by becoming rich, like the Parks – we’d just make new problems and goals for ourselves and worse become blind to those around us or actively try to keep them quarantined from us.\n\nIt takes practice, maybe years of mindfulness, to rewrite our perceptions of money, fame, careers, and status objects.  Little by little, with reminders like the one we see in Parasite, we can remind ourselves that our bank accounts are not a faithful indicator of character. Having lots of money or fame is nice, if we have it it doesn’t mean we’re more valuable as a human. We become indifferent to our status we can focus on how to live more mindfully, gratefully, and with more joy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLike Ki Woo placing the viewing stone into the river at the end, we can realize that the meaning behind the stone – its symbol of status and importance – was just an illusion. Even after its role in the destruction of three families we see that it was really just a rock. Riches are just riches. Reputation is just reputation. Neither completely in our control. This film can be a powerful reminder of the illusions we spend years worrying about and convince us, a little, to let them go.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat’s so scary about this interpretation I’m offering is the idea that some will hear this and think I am saying that the rich should stay rich and the impoverished should just learn to get over it. This is not at all what I’m saying. Living with food, shelter, and utility insecurities is a reality for millions of people and everyone, regardless of their status, should have access to resources that help them fulfill their basic needs. Its an unfortunate reality that  many people have to work incredibly hard within a system pitted against them to just survive and there should definitely be systemic changes driven by the everyday citizen like ourselves to appeal to local governments to provide more care for the underprivileged. There is real change needed. All I am trying to address is the emotional and psychological well-being of everyone struggling with status anxiety – in all rungs of society.\n\nI do believe that social mobility is a worthwhile pursuit and we can still work hard and do our best to gain more comforts in life, even if its an uphill and inequitable battle for many, but my message is that we also need to mentally budget for the fact that we live in societies riddled with status obsession and prejudice against the underprivileged. We cannot rely on societies riddled with status anxiety to respect us as we should be respected but we can work to develop a strong sense of self-respect and self-worth regardless of our jobs or bank balances and we can guard ourselves against making high status a prerequisite for self-compassion or happiness.\n\nWe can’t change what others say or do, but we can un-assign meaning from what our homes or closets look like to others. We can learn to shrug off the invisible boundaries and smells the rich talk about, we can ignore the inner voices trained into us telling us we need to accomplish more in order to earn or be worthy of admiration from ourselves or others. We can curate our happiness and self-respect within ourselves and for ourselves.\n\nLastly, If we no longer make high status or praise a prerequisite for our happiness or sense of identity we’ll discover the freedom to live a simple life happily. We can unlock the freedom of never having to prove our worth to others or hurt others in a competition for status but to enjoy our lives as they are while also setting future goals that aren’t fueled by an obsession with high esteem and status.\n\nIn the end, the tragedy Parasite reminds us  that the system is inherently unfair and that there is an undercurrent of status anxiety we all feel that feeds the imaginary and hurtful boundaries of status and respect. We’re reminded to, of course, take action in our lives to take care of ourselves and our loved ones, and to help those struggling as the Kims are, but we can also use this film as a reminder to soothe our status anxiety once in a while so that it doesn’t motivate us into abandoning our integrity or self-compassion.\n\nTaking inspiration from the tragedy of the Kims, we can place our own viewing stones back into the river and remember what truly matters in life.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nI’ll be trying to re-upload the video sometime in March 2022, as well.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nJanicke-Bowles, S.

I’m not scared to say that it’s also a dreadful fun-house of subverted expectations. What I’m scared to say is that this black comedy reads much better as a <genre>Tragedy</genre> – and that the Tragedy of the Kims has a very real villain – a force that dooms everyone in the story, infecting their lives from the inside out – but this villain might live somewhere we don’t really want to accept.</p>\n        <p><name>Parasite</name> and its message on class relations elicits many strong, destabilizing emotions – it can leave audiences paralyzed by dread, anger, desperation, denial, or an overwhelming apathy.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <p>True of all of my Screen Therapy reviews, I’ll do my best to model how to interpret films from a Positive Media Literacy lens. My writing is informed by Positive Media Psychology techniques – techniques that can be used to take impactful films, games, or other media we come across and use them mindfully as tools for self-discovery and self-improvement.</p>\n        <p>So, in short, my aim with this review, like all my other reviews, is to do more than just talk about the film’s artistry or how well-written it is – but to go a step further and make it useful for us in a practical way. I will explore what we can learn from this powerful story that can actually help us understand ourselves and the world around us a little better.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>How is <name>Parasite</name> (<releaseYear>2019</releaseYear>) a <genre>Tragedy</genre>?</h2>\n        <p>When I say the conclusion of the film is “Tragic” I’m arguing that this film, although its categorized as a <genre>Black Comedy</genre>, reads much closer to a classic <genre>Tragedy</genre> with a capital T.</p>\n        <p>Tragic plots, as summarized by Media Psychologists C. Scott Rigby and Richard M. Ryan in the Handbook of Media Use and Well-Being, are plots that entail fundamental conflicts which cause tension and whose resolution is in doubt. Tragic conflicts are between extrinsic goals for power or wealth and intrinsic moral or prosocial pursuits.</p>\n        <p>“In tragic narratives, there is a desire to achieve a specific goal that is often pursued as a non-autonomous or obsessive passion.”</p>\n        <p>And, of course, Tragedies almost always result in the downfall of our lead protagonists, usually just as they acquired or are about to acquire what they always wanted. And many tragedies, like Oedipus Rex, feature relatable and underdog protagonists who commit some terrible crime without realizing the depth of what they’re doing. As the protagonist realizes their error their world and accomplishments crumble around them. Through hubris, they realize they overstretched themselves and crash, like Icarus, back down to Earth.</p>\n        <p>We see these themes played out perfectly by the Kim family. They find incredible opportunities to fulfill goals for wealth, dignity, respect, and status.</p>\n        <p>They’re willing to overlook some moral codes and even forsake compassionate attitudes to maintain what they’ve accumulated. And like a true <genre>Tragedy</genre> written by Sophocles or Euripedes these characters still remain highly relatable. No matter what they do, knowingly or unknowingly, we want them to succeed – we want them to stay safe and get a happy ending. And so, regardless of what crimes our protagonists commit we’re enraged, horrified, overcome with pity or terror when we see their demise.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>The Cause of the <genre>Tragedy</genre></h2>\n        <p>A typical reading might say that the Kims experienced their tragedy because they were either too greedy or they were pushed into desperation by the rich Park family.</p>\n        <p>This is a heated debate, actually. One that I was too shy to enter till now. Many people read the film as a narrative about the evils of a detached, un-empathetic, greedy upper class – but, to me, this doesn’t really make complete sense.</p>\n        <p>I’ve tried the reading of the villainous rich family that pressured the Kims into their moral ambiguity and downfall but it never sat well with me since the worst crime I could pin on the Parks was snobbery and cold manners while the moral infringements the Kims committed stacked relatively higher.</p>\n        <p>The Kims hurt several people to get what they wanted and even contemplated or accidentally committed murder.</p>\n        <p>Of course, we don’t know what the Parks did to get rich – its never explained – who knows if Mr. Park was somehow hurting people with his job or hurt people to climb the ladder, or maybe he, like many wealthy people in real life, simply had wealthy parents- but there was never investigation into whether Mr. Park earned his wealth morally or not. There’s nothing else in the story that shows any of the Parks being anything but oblivious and sometimes rude.</p>\n        <p>So, unfortunately, I couldn’t join those who blamed the rich for the tragedy of the Kims. Although, absolutely, the lack of social infrastructure and welfare programs to bridge inequality and provide resources to the disadvantaged is a key factor in the Kims’ lives and the snobbery they experienced from the rich definitely aggravated their condition. And it can be argued that the main lesson we should take from <name>Parasite</name> would be an urgent plea to bridge opportunity gaps and invest in social welfare programs that would combat food or shelter insecurities. But, again, my analyses always look at the psychological and emotional lessons we can take from a story and classic Tragedies also focus the individual’s actions instead of creating social commentaries.</p>\n        <p>So, what individual microcosmic events or perspectives led to the Kims’ tragedies?</p>\n        <p>The cause of the tragedy, the acute condition that plagued all the characters, poor or rich, and the force that motivated the final crimes of the film was something called <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> – and it lives silently gnawing away in almost all of us.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>What is <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth>?</h2>\n        <p><psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> is a term coined by philosopher Alain de Botton. Its one of his most helpful insights.</p>\n        <p><psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> is the anxiety concerned with our status in society: how we’re seen, judged, and valued based on our occupation, wealth, or how many nice things we own.</p>\n        <p>It’s that panic we experience when someone asks us, “So what do you do?“, and we suddenly feel self-conscious that our answer won’t persuade the person asking us to understand just how worthwhile and valuable we are as a person because we’re not a high level executive with a complicated title. Its the all-motivating fear that we don’t have a high enough status to earn dignity or respect.</p>\n        <p><psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> makes it feel like a tall order to hope that the person who asks us what we do for a living should still be interested in us as a friend or even as a human being if we say we fold pizza boxes or, god forbid, that we’re unemployed.</p>\n        <p><psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> runs deep in highly individualistic meritocratic societies where our worth is routinely measured by the status of our jobs, our wealth, our possessions, our style, and our reputation with others of high status.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>All the Characters Suffer From <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth></h2>\n        <p>All the characters in this film are living and breathing <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth>. This film is an exploration on how <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> is upheld by imaginary lines, rules, and the rationing of dignity and respect.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2><name>The Kim Family</name></h2>\n        <p>First, looking at the Kims, they are the most obvious victims of <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth>. More than anyone else in the film, this family knows the sorrows of being seen as lesser than. As the film progresses we witness a bitterness grow in the Kims.</p>\n        <p>After being confronted with the lines and boundaries enforced by the rich they struggle to reconcile how they’re seen and treated because of their low status and the knowledge that they deserve more dignity and comfort.</p>\n        <p>However, the Kims were the perfect protagonists because they subvert many expectations that <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> instills in us. They are not living in low status in a subterranean apartment because they are “dumb” or “lazy”.</p>\n        <p>The opening scenes establish right away that although the Kims are dealing with shelter and food insecurity – they are intelligent, cunning, and work very hard to attain even basic necessities. They are doing the best they can with the few resources they have. We see through them that they don’t choose poverty – they are unlucky, unsupported, and marginalized. Those in impoverished conditions are usually made invisible by <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> in real life – those who observe status rules have learned to ignore real-life Kims or think harshly of them and their lifestyle – but by making a family like the Kims our main characters in a film like this – they are brought out of the obscurity they’re usually kept in in real life and quickly become sympathetic underdogs that everyone wants to root for.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>How Do <genre>Tragedies</genre> Help Us?</h2>\n        <p><genre>Tragedies</genre> offer us important learning opportunities and emotional experiences. In the essay Meaningful Entertainment in an Introduction to Positive Media Psychology, you’ll find some corrective language that explains although <genre>tragedies</genre> are so popular we don’t necessarily psychologically “enjoy” <genre>tragedies</genre>, we don’t enjoy them like our other media, instead we “appreciate” them. This distinction is important because although we don’t feel happy from watching <name>Parasite</name>, we don’t have the positive feelings of “enjoying” it, it received so much attention because we “appreciated” how deeply it made us feel and think. Enjoyment is short-lived, but Appreciation responses to media are characterized by the audience feeling motivated to participate in self-reflection, self-development, relationship reflection, and personal growth. In short – we like <genre>tragedies</genre> because they help us discover who we are.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n        <p>What’s so scary about this interpretation I’m offering is the idea that some will hear this and think I am saying that the rich should stay rich and the impoverished should just learn to get over it. This is not at all what I’m saying. Living with food, shelter, and utility insecurities is a reality for millions of people and everyone, regardless of their status, should have access to resources that help them fulfill their basic needs. Its an unfortunate reality that many people have to work incredibly hard within a system pitted against them to just survive and there should definitely be systemic changes driven by the everyday citizen like ourselves to appeal to local governments to provide more care for the underprivileged. There is real change needed. All I am trying to address is the emotional and psychological well-being of everyone struggling with <psychologicalDepth>Status Anxiety</psychologicalDepth> – in all rungs of society.</p>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have inserted the relevant XML tags according to the attributes specified in the ADT.

And why I say \"scene-by-scene basis\", I really almost mean a \"shot-by-shot basis\", or maybe something even more finely grained than that. This is film in which the very good and the very irritating exist so closely hand-in-hand that I'm not always sure it's possible to articulate which is which.\n\n\n\r\nThe film, the second feature directed by Jung Byung-gil, and enough of an exemplar of the current state of South Korean action cinema that it snagged a non-competitive berth at Cannes in 2017, is basically a tale of revenge. Who's getting revenge on whom changes. The protagonist, however, is always a particular woman who goes by different names, though the one that she was born with is Sook-hee (Kim Ok-bin). The point at which you need diagrams to keep the plot straight happens damned early, but suffice it to say that Sook-hee was raised from a child (possibly by the Chinese government? Or at least by a Chinese paramilitary group) to be a perfect assassin, and has since grown up to be recruited - \"conscripted\" is at least as good a word - by a South Korean intelligence agency. So  gets to have the best of a spy thriller and the best of an assassin thriller at one and the same time, assuming we can fairly draw a clear dividing line between those branches.\n\n\n\r\nAnd there's a third, much more clearly distinguishable branch: this is also an art film. I mean that in only the most perfectly ordinary sense: this is a movie obsessively concerned with the mental and emotional depths of its lead character and only incidentally with what she does, and so we must say that it is more psychology-driven than narrative-driven. And if there is indeed a problem with , this is what causes it. The script (co-written by the director and by Jung Byeong-sik) elects to dig into Sook-hee's motivations and her overall feelings about the blood-soaked paths she walks on through an unusually difficult network of flashbacks and callbacks, and that within a film that doesn't itself follow one strict chronological line for its A-plot from which the flashbacks spring. I'm relatively confident in suggesting that this isn't mere petty obscurantism; Jung and Jung do seem to have a very clear intention for how this is all meant to work in one intuitive flow, with Sook-hee's history being doled out to us in an order and at times that always meaningfully reflect how her past informs her present. Not in general terms, the way all of our pasts inform all of our presents, but the very specific aspect of past that informs , .\n\n\n\r\nOne result is a film with a curious and apparently intentional arrhythmia; there's no real flow here of any kind, lest it be the pure flow of momentum in the ebb and flow of fight scenes. I feel like I should be a bit more enthusiastic about this, and my expectation and hope is that when I see  a second time, this will all click into place more naturally than it did when I was watching. As it is, it's a movie whose plot takes some real effort to keep straight, and while this is not generally a problem for action movies,  is quite obviously proud of itself as a character study, and eager to make sure that it foregrounds Sook-hee's personal tragedies and the violent revenge those tragedies fueled.\n\n\n\r\nRegardless of that, the worst-case scenario is that this is an action film with a character arc that's presented unnecessarily confusingly, but which doestn't detract from the action. All the best-case scenarios involve some variation on  having some of the very best action setpieces of 2017, and wouldn't you just look at that...\n\n\n\r\nIt's not merely that the action is superb in this movie; it's superb without ever repeating itself, and that's all the more impressive because there is . Between themselves, Jung, cinematographer Park Jung-hun, and stunt coordinator Kwon Gui-duck have arranged a great many variations on a few themes, starting with the most unabashedly gimmicky: the film opens with a synthetic long take in first person, as Sook-hee plows through a hallway and room full of expendable bad guys, without our ever getting a good look at whose body we're inhabiting until one goon shoves here face in a mirror - the exact point at which the camera decouples from her POV. These elaborate camera moves remain a reliable tool for the filmmakers throughout, not always to the film's benefit; it's pretty easy to spot the cuts, which haven't been digitally melted together as perfectly as one might want. And if I'm griping, I might as well point out that Park sometimes uses wider lenses than I care for, giving the action a warping quality.\n\n\n\r\nBut, dear Lord, let's not be assholes about such things!  is an amazing achievement in action movement, lighting, costume design, and framing, whether in the most elaborate, showy gyrating movements, or a downright stately shot where Sook-hee, in a bridal gown, strikes an elegant pose against a mirror as she points a sniper rifle through a ventilation shaft. The broad purpose is the same in all cases: to draw our attention to admire the control Kim exerts over her body, which is after all the film's primary storytelling vehicle, given how much of it is entirely about the complicated action scenes Kim is dropped into.\n\n\n\r\nIt is, long story short, an incredibly gorgeous film, and a film that has some truly magnificent fight choreography along the way (not  treated to best effect by the rest of the filmmaking.

            "spanned_content": "<article>\n    <title>The Lady Killer</title>\n    <content>\n        Depending on what you're watching for, on a scene-by-scene basis might be anything from a contender for <releaseYear>2017</releaseYear>'s most powerfully image-driven film to a frustrating, confusing and alienating affair of watching non-characters maneuver through a non-plot while gushing jets of blood. And why I say \"scene-by-scene basis\", I really almost mean a \"shot-by-shot basis\", or maybe something even more finely grained than that. This is film in which the very good and the very irritating exist so closely hand-in-hand that I'm not always sure it's possible to articulate which is which.\n\n        The film, the second feature directed by <director>Jung Byung-gil</director>, and enough of an exemplar of the current state of South Korean <genre>action</genre> cinema that it snagged a non-competitive berth at Cannes in <releaseYear>2017</releaseYear>, is basically a tale of revenge. Who's getting revenge on whom changes. The protagonist, however, is always a particular woman who goes by different names, though the one that she was born with is Sook-hee (Kim Ok-bin). The point at which you need diagrams to keep the plot straight happens damned early, but suffice it to say that Sook-hee was raised from a child (possibly by the Chinese government? Or at least by a Chinese paramilitary group) to be a perfect assassin, and has since grown up to be recruited - \"conscripted\" is at least as good a word - by a South Korean intelligence agency. So gets to have the best of a spy thriller and the best of an assassin thriller at one and the same time, assuming we can fairly draw a clear dividing line between those branches.\n\n        And there's a third, much more clearly distinguishable branch: this is also an art film. I mean that in only the most perfectly ordinary sense: this is a movie obsessively concerned with the mental and emotional depths of its lead character and only incidentally with what she does, and so we must say that it is more <psychologicalDepth>psychology-driven</psychologicalDepth> than narrative-driven. And if there is indeed a problem with <title>The Lady Killer</title>, this is what causes it. The script (co-written by the director and by Jung Byeong-sik) elects to dig into Sook-hee's motivations and her overall feelings about the blood-soaked paths she walks on through an unusually difficult network of flashbacks and callbacks, and that within a film that doesn't itself follow one strict chronological line for its A-plot from which the flashbacks spring. I'm relatively confident in suggesting that this isn't mere petty obscurantism; Jung and Jung do seem to have a very clear intention for how this is all meant to work in one intuitive flow, with Sook-hee's history being doled out to us in an order and at times that always meaningfully reflect how her past informs her present. Not in general terms, the way all of our pasts inform all of our presents, but the very specific aspect of past that informs <title>The Lady Killer</title>.\n\n        One result is a film with a curious and apparently intentional arrhythmia; there's no real flow here of any kind, lest it be the pure flow of momentum in the ebb and flow of fight scenes. I feel like I should be a bit more enthusiastic about this, and my expectation and hope is that when I see <title>The Lady Killer</title> a second time, this will all click into place more naturally than it did when I was watching. As it is, it's a movie whose plot takes some real effort to keep straight, and while this is not generally a problem for action movies, <title>The Lady Killer</title> is quite obviously proud of itself as a character study, and eager to make sure that it foregrounds Sook-hee's personal tragedies and the violent revenge those tragedies fueled.\n\n        Regardless of that, the worst-case scenario is that this is an action film with a character arc that's presented unnecessarily confusingly, but which doesn't detract from the action. All the best-case scenarios involve some variation on <title>The Lady Killer</title> having some of the very best action setpieces of <releaseYear>2017</releaseYear>, and wouldn't you just look at that...\n\n        It's not merely that the action is superb in this movie; it's superb without ever repeating itself, and that's all the more impressive because there is. Between themselves, Jung, cinematographer Park Jung-hun, and stunt coordinator Kwon Gui-duck have arranged a great many variations on a few themes, starting with the most unabashedly gimmicky: the film opens with a synthetic long take in first person, as Sook-hee plows through a hallway and room full of expendable bad guys, without our ever getting a good look at whose body we're inhabiting until one goon shoves her face in a mirror - the exact point at which the camera decouples from her POV. These elaborate camera moves remain a reliable tool for the filmmakers throughout, not always to the film's benefit; it's pretty easy to spot the cuts, which haven't been digitally melted together as perfectly as one might want. And if I'm griping, I might as well point out that Park sometimes uses wider lenses than I care for, giving the action a warping quality.\n\n        But, dear Lord, let's not be assholes about such things! <title>The Lady Killer</title> is an amazing achievement in action movement, lighting, costume design, and framing, whether in the most elaborate, showy gyrating movements, or a downright stately shot where Sook-hee, in a bridal gown, strikes an elegant pose against a mirror as she points a sniper rifle through a ventilation shaft. The broad purpose is the same in all cases: to draw our attention to admire the control Kim exerts over her body, which is after all the film's primary storytelling vehicle, given how much of it is entirely about the complicated action scenes Kim is dropped into.\n\n        It is, long story short, an incredibly gorgeous film, and a film that has some truly magnificent fight choreography along the way (not <title>The Lady Killer</title> treated to best effect by the rest of the filmmaking. It is, in its way, a pure action film, designed solely for the pleasure of movement through space, the violence that ensues - this is a <title>The Lady Killer</title> movie, no two ways about it - and the shifting values of light that accentuate both the movement and violence. It's even more invested in aesthetics, in this regard, than something like <title>The Lady Killer</title> or <title>The Lady Killer</title>, works apparently springing from the same international Zeitgeist.

The screenplay was based on the plays The Greeks Had a Word for It (1930) by Zoe Akins and Loco (1946) by Dale Eunson and Katherine Albert.[3]\n\nIt stars Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall as three fashionable Manhattan models, along with William Powell, David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, and Cameron Mitchell as their wealthy marks.\n\nProduced and distributed by 20th Century-Fox, How to Marry a Millionaire was the studio's first film to be shot in the new CinemaScope wide-screen sound process, although it was the second CinemaScope film released by Fox after the biblical epic film The Robe (also 1953). It was also the first color and CinemaScope film ever shown on prime-time network television (though panned-and-scanned) when it was presented as the first film on NBC's Saturday Night at the Movies on September 23, 1961.[4]\n\nThe soundtrack to How to Marry a Millionaire was released on CD by Film Score Monthly on March 15, 2001.[5]\n\n## Plot\n\nMonroe as Pola, Grable as Loco, and Bacall as Schatze\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResourceful Schatze Page, spunky Loco Dempsey, and ditzy Pola Debevoise are three women on a mission: each wants to marry a millionaire. To accomplish this task, they rent a luxurious Sutton Place penthouse in New York City from Freddie Denmark (who is avoiding the IRS by living in Europe) and together hatch a plot to court the city's elite. On the day they move in, Loco arrives with Tom Brookman, who purchases her groceries for her because she \"forgot her pocketbook\". Tom shows interest in Schatze but she dismisses him, stating that \"The first rule is, gentlemen callers have got to wear a necktie\" and, instead, sets her sights on the charming, classy, rich widower J.D. Hanley. While courting the older J.D., she fends off Tom, who eventually wins her over. After every date, she insists she never wants to see him again.\n\nMeanwhile, Loco meets grumpy businessman Walter Brewster. He is married, but she agrees to accompany him to his lodge in Maine, thinking it is a convention hall of the Elks Club. Just as Loco discovers her mistake, she comes down with the measles and is quarantined. Upon recovering, while Brewster is now bedridden with measles, she begins seeing the forest ranger, Eben Salem. Loco mistakenly believes Salem is a wealthy landowner instead of a civil servant overseeing acres of forestlands. She is disappointed, telling off Brewster on the drive back to New York.\n\nPola is romanced by a phony tycoon, played by Alexander D'Arcy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPola is myopic but hates wearing glasses in the presence of men. She falls for a phony oil tycoon, J. Stewart Merrill, unaware that he is a crooked speculator. When she takes a plane from LaGuardia Airport to meet him in Atlantic City, she ends up on the wrong plane to Kansas City. On the plane, she encounters the mysterious Freddie Denmark again, having unknowingly met him when he entered his apartment to retrieve his tax documents as proof that his crooked accountant stole his money and left him in trouble with the IRS. Freddie also wears glasses and encourages Pola to wear hers as well. They fall quickly in love and get married.\n\nWilliam Powell as J.D. Hanley prepares to marry Schatze, with Loco and Pola as bridesmaids\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLoco and Pola are reunited with Schatze just before her wedding to J.D. Hanley. Schatze is unable to go through with the marriage and confesses to J.D. that she loves Tom. He agrees to call off the ceremony. Tom is among the wedding guests and the two reconcile and marry. Afterwards, the three happy couples end up at a greasy spoon diner. Schatze jokingly asks Eben and Freddie about their financial prospects, which are slim. When she finally gets around to Tom, he casually admits a net worth of around $200 million, which no one takes seriously. He then calls for the check, pulls out an enormous wad of money, and pays with a $1,000 bill, telling the chef to keep the change. The three astonished women faint, and the men drink a toast to their unconscious wives.\n\n## Cast\n\n- Betty Grable as Loco Dempsey\n- Marilyn Monroe as Pola Debevoise\n- Lauren Bacall as Schatze Page\n- David Wayne as Freddie Denmark\n- Rory Calhoun as Eben Salem\n- Cameron Mitchell as Tom Brookman\n- Alex D'Arcy as J.

Although the latter was completed first, the studio chose to present The Robe as its first CinemaScope picture in late September or early October 1953 because it felt the family-friendly The Robe would attract a larger audience to its new widescreen process.[7]\n\nThe film's cinematography was by Joseph MacDonald. The costume design was by Travilla.[8]\n\n### Portrayal of New York\n\nBetween scenes, the cinematography has some iconic color views of mid-20th century New York City: Rockefeller Center, Central Park, the United Nations Building, and Brooklyn Bridge in the opening sequence following the credits. Other iconic views include the Empire State Building, the lights of Times Square at night and the George Washington Bridge.\n\n### Music\n\nA song extolling the virtues of New York follows the Gershwin-like music used for the title credits, after an elaborate five-minute pre-credit sequence showcasing a 70-piece orchestra conducted by Alfred Newman before the curtain goes up.[9]\n\nThe score for How To Marry a Millionaire was one of the first recorded for film in stereo. It was composed and directed by Alfred Newman, with incidental music by Cyril Mockridge, and orchestrated by Edward B. Powell.[10] The album was released on CD by Film Score Monthly on March 15, 2001[11] as part of their series Golden Age Classics.\n\nThe film's theatrical version begins with a nearly six-minute overture of Newman's symphonic piece \"Street Scene\", which he wrote in the style of George Gershwin. It is played on-screen by an 80-piece studio orchestra (billed as \"The Twentieth Century Fox Symphony Orchestra\"). Newman wrote the piece for the 1931 film Street Scene, which featured his first complete film score.\n\n## Release\n\n### Release and box office\n\nThe film premiered at the Fox Wilshire Theatre (now the Saban Theatre), in Beverly Hills, California on November 4, 1953.[12] It was a box office success, earning $8 million worldwide[2] and $7.5 million domestically, second that year only to The Robe.[13] It was the fourth highest-grossing film of 1953, whereas Monroe's previous feature, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, was seventh.\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe New York Times's Bosley Crowther wrote \"the substance is still insufficient for the vast spread of screen which CinemaScope throws across the front of the theatre, and the impression it leaves is that of nonsense from a few people in a great big hall.\"[14]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 28 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.2/10.[15]\n\n### Award nominations\n\n| Award                               | Category                     | Subject                              | Result    |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Academy Awards[16]                  | Best Costume Design – Color  | Charles LeMaire and William Travilla | Nominated |\n| British Academy Film Awards[17]     | Best Film from any Source    | How to Marry a Millionaire           | Nominated |\n| Writers Guild of America Awards[18] | Best Written American Comedy | Nunnally Johnson                     | Nominated |\n\n## Television adaptation\n\nIn 1957, the film was adapted into a sitcom also titled How to Marry a Millionaire. It starred Barbara Eden (as Loco Jones), Merry Anders (Michelle \"Mike\" Page), Lori Nelson (Greta Lindquist) and as Nelson's later replacement, Lisa Gaye as Gwen Kirby. It aired in syndication for two seasons.\n\n## Remake\n\nIn 2000, 20th Century Fox Television produced a made-for-TV remake, How to Marry a Billionaire: A Christmas Tale. It reversed the sex roles, and had three men looking to marry wealthy women. It starred John Stamos, Joshua Malina and Shemar Moore.\n\nIn 2007, Nicole Kidman bought the rights to How to Marry a Millionaire under her production company Blossom Films, intending to produce and possibly star in a remake.[19]\n\n## References\n\n- ^ Solomon 1989, p. 248.\n- ^ a b Solomon 1989, p. 89.\n- ^ \"How to Marry a Millionaire (1953)\".

Gabriel Macht's inspiration to become a producer in the series (and take control in areas such as casting department) came when he was watching Sem Saída (2009), a comedy show where the actor and singer Gustavo Goulart is responsible for many departments at the same time. Macht noticed that it gave a special mark to the project, so he decided to take more control of his series too.\n\n- GoofsRecurring monitor and laptop display.

The left top-most window shows file icons. The second, shows what looks like an email app, with an email with two paragraphs in it. Episode 7 season 4 at minute 13:13 shows instance of the screen.\n\n- QuotesHarvey Specter: Anyone can do my job, but no one can be me.\n\n- ConnectionsFeatured in 18th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards (2012)\n\n### User reviews904\n\nFeatured review\n\n### Good looking series\n\nAfter watching the pilot episode I was pleased from what I saw. The episode was long enough to give us a glimpse into some interesting characters. There seems to be a lot to go around with both leads social lives and how they impact the secondary characters. There Is no shortage of eye candy. I did find some of the time lines a bit of a stretch, but nothing major. I most enjoyed how the writers took the time to give good background material on just about the whole cast witch I think Is becoming so rare, knowing this info helps to get into these characters from the start. I recommend this show to viewers who like a lawyer type show with just a touch of softness.\n\n- lamont-hard\n- Jun 24, 2011\n- Permalink\n\n### Top picks\n\nSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations\n\n### FAQ22\n\n- How many seasons does Suits have?Powered by Alexa\n- Where can I find a song I heard during the show?\n- What is the theme song?\n\n### Details\n\n- Release date\n    - August 15, 2011 (Australia)\n- Country of origin\n    - United States\n- Official sites\n    - Official Facebook\n    - Official site\n- Language\n    - English\n- Also known as\n    - A Legal Mind\n- Filming locations\n    - Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n- Production companies\n    - Hypnotic\n    - Universal Cable Productions\n    - Dutch Oven\n- See more company credits at IMDbPro\n\n### Tech specs\n\n- Runtime45 minutes\n- Color\n    - Color\n- Sound mix\n    - Dolby Digital\n- Aspect ratio\n    - 1.78 : 1\n\n### Related news\n\n### Contribute to this page\n\nSuggest an edit or add missing content\n\n- IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data\n- Learn more about contributing\n\n### More to explore\n\n### Recently viewed\n\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nFollow IMDb on social\n\nGet the IMDb app\n\nFor Android and iOS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Help\n- Site Index\n- IMDbPro\n- Box Office Mojo\n- License IMDb Data\n\n- Press Room\n- Advertising\n- Jobs\n- Conditions of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- Your Ads Privacy Choices\n\n© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The series was created by Robert and Michelle King and stars Julianna Margulies, Josh Charles, Christine Baranski, Matt Czuchry, Archie Panjabi, Zach Grenier, Matthew Goode, Cush Jumbo, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Alan Cumming, and features Chris Noth in a recurring role. The executive producers included the Kings, Ridley and Tony Scott, Charles McDougall, and David W. Zucker.[2][3]\n\nThe Good Wife is a serialized show, featuring several story arcs that play out over multiple episodes, as well as standalone storylines that are concluded by the end of each episode. The serial plots—a rarity on CBS, a network where most of the programming at that time was procedural—were especially showcased in its highly praised fifth season.[4]\n\nThe Good Wife was acclaimed during its run and considered by several critics to be network television's \"last great drama\".[5][6][7] It won numerous awards, including five Emmys and the 2014 Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. The performances of the show's cast have been particularly recognized, with Julianna Margulies, Archie Panjabi, Christine Baranski, and Josh Charles each receiving widespread acclaim.[8] The show was also lauded for its insight on social media and the internet in society, politics, and law. It received recognition for producing full 22-episode seasons while other similarly acclaimed dramas often produce only 6 to 13 episodes per season. CBS announced during the Super Bowl on February 7, 2016, that the show was ending with its seventh season.[9] The final episode aired on May 8, 2016.[10][11] A spinoff titled The Good Fight, centered around Baranski's character Diane Lockhart and Cush Jumbo's Lucca Quinn, also starring Rose Leslie and Delroy Lindo, premiered in February 2017.\n\n## Premise\n\nSet in Chicago, the series focuses on Alicia Florrick (Margulies), whose husband Peter (Noth), the former Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney, has been jailed following a notorious political corruption and sex scandal. After having spent the previous 13 years as a stay-at-home mother, Alicia returns to the workforce as a litigator to provide for her two children.[12]\n\n## Production\n\n### Conception\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWriters Michelle and Robert King wanted to create a series that focused on the wife of a high-profile politician following a public sex scandal. They got the idea after they observed prominent American scandals of this nature, such as those involving President Bill Clinton and North Carolina Senator John Edwards. The image of a wife standing silently beside her husband as he publicly admits to his sexual or political misconduct had become clichéd, according to Robert King.[13] This image led the Kings to question why these women stood by their husbands, as well as to wonder about the events that followed that initial announcement. They were further intrigued by the fact that many of the wives were lawyers who had halted their personal careers for the sake of their husbands' professional ambitions.[13] The actual idea for the series was first postulated in the weeks following the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal of 2008.[14] As Michelle King explains:\n\nYou know, what's interesting about a lot of these political scandals is that the women are lawyers, too. Hillary is a lawyer. Elizabeth Edwards is a lawyer. I think that got us thinking along those lines. That is, we knew she had to go back to work, and we had so many female lawyers to draw on.[15]\n\n### Production\n\nRobert and Michelle King at the 2015 PaleyFest presentation for The Good Wife\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe series was created by Michelle and Robert King, who serve as executive producers and show runners.[2] The pair had produced the short-lived legal drama In Justice that aired as a mid-season replacement in early 2006.[16] The creators had previously worked extensively in feature films. Scott Free productions helped to finance The Good Wife and Ridley Scott, Tony Scott (until his death) and David W. Zucker are credited as executive producers.[17][18]\n\nExecutive producer Dee Johnson added television writing experience to the team.[16][18] Charles McDougall directed the pilot episode and was the pilot's other executive producer.[19] McDougall had previously enjoyed success as the director of the pilot for Desperate Housewives. All seven executive producers returned when a full series was ordered and they were joined by executive producer Brooke Kennedy.[20] McDougall left the crew after directing and executive producing the second episode.[20][21] The series is produced by Bernadette Caulfield who had previously worked on the HBO polygamy drama Big Love; co-producer Ron Binkowski added post production experience to the pilot and returned for the first season.\n\nSeveral new producers were added to the crew once CBS ordered a full season. Angela Amato Velez joined the crew as a consulting producer and writer bringing legal experience from her careers as a police officer and legal aid attorney and writing experience from the police dramas Third Watch and Southland. Todd Ellis Kessler, who had recently completed production on The Unit, and had previously worked on legal drama The Practice, joined the staff as a co-executive producer and writer.[22] Ted Humphrey served as a supervising producer and writer and then as co-executive producer and writer. Corinne Brinkerhoff completed the production team as a writer and co-producer. Brinkerhoff had previously worked as a writer and story editor on Boston Legal. David W. Zucker is an executive producer on the show, having been nominated for four Primetime Emmys and one PGA Award. His credits included Judging Amy, The Pillars of the Earth, and Law Dogs.[23]\n\nAlthough the series is set in Chicago, it was filmed in New York, with an interior set in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.[24][25] The Kings and the writing staff were based in Los Angeles and used teleconferencing to plan with the director of each episode.[16]\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made an appearance as himself in 2013.[26] His successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he was \"deeply obsessed\" with the show, made an appearance as himself in 2014.[27][28] Gloria Steinem, Valerie Jarrett, Donna Brazile also made appearances, as did Frank Seddio, then-chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party. [29][30][31][32]\n\nAuthenticity of plot and characters was achieved through the use of script consultants, including Karen Kessler, who is a founding member and president of Evergreen Partners Inc., a public relations and events planning firm.\n\nIn May 2015, TVLine reported that Julianna Margulies and Archie Panjabi did not actually film on set together a final scene between Alicia and Kalinda in the season 6 finale, with shots of the two characters spliced together in post-production, after ongoing reporting had noticed that the characters had not shared a scene in several episodes.[33][34][35][36][37][38] In a subsequent interview in August 2015, the producers said they would not go into the mechanics of filming in order to address \"gossip\" about an alleged rift between the two actresses.[39] In October 2015, Margulies stated at The New Yorker Festival that \"it was shot the way Robert wanted to shoot it, and the story line, too\" and also referred to the timing of Panjabi's work on the series The Fall, however in response to an article about Margulies' comments, Panjabi posted on Twitter that \"The Fall was not even in production at that time and I was in New York ready to film the scene.\"[40][41][42]\n\n## Cast and characters\n\n### Main characters\n\n- Julianna Margulies as Alicia Florrick. The wife of Peter, a disgraced State's Attorney, Alicia returns to work as a junior litigator at the law firm Stern, Lockhart &amp;amp; Gardner thanks to the support of her old law school friend Will Gardner, for whom she has feelings. Having spent so many years as \"the good wife\", she finds herself at the bottom of the career ladder, trying to juggle both home and professional life with the scandal surrounding her husband, with whom she has two children, Zach and Grace. Alicia is smart, independent, fiercely protective of her children, and much more than just a good wife. She excels at keeping a cool exterior. She is rarely ruffled and almost always thinks through what she is going to say, choosing her words for maximum impact or sting. Alicia graduated top of her class from Georgetown University Law Center in the mid-1990s. After graduation she worked at Crozier, Abrams &amp;amp; Abbott for about two years but left to focus on her kids and Peter's career. Her struggles to go back to work and how she is penalized for the \"mommy gap\", are seen as emblematic of the work–life struggles of real working women.[43] She and her gay younger brother, Owen, have a loving relationship despite having personalities that are opposites. In Season 3, Alicia is a third-year associate at the firm. She and Peter are separated and she has an affair with Will but by mid-season, she breaks it off. Alicia struggles with her feelings for Peter. She is deeply hurt and has not entirely forgiven him but she still loves him. Toward the end of Season 3, Peter announces his candidacy for governor of Illinois; Alicia stands at his side as he makes the announcement. In Season 4, Alicia gets and takes a promotion as an equity partner of the firm and begins planning to start a new firm with Cary. After Will dies in Season 5, Alicia goes into a period of mourning and separates from Peter, maintaining their marriage for the sake of their careers. In Season 6, Alicia runs for State's Attorney and develops a friendship with prosecutor Finn Polmar. Soon after winning the election, Alicia is caught up in an electoral fraud scandal, and though innocent, must resign her post. Broken and humiliated once again, she returns to law, working initially as a bond court lawyer before starting a small private practice in her apartment.\n- Matt Czuchry as Cary Agos, a young Harvard-educated lawyer. In the first season, he is a first year associate at Lockhart Gardner with Alicia Florrick. In the first episode, it is established that there is only one permanent position, putting Cary into competition with Alicia. At the end of the first season, the firm selects Alicia, and Cary goes to work for the state attorney's office. In season three, Cary is appointed Cook County Deputy State's Attorney, though he subsequently is demoted for having an in-office affair. Dissatisfied with the demotion, he accepts an offer to return to Lockhart Gardner. He is often placed in rivalry with Alicia and sometimes resents her for this and her political connections thanks to her husband, Peter Florrick, the disgraced State's Attorney. His own career trajectory takes many twists and turns, often because of bad luck, but Cary maintains his integrity and loyalty to individual relationships he has formed. He seems to have a crush on Kalinda Sharma, the firm's investigator. It is later revealed that Cary has a very difficult and distant relationship with his father, Jeffrey Agos, a lobbyist in Washington, D.C., who does not ever seem to think Cary is good enough. As season four ends, after not getting the partnership at Lockhart Gardner that he sought, he forms a new firm bringing with him the other fourth year lawyers at the firm, and manages to convince newly minted Lockhart Gardner partner Alicia to come with them.\n- Archie Panjabi as Kalinda Sharma (seasons 1–6), the firm's in-house investigator. Kalinda previously worked for Peter for three years. He fired her after accusing her of working two jobs. Kalinda is unflappable, inscrutable, fiercely private, and occasionally physically violent. She is exceptionally good at her job, although her tactics are not always strictly legal. She is often the key to the firm's winning a case, usually at the eleventh hour. She generally does not work well with others. Although Kalinda does not let many people close to her, she becomes good friends with Alicia and she feels protective of her. After becoming friends, Alicia finds out Kalinda had a one-night stand with Peter before she knew Alicia, damaging their friendship; over time, the two start to reconcile. Kalinda has a cynical, misanthropic outlook on human behavior. She is openly bisexual and has a series of relationships through the show, mostly with women and often because they can help her with a case. Kalinda once claimed that she prefers women because to her, women are better lovers than men for women understand her needs and feelings better. Very little is known about Kalinda when the series begins, and she is incredibly secretive about her past. The character's signature wardrobe piece has become a pair of knee-high boots;[44][45][46][47] the character initially wore pumps but Panjabi felt that boots \"grounded her in the character\".[48] In Season 4, it is revealed that Kalinda has an estranged abusive husband, Nick Saverese, played by Marc Warren. Kalinda also grows romantically close with Cary. In Season 6, she desperately tries to save Cary from a malicious prosecution on drug-related charges while Alicia is busy running for office, and at a point of desperation, fakes a Brady violation through computer hacking to have Cary's charges dropped. Later, when her deception is caught, she is forced to surrender drug dealer Lemond Bishop to the State's Attorney's office in order to spare Diane from prosecution, as Diane had unknowingly used the fake evidence in court. In order not to be found by Bishop for turning him over to the state's attorney office, Kalinda disappears for her own safety.\n- Graham Phillips as Zachary \"Zach\" Florrick (seasons 1–5; recurring seasons 6–7), the teenage son of Alicia and Peter Florrick. He is the elder of the Florricks' two children, the older brother of Grace Florrick, grandson of Jackie Florrick and Veronica Loy (Alicia's mother), and nephew of Owen Cavanaugh. Zach has an interest in politics, at one point joining Peter's campaign as an intern. Zach is smart, stubborn and also has a strong sense of right and wrong, which has led him to not be afraid of questioning authority figures at times. Zach's computer skills and technical know-how also expose lies that are being spread about his dad. Beyond his computer skills, he shows an aptitude for using the law like his mother. He is protective of his mom because of what his father has put her through. Zach is coping with his parents' separation and starting at a new school and also starting to date. Throughout the series, Zach dates the scheming Becca and later a girl named Neesa who happens to be of Somali origin and whose race and religion are occasionally brought into his father's campaign, which causes some issues. This becomes complicated when his father is released from prison and contemplates a run for office, making his children's life political fodder, despite their mother's best efforts. Zach eventually goes to Georgetown University.\n- Makenzie Vega as Grace Florrick, the teenage daughter of Alicia and Peter Florrick. She is the younger of the Florricks' two children, the younger sister of Zach Florrick, granddaughter of Jackie Florrick and also Veronica Loy (Alicia's mother), and niece of Owen Cavanaugh. Although pretty and compassionate, she is friendless, which is most likely due to her personality. She begins to become deeply religious, thanks to a friend at school, much to her mother's bemusement, and Alicia tries to be supportive in spite of her own atheist outlook. Grace is naïve and young for her age. She has a tutor, Jennifer, who likes to bust out dancing in public. She has many questions about her father's infidelity, which she does not understand. She previously idolized her father, and despite his sins, she wants her parents to get back together. Grace was not happy about the move from their house in Highland Park to their apartment, and initially struggles to make friends in school. In the final season, she provides clerical support for her mom when Alicia starts a new legal business out of their apartment.\n- Josh Charles as Will Gardner (seasons 1–5; guest seasons 6–7), a name partner at Stern, Lockhart &amp;amp; Gardner. An old friend of Alicia's, in the pilot he helped her get a job with the firm and is constantly trying to avoid appearing as if he favors her. This is complicated by the fact that the two have feelings for each other. Will and Alicia have an affair beginning at the end of season two. In season three they break up when Alicia's daughter goes missing, and Alicia decides she needs to focus more on her children. He is seen as very much of a ladies' man throughout the series and had various love affairs and girlfriends. Will generally had a good working relationship with Diane Lockhart, his co-managing partner at the firm, and the two demonstrate a shrewd ability to guide their business, even through difficult times. Will plays in a regular pick-up basketball game with other attorneys and judges, and has friendships with the players that are eventually scrutinized. During season three, Will is suspended from practicing law for six months as punishment stemming from an old bribery scandal but returns to the firm in season four. In season five after much planning, Alicia and Cary leave Lockhart &amp;amp; Gardner to start their own firm; Will takes this betrayal personally. In episode 15 of the fifth season, he is shot and killed in the courtroom by his client Jeffrey Grant (played by Hunter Parrish).\n- Christine Baranski as Diane Lockhart, a name partner at the firm: She is liberal and is a champion of women's causes. A photo in her office shows her with Hillary Clinton.[49] She has strong opinions on many issues, including on guns and violence. She speaks fluent French and seems to have an active social life. Among her paramours is Kurt McVeigh, a firearms expert and conservative Republican, whom Diane is drawn to despite their political opposites and her dislike of guns, and they eventually marry. Although she is initially skeptical of Alicia Florrick's abilities as a lawyer when she joins the firm, Diane becomes a sort of mentor to her. But she is a mentor at a distance, and her support often comes by way of cryptic advice that only points Alicia in the right direction. She does not hesitate to tell anyone when she thinks they are wrong. Diane is often torn between supporting Alicia and Cary Agos when the two are in competition.\n- Alan Cumming as Eli Gold (seasons 2–7; recurring season 1), Peter Florrick's campaign strategist and crisis manager. Eli consults for Peter when he considers a return to office. His style of management is to be blunt, often rude. Eli is politically astute and does not waste time with niceties. Eli is separated from his wife, Vanessa Gold, who has political aspirations of her own, and has a daughter, Marissa, who is similarly outspoken like her mother and shares a healthy relationship with her father. Eli believes that securing the support of Peter's wife Alicia is crucial to any ambitions he may harbor, and he quickly realizes that Alicia is no pushover and his usual wife-coddling techniques will not work. He mostly seems to respect the boundaries Alicia sets up, particularly where they concern her children Zach and Grace. As a top political consultant who is also an expert in damage control, Eli has talks with Diane Lockhart and Will Gardner about joining their firm in some way. Eli seems genuinely invested in Peter Florrick and respects both him and Alicia, although she is often a frustrating enigma to him. He has a brief shot at romance with Natalie Flores, a student who worked in the past as a nanny for Wendy Scott-Carr. Eli leaks details to the press of Natalie's status as an illegal immigrant but as he comes to know her he is seen to regret this and later helps her get a job as an intern at Lockhart &amp;amp; Gardner. Cumming's portrayal of Gold has been compared to Rahm Emanuel.[50] He became a main character in season two.[51] Eli is Jewish, but not very religious. He does, however, request the Sabbath off. In season 5 Peter asks him to be his chief of staff, which position Eli accepts.\n- Zach Grenier as David Lee (seasons 5–7; recurring seasons 1–4), head of Family Law, a divorce lawyer, and an equity partner at Lockhart Gardner. The Family Law division is responsible for a sizeable chunk of the firm's income, so David has more sway than Diane or Will would like. David is misanthropic and is prone to scowling, sarcasm and being directly rude to people when he thinks things are not going his way. More than anything, he is unambiguously concerned with making money. He particularly hates Julius Cain, the firm's head of litigation and an equity partner. Nevertheless, at rare moments, Alicia Florrick turns to him for help and he comes through. Although no easy judge of character, he has a liking for Alicia's mother, and sporadically asks Alicia about her. After recurring in the first four seasons, he was promoted to a series regular for the fifth season.\n- Matthew Goode as Finley \"Finn\" Polmar (seasons 5–6). Introduced in the fifteenth episode of the fifth season, Finn Polmar is the Assistant State's Attorney who prosecuted Jeffrey Grant (played by Hunter Parrish) who was being defended by Will Gardner. During a shooting in the courtroom, Finn is wounded pulling a dying Will to safety. As Finn recovers from his injuries, Alicia later seeks him out looking for answers after Will's death, and even acts as Finn's lawyer when the State's Attorney's Office tries to scapegoat him. In the sixth season, he is the Assistant State's Attorney up against Florrick-Agos, trying to take down one of their top clients, drug kingpin Lemond Bishop (played by Mike Colter). Finn leaves the State's Attorney office midway through the sixth season to start his own practice, and he represents Alicia in exit negotiations with Cary and Diane, though he declines Alicia's invitation to work with her. Finn's sister died of a drug overdose, he is divorced, and has a son. At one point Finn confides in Alicia that he and his wife had a miscarriage. Finn's character was intended to help fill the gap Will's death left behind, but he left the show after season six.[52][53]\n- Cush Jumbo as Lucca Quinn (season 7). A bond court attorney who Alicia encounters at the start of the seventh season. They soon become business partners and develop a close friendship.[54]\n- Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Jason Crouse (season 7).

The firm's top litigator and other partner, Diane Lockhart, likes Alicia's work and her connections, so she and Will award her with a full-time associate position following a trial period. Alicia beats out Cary Agos, a clever young attorney who takes a job in the state's attorney's office, now bitter and vengeful. Alicia finds an ally and a friend in Kalinda, the firm's tough and mysterious in-house investigator. Gaining confidence every day, Alicia transforms herself from embarrassed politician's scorned wife to resilient career woman, especially for the sake of providing a stable home for her children, 14-year-old Zach and 13-year-old Grace. Now that Peter is back home and planning to run for office again with help from Eli Gold, his cunning image consultant, Alicia continues to redefine herself and her role in her family's life.[12]\n\n### Season 2\n\nSeason two begins where season one left off, with Will confessing his affection for Alicia and Alicia asking if he has a plan. Before the plan is conceived, however, Eli Gold takes possession of Alicia's phone and deletes a pivotal voicemail. Alicia, now under the impression that Will has lost interest in her, suppresses her feelings for Will, and the workplace environment becomes awkward when they are in vicinity of each other. With Alicia as a 2nd year associate after being chosen over Cary Agos, who has now been hired as a Deputy State's Attorney leading to Lockhart &amp; Gardner, they often find themselves battling each other in court. Peter, now released from prison and cleared of charges, begins his campaign to run as State's Attorney against current State's Attorney Glenn Childs. A new main partner, Derrick Bond, joins the firm Lockhart &amp; Gardner—now known as Lockhart Gardner &amp; Bond. However, a feud between Diane and Will occurs when Will begins siding with Derrick Bond's suggestions. Diane requests Kalinda to check into Will's and Derrick's past. She discovers that they had a connection in Will's old law firm in Baltimore. At the same time, a new investigator joins the law firm—Blake Calamar. Brought in by Derrick Bond, he is determined to uncover Kalinda's past. When Will discovers that Bond has also been deceiving him, Will and Diane work together to remove Bond as a main partner, but wait until Bond brings in a \"super PAC\" (political action committee) client worth $100 million a year. Blake and Alicia feud, and Blake eventually uncovers that Kalinda had changed her name from \"Leela\" and that Leela slept with Peter Florrick when she used to work for him in the State's Attorney's office. Alicia finds out about the affair on the night that Peter wins the election for State's Attorney. Now separated from Peter, she develops stronger feelings for Will and begins a sexual relationship with him.\n\n### Season 3\n\nSeason three takes place the following morning after season two with Alicia now as a third year litigator on track to become partner while having an affair with her boss Will Gardner. She is given an office on the 29th floor, the only third year litigator with an office on that floor. Peter Florrick's crisis manager Eli Gold joins the firm to prepare for Peter's campaign for governorship of Illinois, while Alicia acts as a bridge between Lockhart &amp; Gardner and his campaign. Peter, now as State's Attorney, battles with Lockhart &amp; Gardner from case to case while the firm begins to get a short-term liquidity problem. Diane and Will try to acquire a bankruptcy department from a competing law firm that is closing down due to the double dip recession, and they notice that a bankruptcy department is the only area that will survive a double dip recession. When Diane tries lobbying to become the State's Attorney's Civil Defender, she begins to suspect an affair between Will and Alicia. The affair, however, ends by mid-season after Alicia realizes she has been putting her needs before those of her children. The second half of the season focuses on Will Gardner being indicted for a crime he committed in his old law firm and ultimately being suspended for six months. Peter decides to run for governor of Illinois and Kalinda's past comes back as it is revealed she has a husband who is searching for her.\n\n### Season 4\n\nSeason four focuses on Lockhart &amp; Gardner's efforts to come out from bankruptcy after rival lawyers Louis Canning and Patti Nyholm team up to take them down. A trustee, Clarke Hayden, is appointed to watch over the firm, but Will and Diane are not happy once he starts getting in their way. Trying to gain money, the firm offers partnership to some associates, because they need their initial payment. When the debt is cleared, only Alicia is made partner and the other offers are delayed. Feeling angry, Cary teams up with the other fourth-years to start a new firm. Peter Florrick runs for governor. Eli is once again leading his campaign, although things get complicated when he finds out he is being investigated. Alicia befriends Maddie Hayward, who sponsors her husband's campaign, but ultimately it turns out she is running up against him and Mike Kresteva. Kalinda's past comes to haunt her in the form of her husband Nick. Once he starts threatening people in her life, she needs to get rid of him. The firm also hires a new investigator to help her at work – Robyn Burdine. On top of all, Alicia is back with Peter, but having a hard time suppressing her feelings for Will. Season 4 ends with Peter Florrick winning the race as governor of Illinois and Alicia deciding to quit Lockhart Gardner and join Cary Agos in forming a new firm.\n\n### Season 5\n\nSeason five takes place after Alicia joins Cary in opening a new firm. They take some of Lockhart Gardner's (now known as LG) clients, but they need to survive under the fierce backlash of their ex-employers. After winning the elections, Peter is now governor. Eli is his chief of staff and is having some problems with Marylin Garbanza, director of the governor's Ethics Commission. Meanwhile, the investigation of a ballot box, full of fake votes for Peter, may ruin his career. At the end of episode 15, Will Gardner is fatally shot in a courtroom by his client. This had a tremendous effect on many of the characters, particularly Alicia, Diane and Kalinda, all of whom reconsidered the course of their respective careers following his death. Finn Polmar was also introduced as a new ASA who befriends Alicia. Alicia decides to split up with Peter but will stay married in the public eye, as it benefits both of their careers. Louis Canning joins Lockhart Gardner as a partner and keeps Will's name on the letterhead, making the firm \"Lockhart Gardner and Canning\"; he and David Lee plot to kick Diane out of the firm. At the end of Season 5, Diane asks if she could join Florrick Agos with her $38 million in clients. Zach goes away to college and Eli asks Alicia if she would run for State's Attorney.\n\n### Season 6\n\nSeason six begins with Cary getting arrested having been charged with helping traffic $1.3 million worth of heroin. Diane's offer to join Florrick Agos stands on the condition she gets an equal vote with Alicia and Cary. David Lee and Louis Canning get suspicious of Diane when she declares her intention to retire. Against Alicia's wishes, Eli conducts polling on a potential campaign for the State's Attorney office for Alicia and discovers that she has a very good chance of winning against the incumbent. With Cary in jail, Diane joins Florrick Agos to form Florrick, Agos &amp; Lockhart. Cary is let out on bail but, when he inadvertently violates the conditions of his bail by going to an out-of-state college reunion, the terms of his bail are revised and he is not allowed within 30 feet of Kalinda. An FBI wiretap reveals that Lemond Bishop plans to assassinate Cary because he fears Cary might turn. Bishop also pressures Kalinda into spying on her lover, Lana Delany. When all seems lost at his trial Cary takes a 4-year plea deal, but he's later cleared of all charges due, in part, to evidence that Kalinda tampers with. Diane finds a provision in the Lockhart, Gardner &amp; Canning office building contract and, in a hostile takeover, evicts Canning and Lee, enabling Florrick, Agos &amp; Lockhart to move in. Alicia Florrick wins the race for the State's Attorney's office over her competition, talkshow personality Frank Prady. Florrick, Agos &amp; Lockhart are attacked by hackers and five years of emails are leaked online in retaliation for their participation in a piracy case. Alicia is interviewed by journalist Petra Moritz in a post-election \"puff piece\" where she, unsuccessfully, tries to exploit Alicia's past with Will via the hacked emails. When Alicia and Peter work together to thwart the bad press, Petra alleges that Alicia committed voter fraud by rigging voting machines. Alicia is then forced to resign as State's Attorney by the Democratic Party to divert attention away from the fact that the voting machines were rigged to protect a more important Democratic candidate and ensure the party's super majority in the state senate. Andrew Wiley investigates the state's attorney's Brady violation against Cary and discovers Kalinda's fake evidence. Using the fraudulent evidence in Cary's case as leverage, Geneva Pine takes advantage of their affection for each other by separately pressuring Kalinda and Cary to get evidence against Bishop. Kalinda successfully copies information from Bishop's computer onto a flash drive and attempts to frame a high-ranking member of Bishop's crew. Bishop is arrested, but his associates realize that Kalinda was responsible. In danger, she says goodbye to Cary and Diane and leaves a note for Alicia. Cary then goes to Kalinda's apartment and finds it completely cleared out and ransacked. Kalinda is on the run.\n\n### Season 7\n\nSeason seven begins with Alicia resisting going to work with Louis Canning and deciding to let Peter run for vice-president (as Hillary Clinton's running mate). Eli hires Ruth Eastman (Margo Martindale); however, she becomes Peter's campaign officer, leaving Eli out. Alicia, taking cases by herself, hires private investigator Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in Kalinda's absence. Alicia finds a new ally in bar attorney Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) and the two become friends, sharing cases. In the latter part of the season, Peter gets investigated for another corruption charge involving murder during his second term as State's Attorney by Assistant U.S. Attorney Connor Fox. Peter hires Elsbeth Tascioni's ex-husband Mike Tascioni after noting a conflict of interest. As Alicia throws a house party for Peter's mother, Jackie Florrick, Mike drops out, leaving Diane to represent Peter in his trial. Alicia asks Peter for a divorce and he agrees to it, once his trial is over. After Jason tells Alicia she will never divorce Peter if he goes to jail, Alicia focuses all her efforts on proving Peter's innocence, especially when Grace tells her she won't go to college if her father gets arrested. Alicia discovers a way to prove Peter's innocence by discrediting Diane's husband Kurt McVeigh after he made a mistake on the case when analyzing the guns used in the murder. After an argument with Diane, Alicia convinces Lucca to cross examine him on the stand, alluding to Kurt's indiscretions and infidelity leaving Diane humiliated. Eli begins moving political donors away from Peter, noting that it was Alicia all along who has real political potential even after a failed State's Attorney campaign. Peter is offered and takes a deal where he doesn't have to go to prison, but must resign from office as governor; he also begins divorce proceedings with Alicia but asks her to stand by his side one last time as he resigns from office. At his press conference, Alicia thinks she sees Jason waiting for her in a hallway and as soon the press conference finishes, walks off immediately, leaving Peter behind. After finding out it wasn't Jason waiting for her, Alicia is approached by Diane, who slaps her and walks off. Alicia is left alone in the hallway before fixing herself up and wiping away tears.\n\n## Technology and the Internet\n\nThe Good Wife has been well received among technology enthusiasts, being described by Clive Thompson of Wired as \"the most tech-savvy show on TV\".[66] The show has explored the relationship between technology and the law, covering topics including Bitcoin, Anonymous, viral marketing in political campaigns, voice control software, crisis management in the controversial AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger, virtual conferencing robots, and NSA surveillance. For example, one of the firm's recurring clients is a fictional internet search company known as ChumHum, which among other issues has faced privacy lawsuits for selling users' personal data to the Chinese and Syrian government. The Good Wife was the first TV show to feature Bitcoin, the virtual internet currency, with an episode featuring Bitcoin first broadcast in January 2012.[67] This led to it achieving a high level of fame amongst the Bitcoin community.[68][69]\n\nIn the season five premiere, a Double Robotics robot was featured on the show which allowed a litigator to teleconference from home by controlling a tablet on wheels. However, rather than glorifying the robot's features, The Good Wife turned it into a punchline with practical jokes and problems the robot could have such as it not being able to maneuver around an office and bumping into walls, doors, and people and low Wi-Fi connectivity leading to buffering and loss of visual and voice communication of the person working at home.[70] In season five episode nine, \"Whack-a-Mole,\" The Good Wife featured a version of Reddit called \"Scabbit\" and how it affects the law and the downsides of having an \"average joe\" being an investigator trying to find a domestic terrorist. It also deals with injunctions of taking down a defamatory web page on \"Scabbit\" but having another similar web page pop up soon after. In season five episode eleven, \"Goliath and David,\" the story is based around a TV show Drama Camp who stole an indie band's cover of a rap song and deals with the legality of copyright infringement. It was inspired by Jonathan Coulton who created a cover of \"Baby Got Back\" and Glee, the TV series, which used an identical cover on the show. The character Robyn Burdine, a private investigator for Florrick/Agos, discovers that the show Drama Camp had to release the song on iTunes in Sweden before releasing it in the US and that the engineers directly ripped the indie band's track constituting actual theft.\n\nIn season six episode two, the show tackles employee poaching in the workplace for social media companies and employee wage-fixing by The Good Wife's Google stand-in \"ChumHum\" and how they worked with other companies to fix employees' salaries. In season six episode five, Florrick, Agos and Lockhart deal with ransomware on the office computers. In season six episode fifteen, the episode revolves around the case of a 3D printed gun that misfired and hit an innocent bystander. It takes an in-depth look at 3D printing and how modifications to CAD design, the printer model being used, and the environment a 3D printer is being used in can affect how an object is created and second amendment laws for downloadable firearms. In season six episode seventeen, \"Undisclosed Recipients\", the law firm's email system gets hacked as retaliation for a case with a movie studio suing \"Wharf Master\", the show's stand in for an illegal torrenting website. This begins an arc when the hackers forward further emails to Petra Morris, a journalist who is making a puff piece about Alicia Florrick's recent win for state's attorney. This leads to a voter fraud conspiracy resulting in an innocent Alicia withdrawing her name from contention for the State's Attorney's office.\n\nSeason seven dealt with topics such as self-driving cars, Google's racial facial detection, racial bias in online mapping applications, and the NSA. Season seven episode fourteen deals with a case mirroring the missing iPhone Four prototype with a ChumHum iPad-like tablet. Season seven episode eighteen deals with the topic of regulating the use of drones and its impact on privacy versus commerce discussions.\n\n## Reception\n\nThe New York Times says that The Good Wife \"stands out among newer fall shows\" and that it is \"miles ahead of anything else that's on at the moment\".[71] In reviewing the earlier episodes many critics praised the acting. The Chicago Tribune said: \"one of the best parts of the show is Alicia's complicated relationship with her husband, who humiliated his family with a sex scandal but also appears to be a pawn in a larger game being played by high-level politicians\".[72] The New York Daily News said, \"Margulies puts a powerful combination of cold fury, bewilderment and tenacity into Alicia Florrick, the wife of a disgraced Chicago politician in a new series that readily admits it ripped itself from the headlines\"[73] while The Baltimore Sun predicted that \"With all four [actors] bringing their 'A' games to the pilot, it looks as if CBS could have another winning 10 o'clock drama.\" There were a few reservations as to the long-term success and plot of the show, with the San Francisco Chronicle concluding that \"There's nothing inherently wrong with The Good Wife other than it's a legal series with too many close-up shots of knowing glances and 'attagirl Alicia' moments of empowerment that you saw coming 20 minutes prior.\"[74] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 TV Series of 2010[75] and 2011, saying, \"The ability to keep growing: that's what makes a good Wife great.\"[76] The Salt Lake Tribune in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked The Good Wife No. 3, explaining \"The mix of fascinating legal drama and even more fascinating personal drama is superb.\"[77]\n\nVerne Gay of Newsday said, \"Like Mad Men, Wife has an obsessive attention to detail; it's a hurricane of detail, in the visual touches, legal patter and the actors' unspoken flourishes. Nothing seems extraneous or out of place. Also like Men, this show cares as much about silence as words, or that which isn't said (also a form of eloquence).\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said: \"The series also feels impeccably researched and lived-in, just as The Wire did. The Good Wife may not seem like the logical successor to The Wire on the surface, but it's revealed itself to be a series nearly as complex, humane, and deep as that earlier show, and all in reduced network running-times with heightened restrictions on content.\"[78] Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian wrote: \"But as the 100th episode – part of a near-flawless season five – shows, The Good Wife is uncommonly good. If you're looking for a quality drama box set to escape the family this Christmas, look no further. It has no smoking, brooding male anti-hero, and it's not a period piece, but The Good Wife is exciting and smart and underrated\".[79] The Guardian referred to The Good Wife as a \"miracle of the small screen\" that was \"not really seen on that scale since the days of Cagney and Lacey\".[80]\n\nAs a broadcast network television show which is usually stigmatised compared to its cable competitors, it has received what is considered unusual acclaim: USA Today said that The Good Wife is \"broadcast's best drama\", while The Atlantic said that the show \"is delivering the best drama on network television\".[81][82] TIME referred to it as \"the best thing on TV outside cable\".[83] TV critic Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker compared Alicia Florrick, the show's protagonist, to Walter White of Breaking Bad.[84] Esquire called The Good Wife \"The Best Show on Television Right Now (Both Network and Cable),\" claiming that the season five episodes \"Hitting The Fan\" and \"The Next Day\" were possibly the best television episodes produced that year, noting, \"It's a rare show that starts to come into its own in the middle of its fifth season, but somehow CBS's The Good Wife has managed to do it.\"[85] Chancellor Agard of The Daily Beast said, \"'Hitting the Fan' is so momentous because of the degree to which it contrasts with last week's equally excellent episode, 'Outside the Bubble.'\"[86] Don Kaplan of the New York Daily News said, \"Now the drama's in its fifth season, a time when most shows either go on autopilot or start offering \"very special\" shark-jumping episodes. But the producers and cast of Wife somehow managed to kick over the chessboard where the show has been played for years, scattering the pieces to the wind and reinventing The Good Wife as one of the most gripping dramas on television. Period.\"[87] It was named the Favorite Current TV Show by the Harris Poll.[88] In 2013, TV Guide ranked the series #59 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[89]\n\nRolling Stone described seasons six and seven as a \"study in sprawl, with dozens of stranded characters and dead-end storylines: Alicia spent the show's sixth season running for political office only to end up right back where she started\". Salon stated that season six \"fell apart, seemingly overnight in the latter part of the season. On the eve of the finale, it's hard to tell what this season has been about: We watched an election, a stint in prison, an investigation of a drug dealer, and the aftereffects of voter fraud, but it has been difficult to assemble the events into a cohesive narrative.\"[90] Season seven has received criticism for the \"incredibly uneven [plotting], sucking so much of the vitality and urgency out of the show\". Variety noted that in season seven that \"there were notably more of subplots and segues that were, at best, time-fillers and at worst, eyeroll-inducing\" and said it \"was obvious that it was time for the show to go\".[91] TV.com observed that \"obituaries for the show were already burying it instead of praising it, pointing to where it all went wrong, or that it wasn't even truly that great to begin with. An episode like 'End' solidified a lot of those arguments.\"[92] The New York Times opined that season seven \"never sparkled or caught fire the way the series did in its best seasons, when it was broadcast television's leading argument for continued relevance in the peak-TV era. The weekly legal cases — the show was resolutely procedural almost to the end — were still intelligently devised and briskly dispatched, but they felt familiar and not very urgent, and more than ever seemed to be lecturing viewers about current events\", which was further \"pummeled by cast defections and bad decisions\".[93]\n\nThe finale episode of The Good Wife, \"End\", generated a divided reaction among viewers and critics, with many praising it as a fitting ending to a complex character[94][95] with others who argued of its ambiguity and absence of a conclusion – particularly with Alicia's love life. The finale drew controversy in its last scene when Diane Lockhart slaps Alicia Florrick for having betrayed her in court to save Peter from jail. Alicia is then left alone in a hallway before walking away to a future of uncertainty regarding her relationship with Jason, her career, and political life. Vanity Fair noting \"As Breaking Bad famously tracked the evolution of Walter White 'from Mr. Chips to Scarface,' The Good Wife followed Alicia as she evolved into Peter. The Kings claim the show was 'moving in the direction where there wasn't much difference between who Alicia was and who her husband was.' Is Alicia a villain or an anti-hero? It's hard to quite see her that way after all the good she's done for so many seasons. But the inclusion of Will Gardner in the finale momentarily humanizes Alicia while also highlighting the idea that Alicia's transformation into Peter has been a longtime coming,\" and claiming that \"the show's incredible finale belongs to an earlier age of television.\" Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker said \"it was an ending that commanded respect\".[96]\n\nThe ensemble cast of The Good Wife had been praised as \"one of the best casts in television, and it was supplemented with an awe-inspiring array of guest stars — one way for the Kings to flaunt the advantages of a network budget. Half the cast of The Wire passed through its halls, as did more Broadway stars than there are in heaven\", although at the end of the series the guest stars were increasingly placed in \"throwaway roles\".[97] However, with the exit of male lead Josh Charles (who played Will Gardner) in season five, Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya of The A.V. Club opined that the show's \"writers really struggled to rebuild that same type of long-term emotional storytelling. His departure left a gap that was never fully filled again.\"[98] While reviewers acknowledged that Charles's departure was inevitable (and praised how Will was written off dramatically),[99] they questioned decisions made by the writers for seasons six and seven that further hurt the show. Archie Panjabi's portrayal of Kalinda Sharma was well-regarded during the first three seasons, but Sonia Saraiya of Salon felt that her character ended up sidelined by a much-criticized plotline in seasons four to six, amid a rumored rift between Panjabi and producer Julianna Margulies where they did not share any screen time for their final 50 episodes.[90] In season seven, longtime stalwarts like Cary Agos and Diane Lockhart were reportedly[according to whom?] marginalized to irrelevance with a lack of compelling storylines, in favor of promoting new characters like Lucca Quinn and Jason Crouse.\n\nHillary Clinton has said she enjoyed watching the show.[100][101][102]\n\nIn a 2024 article, Vulture looked back on the shocking nature of Josh Charles' character Will Gardner's death ten years later.[103]\n\n## TV ratings\n\n| Season    | Episodes    | Timeslot (ET)    | Original airing    | Original airing    | Original airing    | Rank    | Viewers (in millions)    |\n|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Season    | Episodes    | Timeslot (ET)    | Season premiere    | Season finale      | TV season          | Rank    | Viewers (in millions)    |\n| 1         | 23          | Tuesday 10:00 pm | September 22, 2009 | May 25, 2010       | 2009–10            | 18      | 13.12[104]               |\n| 2         | 23          | Tuesday 10:00 pm | September 28, 2010 | May 17, 2011       | 2010–11            | 16      | 13.00[105]               |\n| 3         | 22          | Sunday 9:00 pm   | September 25, 2011 | April 29, 2012     | 2011–12            | 26      | 11.83[106]               |\n| 4         | 22          | Sunday 9:00 pm   | September 30, 2012 | April 28, 2013     | 2012–13            | 27      | 10.98[107]               |\n| 5         | 22          | Sunday 9:00 pm   | September 29, 2013 | May 18, 2014       | 2013–14            | 23      | 11.43[108]               |\n| 6         | 22          | Sunday 9:00 pm   | September 21, 2014 | May 10, 2015       | 2014–15            | 22      | 12.17[109]               |\n| 7         | 22          | Sunday 9:00 pm   | October 4, 2015    | May 8, 2016        | 2015–16            | 27      | 10.84[110]               |\n\n### DVR ratings\n\nSeason Averages in Live+7 DVR Ratings:\n\n- season 1: 14 million viewers|DVR ratings: million [111]\n- season 2: 14.059 million viewers|DVR ratings: 2.257 million [112]\n- season 3: 12.100 million viewers|DVR ratings: 1.880 million [113]\n- season 4: 11.523 million viewers|DVR ratings: 2.075 million [114]\n- season 5: 12. million viewers|DVR ratings: million [115]\n- season 6: 12.268 million |DVR ratings: 2.522 million [ 116]\n    - 2013: With 11.7 million viewers, the series ranks at No. 36 among American TV primetime series.

Hulu Plus rolled out previous seasons of the show in September 2013, while Hallmark Channel, which reportedly paid $350,000 and $400,000 per episode,[123] began airing The Good Wife in January 2014. However, not long after premiering on the Hallmark Channel the show was pulled from the schedule.[124] A weekend broadcast syndication run is scheduled to begin in September 2014, with the series sold in 85% of the country.[125][126] The show received an average of 331,000 viewers on Hallmark Channel.[127]\n\nSince 2018, the show has re-aired on the Start TV channel.[128][129] Pluto TV added a Good Wife-themed free ad-supported channel in October 2024,[130] with selected seasons also available on demand.[131] The full series has been made available on Paramount+.[132]\n\n### International\n\n- In the United Kingdom, Channel 4 began airing The Good Wife on January 25, 2010. The series was later moved to More4 due to a drop in ratings during the first season. The network aired seasons two to six. The seventh season premiered in January 2016.[133]\n- In China, online video streaming websites Youku and Sohu had licensed the series until a government ban forced them to remove the show from their websites in April 2014. According to Julianna Margulies, the ban was due to an episode regarding NSA espionnage.[134][135][136]\n\n## Spin-offs\n\n### The Good Fight\n\nMichelle and Robert King stated in February 2016 that there was a possibility for a spin-off series.[137] By May, CBS was in final negotiations to set up a spin-off, featuring Christine Baranski reprising her role as Diane Lockhart, that would air on streaming service CBS All Access instead of the network,[138] and it was officially ordered to series on May 18 with Cush Jumbo returning as well.[139]\n\nIn September 2016, it was confirmed that the 10-episode series would premiere in February 2017. The story picks up a year after the final episode of the original series, with Diane pushed out of her firm after a financial scam wipes out her savings, resulting in her move to Lucca Quinn's firm. Sarah Steele was also added to the cast, returning as Marissa Gold and appearing as Diane Lockhart's secretary-turned-investigator.[140][141] In October 2016, former Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie was confirmed to play the role of Diane's goddaughter Maia, and Delroy Lindo was added as Adrian Boseman.[142][143] Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters were cast as Maia's parents.[144] The series' title The Good Fight was announced on October 31, 2016.[145]\n\n### Elsbeth\n\nOn January 31, 2023, it was announced that CBS had ordered a pilot for a new spin-off series titled Elsbeth, starring Carrie Preston.[146] It was picked up by CBS for the 2023–24 American television season on May 9, 2023.[147] It premiered on February 29, 2024.[148]\n\n## International remakes\n\nThe Good Wife has been adapted or remade in various countries:\n\n- In South Korea, a deal was made between Studio Dragon and CBS International for a localized remake series of The Good Wife. The 16-episode miniseries premiered July 8, 2016, on tvN sharing the same name (Korean translation: 굿 와이프) and premise except the show examines politics and corruption in Seoul rather than in Chicago.[149] The show was highly anticipated because it featured the return of one of Korea's biggest actresses, Jeon Do-yeon, to television after 11 years.[150] It is the first ever American show to be remade in Korea.\n- In Japan, a deal was made with CBS international for a localized remake series of The Good Wife, it premiered in January 2019 on TBS, under the same name (Japanese translation: グッドワイフ).\n- In Russia, Sony Pictures Television produced a localized remake series of The Good Wife.

Emerging from the story are timeless themes: becoming your best self, sisterhood and the bonds of family, and the difficult passage from childhood to adulthood. Beneath the seemingly mundane exploits of the four sisters lurk the deeper themes of the meaning of love and marriage, the relentless drive and cost of ambition, the pain of self-doubt, the devastating experience of death and loss, and grief’s transformative power.\n\nLittle Women has been adapted in many forms, including three major motion pictures and a three-part mini series for PBS. Greta Gerwig’s version reinterprets Alcott’s classic novel for the 21st century, deepening its feminist message with nods to the author’s trail blazing life as a best-selling author. Inspired in part by Louisa May Alcott’s drive to support her family through her writing, Ms. Gerwig focused on the theme of women with relationship to ambition, art, and money.\n\nSaoirse Ronan in Greta Gerwig’s LITTLE WOMEN. Photo credit: Wilson Webb; © 2019 CTMG, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSprinkled throughout the lavish two hour and fifteen minute film are references to women and economy: Meg’s longing for wealth and a large home like her friend, Sally Moffat; Amy’s bold declaration that marrying well was an economic necessity for women (reflecting the thoughts of the wealthy Aunt March); Jo’s drive to sell stories in New York, and using her earnings to help her family, particularly ailing sister Beth.\n\nBTS: Emma Watson and Director/Writer Greta Gerwig on the set of Columbia Pictures’ LITTLE WOMEN.” Photo credit: Wilson Webb; © 2019 CTMG, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMs. Gerwig’s other innovation was to disregard the linear timeline of the story in favor of a thematic approach. As a means of focusing on the sisters as adults, the film employed flashbacks to recall memories which supported the themes. While this approach created a vibrant energy and unpredictability in the storyline, it also proved challenging and confusing, even for viewers who knew Little Women well. The change between present and past was so rapid at times that it was hard to grasp the connecting point between the two.\n\nSuch an approach hampered character development, depriving the story of its emotional depth. The continual back-and-forth in the timeline robbed scenes of their emotional intensity. The buildup, for example, to Beth’s tragic death (a pinnacle moment of the story) was undone in an instant with a time-shift back to Meg’s wedding, showing Beth alive and well.\n\nEliza Scanlen in Columbia Pictures’ LITTLE WOMEN. Photo credit: Wilson Webb; © 2019 CTMG, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile the “heart” of the story was missing at times (the 1994 movie takes care of that aspect beautifully), there was much to engage the mind, and this is where Ms. Gerwig’s version takes its rightful place. She knows what her audience wants and delivers, all the while daring to push the edge of the envelope. After an impassioned speech to her Marmee about the terrible dilemma of loneliness for women who chose to follow their ambition, Jo (inspired by the memory of Beth) threw herself into the writing of the novel of her heart, raising the everyday story of four sisters to the level of art and greater importance. The last thirty minutes of the film was an exhilarating ride, vacillating back and forth between Jo’s mad dash to the railroad station (egged on by her sisters) to catch Professor Bhaer before he leaves for the West, and Jo sitting with publisher Mr. Dashwood, hammering out the ending to her novel called Little Women. In a fitting tribute to Louisa May Alcott, Ms. Gerwig added aspects of Alcott’s own story to the scene. For writers inspired by Jo March, the scenes depicting the writing and printing of her book were particularly gratifying.\n\nSaoirse Ronan in Columbia Pictures’ LITTLE WOMEN. Photo credit: Wilson Webb; © 2019 CTMG, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe casting of the March sisters was excellent. Saoirse Ronan is the quintessential Jo March with all of her creative fire (and anger), along with vulnerability and self-doubt. Emma Watson was a lovely Meg and Eliza Scanlen played a thoughtful and thoroughly human Beth. Florence Pugh nearly stole the show as Amy, bringing a greater depth to a much maligned character, and spicing her performance with touches of humor. There was a genuine sense of affection and camaraderie between the four actresses that created an endearing sisterhood.\n\nSaoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Emma Watson in Columbia Pictures’ LITTLE WOMEN. Photo credit: Wilson Webb; © 2019 CTMG, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTimothée Chalamet was questionable at times as Theodore “Laurie” Laurence, particularly when it came to a romantic chemistry between him and Ms. Ronan. He was, in fact, more persuasive as a future husband to Florence Pugh. Laura Dern was warm and earthy as Marmee, but it was hard to believe she was “angry nearly every day of her life.”\n\nSupporting players Aunt March and Mr. Laurence were played to perfection by Meryl Streep (who brought a tart humor to the formidable character) and Chris Cooper (creating a warm and poignant relationship with Beth). Louis Garrel was a surprisingly sexy Professor Bhaer with far too little screen time.\n\nThe movie sparkled with energy, creativity and beauty, complete with exquisite costumes and historical details. Shot entirely in Massachusetts, settings included the city of Lawrence along with Concord and Harvard, the Arnold Arboretum in Boston and the Crane Estate and beach in Ipswich.\n\nCrane Estate, Wikipedia Commons\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA point of contention was the near total absence of both the spiritual and moral core of Little Women. While today’s viewers may not understand the connection of Little Women with John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress, it should not be difficult to underscore the need for an inner life and the acknowledgement of something beyond ourselves in order to become better people. The movie touched upon this theme with Beth but missed the opportunity to develop it. In an interview with Gabrielle Donnelly (see previous post), Ms. Gerwig shared this insight: “There was such a bent of self-improvement and bettering oneself in books at the time … but the fact is that these days, why we love the characters is not because of how they conquer themselves but because of how they don’t.” Ms. Gerwig does understand her audience. But by focusing exclusively on women with regards to ambition, art and money, the movie neglected the deeper message that a greater use of Beth could have delivered. She did not possess the ambition to use her musical talent for a wider purpose nor did she dream of marrying into money. Acknowledged by Amy as the “best” of the four, Beth quietly gave of herself while reflecting upon the meaning of life and death, a wisdom she somehow imparted to Jo in her last days. This then propelled Jo into creating her greatest piece of writing.\n\nAll that being said, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women is deserving of praise; it is a thought-provoking movie to enjoy, ponder in the aftermath, and then see again.\n\nAre you passionate about\n\nLouisa May Alcott too?\n\nSubscribe to the email list and\n\nnever miss a post!\n\nKeep up with news and free giveaways\n\non Susan’s books,\n\nLouisa May Alcott: Illuminated by The Message,\n\nand River of Grace!\n\nFacebook Louisa May Alcott is My Passion\n\n More About Louisa on Twitter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind Susan’s books here on Amazon • Purchase Susan’s CD.\n\n### Rate this:\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n- Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\n- Click to print (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n## 24 Replies to “Movie Review: Greta Gerwig’s “Little Women” is a thought-provoking and daring take on the classic novel”\n\n- Christine says: .comment-author December 30, 2019 at 9:34 am .comment-metadata .comment-meta I’m one of those who won’t be seeing this film, pretty much for the same reasons I don’t watch dramatizations of the lives of people who are still living or whose lives are well-documented (e.g. recent movies and TV series about members of Britain’s royal family). For me, because the lives of the March sisters are definitively and thought-provokingly documented in Louisa May Alcott’s masterpiece, any re-interpretation only puts barriers between us and them. I have seen the 1933, 1949 and 1994 movies, and all of them left me feeling as though something wonderful had been violated (even though I admired Peter Lawford’s wistful “Laurie” :-). I’ve tried to analyze this reaction, and have concluded that at the end of the day it comes down to this: When you feel you know, or have known, someone, you do not want a fictionalized version of them. I feel that if a creative person admires “Little Women” and wishes to honor it, he or she can best do so by incorporating its enduring themes in a work that is completely original. Thank you for your thoughtful, balanced review of this latest film. .comment-content Reply .comment-body .children\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n- I’m one of those who won’t be seeing this film, pretty much for the same reasons I don’t watch dramatizations of the lives of people who are still living or whose lives are well-documented (e.g. recent movies and TV series about members of  Britain’s royal family).

I admit that I do not feel the same attachment to it because I did not grow up on it. I read it late in life and actually both times I read it I actually listened to it. After this movie, I decided to actually read it! I think though that little bit of distance I feel about the story makes me anxious to see how other people interpret it, and I’ve learned tons about why people feel the way they do about this story.\n\n  Reply\n- QNPoohBear says: .comment-author December 30, 2019 at 2:38 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta While I normally feel the same as Christine, I wanted the movie to do well and was curious about this feminist take on a much-loved story. I also wanted to know if my nieces might enjoy this adaptation. My dad and I went to see it Friday night. (I had to wait two whole days!) He found the non-linear storytelling confusing and thought my nieces would too. I thought they’d be OK if they read the abridged version of the book I gave them but the 1994 movie would be better. Like you I felt the childhood scenes were too rushed and I also missed the emotional connection to Beth. However, my dad cried like a baby, he says… I didn’t miss the spiritual aspect of the novel and felt the moral aspect was covered well enough although it lacked some of Marmee’s wise counsel. I will have a full review on my blog very soon. https://bluestockingmusings.blogspot.com .comment-content Reply .comment-body .children\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n- While I normally feel the same as Christine, I wanted the movie to do well and was curious about this feminist take on a much-loved story.

You hit the nail when you said that Gerwig knows her audience. There is a certain amount of nihilism in this adaptation (which is a current trend) and so was in the pbs series but it´s not something that exists in the book, Alcott meant it to be “pure and not even a bit sensational”. One of my friends who saw the film said that maybe they made a mistake by rereading the book before they went to see the film since then she was constantly comparing the things that we’re missing.\n        - susanwbailey says: \n\nDecember 31, 2019 at 5:44 pm \n\n\nDid you notice too how everyone had to do things all on their own? I particularly noticed in Marmee’s speech to Jo about her anger. In the book she credits Mr March with helping her but in the movie it was just her own strength. Heaven forbid she should credit her husband with any help! And then there was the whole thing about some Noble characters don’t need to be deterred or whatever comment like it’s okay for Jo to have all this rage. Even Jo is smart enough to know that’s not right!\n        - Jill Georgieff Fuller says: \n\nDecember 31, 2019 at 10:43 pm \n\n\nThe quote I think you’re alluding to, Susan, is actually from Abigail’s journals! I just finished them and I remember it jumping out at me since I’d seen that clip online. She writes in 1850: “I believe there are some natures too noble to curb, too lofty to bend. Of such is my Lu.” I interpreted this (in both the journal and the movie) to mean not that it’s OK for Louisa/Jo to be angry, but that she doesn’t want her independent girl to become something she isn’t. Just thought I’d throw that in there!\n        - susanwbailey says: \n\nJanuary 1, 2020 at 7:52 am \n\n\nThank you for clarifying that!\n    - Sundari Singh says: \n\nDecember 6, 2023 at 12:05 am \n\n\nI highly recommend they make the movie into a series, because there  should be scenes of meg and her marriage, Jo’s life style in New York, and Amy’s paintings and life with Laurie.\n\n  Reply\n- dianabirchall says: .comment-author December 30, 2019 at 6:19 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta Thank you for a brilliant review, Susan. I’ve tried and tried to analyze for myself why this movie left me surprisingly cold (although I responded heartily to the 1994 version), but couldn’t put my finger on it. You did. There were anachronisms (Jo goes hatless to interview a publisher? Laurie gets falling down drunk? Public kissing?), but there were some in the 1994 version too, and they didn’t bother me. I thought the scrambled sequencing here was theoretically an interesting, refreshing approach, and of course knowing the story so well I had no trouble following it. But it turned out – as you pinpointed – that the structure really was the problem. You couldn’t be drawn into an emotional scene without slam, bam, it’s seven years earlier (or later). So I felt distanced emotionally…and despite the many beauties and excellences of the production (in particular the costumes, settings, Ronan and Pugh’s performances), I was disappointed. .comment-content Reply .comment-body .children\n- &lt;!-- image --&gt;\n- Thank you for a brilliant review, Susan.

I had to read other negative reviews (and there were only 4 out of 100 on Rotten Tomatoes) in order to figure out why I too felt flat when I saw it the first time. I think Gerwig assumed that the viewers would already know the characters and it would not be necessary to build backstories. But what she failed to take into account is that when you encounter actors playing these characters you have to get used to them playing the characters and then you build a relationship. I had to see the movie twice in order to build those relationships. But I still didn’t feel the emotional reaction that I felt with the 1994 movie. .comment-content Reply .comment-body .children\n    - &amp;lt;!-- image --&amp;gt;\n    - In all honesty, I can’t really take full credit for that insight.

I think people are reluctant to give them because they’re so pleased to see a young woman director and a strong woman themed movie, plus there are plenty of wonderful things about it. Fine performances, gorgeous settings, what’s not to love? But if love does not come, because of a clunky misexecution in structure, I think it’s important to point out that fault. It’s not a reason to hate or not to see the movie, but it needs to be said.\n        - susanwbailey says: \n\nDecember 30, 2019 at 7:40 pm \n\n\nExactly!\n- Susan says: .comment-author December 31, 2019 at 8:00 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta I was also disappointed by the film–despite the fine acting and the high production values, the movie felt very flat to me.

And there’s no better person to write it than Susan Bailey.” Lori Erickson, The Holy Rover on Patheos\n\n“I never fully realized how much spiritual content is integrated into her body of work.

Emerging from the story are timeless themes: becoming your best self, sisterhood and the bonds of family, and the difficult passage from childhood to adulthood. Beneath the seemingly mundane exploits of the four sisters lurk the deeper themes of the meaning of love and marriage, the relentless drive and cost of ambition, the pain of self-doubt, the devastating experience of death and loss, and grief’s transformative power.</p>\n            <p>Little Women has been adapted in many forms, including three major motion pictures and a three-part mini series for PBS. Greta Gerwig’s version reinterprets Alcott’s classic novel for the 21st century, deepening its feminist message with nods to the author’s trailblazing life as a best-selling author. Inspired in part by Louisa May Alcott’s drive to support her family through her writing, Ms. Gerwig focused on the theme of women with relationship to ambition, art, and money.</p>\n            <p>Sprinkled throughout the lavish two hour and fifteen minute film are references to women and economy: Meg’s longing for wealth and a large home like her friend, Sally Moffat; Amy’s bold declaration that marrying well was an economic necessity for women (reflecting the thoughts of the wealthy Aunt March); Jo’s drive to sell stories in New York, and using her earnings to help her family, particularly ailing sister Beth.</p>\n            <p>Ms. Gerwig’s other innovation was to disregard the linear timeline of the story in favor of a thematic approach. As a means of focusing on the sisters as adults, the film employed flashbacks to recall memories which supported the themes. While this approach created a vibrant energy and unpredictability in the storyline, it also proved challenging and confusing, even for viewers who knew <i>Little Women</i> well.</p>\n            <p>Such an approach hampered character development, depriving the story of its emotional depth. The continual back-and-forth in the timeline robbed scenes of their emotional intensity. The buildup, for example, to Beth’s tragic death (a pinnacle moment of the story) was undone in an instant with a time-shift back to Meg’s wedding, showing Beth alive and well.</p>\n            <p>While the “heart” of the story was missing at times, there was much to engage the mind, and this is where Ms. Gerwig’s version takes its rightful place. After an impassioned speech to her Marmee about the terrible dilemma of loneliness for women who chose to follow their ambition, Jo (inspired by the memory of Beth) threw herself into the writing of the novel of her heart, raising the everyday story of four sisters to the level of art and greater importance.</p>\n            <p>The casting of the March sisters was excellent. Saoirse Ronan is the quintessential Jo March with all of her creative fire (and anger), along with vulnerability and self-doubt. Emma Watson was a lovely Meg and Eliza Scanlen played a thoughtful and thoroughly human Beth.

This season, Designated Survivor: 60 Days is that show, for me.\n\nPersonally, I don’t have a strong interest in politics, and therefore, I’ve always thought that political shows wouldn’t be my thing, which is why I didn’t think to check out this show, when it first aired earlier this year.\n\nBut, because I recently really enjoyed Son Seok Koo in Be Melodramatic, and also because I do have a soft spot for Ji Jin Hee, I decided to try this one, just to see, and – I’m kinda shocked, actually, by how much I liked it. Talk about a drama tilting your world, eh?\n\nSTUFF I LIKED\n\nShow is accessible, emotionally engaging and well-paced\n\nGiven that political stories are the kind of things that I never imagined myself getting into, I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely intrigued episode 1 left me, and then happily shocked at how much I liked this show, by episode 2.\n\nIn fact, this quickly rose to the top of the batch of dramas I was watching at the time; this was the show that I most looked forward to another episode of. Woah, right?\n\nThe main threads\n\nOn the one hand, there’s the on-going investigation that tries to uncover the truth behind the bombing, which Show mostly manages with a tight hand.\n\nOur agents learn new information steadily, but it’s always in fragments, and the mystery behind what it all means, is one hook of this tale.\n\nAt the same time, there’s the whole question of how our shocked, blindsided new Acting President is going to survive this, and make his own mark on the world.\n\nIt’s immediately apparent that Park Moo Jin (Ji Hin Hee) is not politically savvy; he’s genuinely interested in making the world a better place for the people who live in it; he sincerely wants to do the honest and right thing.\n\nWe also see that oftentimes, the people around him do not agree with his way of doing things.\n\nBased on that alone, I felt that it would be interesting to see what kind of President he becomes, now that the role is thrust upon him.\n\nThe accessibility\n\nI do have to credit Show with making all the politics and accompanying politicking accessible to even a political noob like me.\n\nIn some ways, this story gave me a few sageuk vibes.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nThe different parties fighting for political power; the idea of soldiers dying in vain for a country that doesn’t know or care, and the possible revenge thread that comes out of that; ruthless measures being taken to silence people; people getting killed before they are able to give any information; people getting threatened into making false confessions of murder.\n\nIt all smells somewhat like a sageuk.\n\n[END SPOILERS]\n\nAnd since I’ve had a fair amount of experience with sageuks, this helped me feel like I was kinda-sorta on familiar ground.\n\nIt’s compelling\n\nI have to give it to Show, generally speaking, this story feels strong and well-paced. Our narrative gets time to ebb and flow, and we do get time to breathe in between more exciting portions of the plot, and Show knows how to keep my attention, through it all.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nIn episode 3, the daunting task before Moo Jin becoming more faceted and full of hidden consequences than he’d anticipated; the sometimes surprising opposition he faces for wanting to do the thing that his conscience tells him is right.\n\nThe overwhelming amount of disparate information being thrown at him from all sides; the shifting realization that underneath all the political talk about policy, are real people with real fears.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nIt all comes together to be compelling and engaging, and even rather educational, all at once.\n\nAs a bonus, I thought the music for this show was well-selected and applied. It’s dramatic and orchestral, and adds a nice flavor of dramatic tension to scenes. I liked that.\n\nIt’s emotionally engaging\n\nThe biggest thing for me, is that Show makes this watch an emotional experience, rather than a purely cerebral one.\n\nShow invests a good amount of its breathing time in building the more emotional sides of its story, which I feel serves the narrative well, because this helps to round out our characters, and makes me care more, when the action and danger amps up again.\n\nI even teared up a couple of times during my watch, which I’d never expected, coming into this watch.\n\nShow knows how to weave a well-paced, tight story, and make it not only interesting, but stirring as well, and that, altogether, just sucked me in.\n\nJi Jin Hee as Park Moo Jin\n\nTo me, Park Moo Jin’s journey as Acting President forms the cornerstone of this story; I was most invested in his story, and how he would stay true to himself and his values, in the face of a multitude of problems and obstacles, that placed him smack between a rock and hard place.\n\nIf Moo Jin’s experience as Acting President was a rollercoaster, following him on that journey and witnessing his growth and increasing confidence was a similar rollercoaster of a journey, and I loved it.\n\nI truly enjoyed Ji Jin Hee’s delivery of Moo Jin, from his geeky scientist moments, all the way to how he grows into the presidential shoes that have been thrust on him, and every shade of emotion in between.\n\nMy heart couldn’t help but go out to Moo Jin, as he struggled to figure out how to do the right thing, and every time he did well, my heart surged with how gratifying it was.\n\nHere’s a (very) sprawling look at a good number of key Moo Jin moments.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE2. I kind of guessed that Moo Jin would be proven right and that the submarine had sunk and all would be ok, but I was glued to my screen and on the edge of my seat anyway.\n\nThe aggressive military men were annoying, but I could appreciate just how much mental noise Moo Jin was dealing with, within his first few hours as Acting President.\n\nTo have such high stakes is bad enough, but to face those high stakes while everyone is barking at you and at one another, is just so much worse. And to have everyone around you doubting you, even worse.\n\nSo when Moo Jin survives it, and is proven right, victorious in his humaneness, my heart surged for him, and I felt it so much, when he couldn’t even stop his legs from shaking, in the aftermath.\n\nHe’s been through so much, and I’m so happy that his geekiness and smarts stood him in good stead when everyone else was using all their time and energy arguing about how best to bomb North Korea. I’m rooting for Moo Jin so hard and so earnestly now.\n\nAnd I expect that he will continue to win supporters over to his side, just as he’s won me over, over the course of just 2 episodes.\n\nE3. Moo Jin is doing his best not to be a puppet president; working to speak from the heart rather than blindly reading off prepared speeches, spending time studying the Constitution rather than be pulled in a million different directions by people with different agendas.\n\nHe’s not always successful, but he’s valiantly keeping on, even when there are missteps, and I have to admire how focused he is, on revoking the discriminatory act against the North Korean defectors, even to the point of accepting Chief Secretary Han’s (Heo Joon Ho) dare, to fire him, if he wishes to proceed.\n\nI’m not the only one moved by Moo Jin’s actions, as we see from Kim Nam Wook’s (Lee Moo Saeng) briefing to the press. He literally has to blink back tears, as he speaks of Moo Jin’s passing of the executive order.\n\nThis, from the first guy we met from the Blue House, who had spoken so disparagingly about Moo Jin’s future as Acting President. I’d say this is progress.\n\nI have to admire Moo Jin for going all in now, and taking personal and family risk, to pass the executive order, even though his desire is to return to his civilian life after the 60 days are up. He isn’t one to half-ass things, that’s becoming clear.\n\nE4. It’s gratifying to see Moo Jin grow into his authority, and gain confidence when facing all the naysayers in his government, the aggressive loudmouthed military men in particular. I like seeing him have the confidence to put his foot down and be firm, even when his is the unpopular opinion.\n\nThat’s him standing by his decisions, and that takes courage and a measure of faith, especially since he’s the one with the least experience and qualifications in the room.\n\nBut he’s cool-headed, rational and logical, while keeping compassion and empathy for the citizens a priority, and that’s a rare and precious combination indeed.\n\nE4. I like Moo Jin’s enquiring mind, which is totally befitting of the scientist side of him.\n\nWhen everyone around him is freaking out about the video being North Korea’s admission of involvement in the bombing, Moo Jin’s calm, analytical mind is able to pinpoint a key question: if North Korea has always vehemently denied all involvement in all attacks, what makes this different, and why? I like it.\n\nE5. I can understand Moo Jin’s choice during the TV interview. Up to this point, he’s been articulating how honesty is his political policy.\n\nNow, if he chooses to lie in order to protect himself, he instantly proves that honesty isn’t actually his policy; it’s only his policy when he can afford it. So he chooses honesty, even though the fallout is obviously going to be huge.\n\nE5. General Lee (Choi Jae Sung) was really getting out of hand, defying Moo Jin’s orders and even questioning him to his face, about whether he still feels like he has the right to be Commander-in-Chief.\n\nSo when General Lee taunts Moo Jin that he should use his power and authority without hesitation, it’s gratifying to see Moo Jin take control of the situation by revoking General Lee of his military authority, and relieving General Lee of his duties, and informing everyone else present that the same fate awaits anyone who mobilizes the military forces without his express permission.\n\nWell done, sir.\n\nE6. I really appreciate that we see Moo Jin staying up late and worrying about the soldiers he’s sent to Cambodia, that he’s sent them on a dangerous mission, while they have families worrying for them.\n\nHis empathy and compassion and worry are so palpable, and I feel for him, even as I appreciate his humanity. I do love that his wife (Kim Gyu Ri) is so understanding and supportive, and I love how gentle she is, as she assures him that he only made a needed decision.\n\nE6. The operation itself was hard to watch, because it felt so taut and tension-filled. I felt like my nerves were stretched really thin. The hardest thing, though, was seeing Moo Jin’s grief at Major Jang’s (Park Hoon) death.\n\nI can understand his guilt; he’d charged Major Jang to bring back Myung Hae Joon alive, and to bring his men back safely. He hadn’t specifically said to Major Jang to come back safely himself, although that is implied.\n\nIn his shoes, I would feel guilty too, for not having articulated that; for sending him on a dangerous mission; for ultimately being responsible for the operation happening at all, which had then led to Major Jang’s death.\n\nMoo Jin’s grief, as he stands over Major Jang’s casket, is crippling, and I feel so much, in the moment.\n\nI feel sorry for Major Jang, for having lost his life while carrying out his duties, and I feel sorry for Moo Jin, who’s carrying the weight of the guilt of Major Jang’s death on his shoulders.\n\nMoo Jin choking out his tears is truly hard to watch, and I can fully understand why he would go straight to Secretary Han’s residence, and ask him just why he’d put him in this position, to take people’s lives.\n\nIn the face of Moo Jin’s deep grief and distress, I do appreciate Secretary Han’s response. He’s firm and measured, and the words he speaks are wise and balanced, “It’s not your fault. He simply did all he could to fulfill his duties.\n\nHe didn’t run away. He handled it. Just like you, who didn’t return to school that day. And this is the same. President Park. Whether it’s sorrow, guilt, or anger, today is one of those days when you must fulfill your duties without running away or making excuses.\n\nThat is what all the survivors must do.”\n\nI love how his words don’t diminish the tragedy of Major Jang’s death, but at the same time, maintains a full measure of respect for Major Jang as he gave his all to fulfill his duty. His words imply that Major Jang knew full well what he was doing, and made the decision because he felt it was the most needed.\n\nThere’s something very dignified about that.\n\nAnd in the same vein, Secretary Han’s words attribute the same dignity to the decision that Moo Jin has made, to not run away and do his duty. So much wisdom that comforts, respects and affirms, all in one.\n\nE6. I love how Moo Jin is not ashamed to ask Secretary Han to come back. His request is so heartfelt; there’s no guile about it. He doesn’t try to mask his need for Secretary Han, or downplay it in any way.\n\nHe’s open and vulnerable in the moment,\n\n“On that day, I told you that I wasn’t qualified I told you that neither power nor politics suited me. And yet, you brought me this far. So take responsibility. Help me so that I can handle this position. Please. Will you return… to the Blue House?”\n\nIt’s truly one of my favorite things about Moo Jin. He’s sincere and willing to be vulnerable.\n\nE7. Secretary Han’s conversation with Secretary Cha (Son Seok Koo) tells me one thing, that Moo Jin is very astute in reading him. He didn’t approach Secretary Han to return while citing things like the Presidential Election; he’d challenged him to finish what he started.\n\nSecretary Han had no interest in starting again, calling it all a “meaningless fight” – but he came back to fulfill that sense of responsibility that Moo Jin confronted him with.\n\nE7. I didn’t see it coming, that Chief An (Lee Do Yup) was the mole leaking information to Mayor Kang (Ahn Nae Sang). And I’m impressed with Moo Jin for how he handles it.\n\nInstead of firing Chief An right away, he initially tries to convince Chief An with his newly acquired research, without even mentioning the information leak.\n\nIt’s only when that fails, that he reveals the recording. And then instead of firing Chief An, he allows Chief An to make things right with Mayor Kang, before telling him that he can now proceed to demonstrate what he’s really made of. That’s mercy, and that’s grace.\n\nE9. This episode it was mostly about Moo Jin’s scandal, which turns out to be not quite a scandal after all.\n\nThe flashback to how Moo Jin had opened his heart to Kang Yeon and Si Wan (Nam Woo Hyun), even right after he found out she was a divorcee, and then how he subsequently cared for Si Wan like his own son, is very touching.\n\nThat moment in the hospital, when the doc asked him to hold his son, you can just see the realization hit him like a ton of bricks – he could actually be Si Wan’s father. Aw. Moo Jin really is a decent, good man.\n\nI appreciate how fiercely he protects Si Wan, even when his own reputation is at stake. And I’m glad that Si Wan appreciates it too, and comes around quite noticeably, from his anti-Dad rebellion.\n\nE10. Moo Jin’s heart and humanity is never far from the surface. At the report of the death of Joon Oh (Lee Ha Yool), one of his first thoughts is what a sacrifice Joon Oh has made for the country, and how sorry he is, that he can’t even send condolences to the family, because Joon Oh is already legally dead.\n\nHis request, that Joon Oh’s funeral be as formal as possible, is the only thing he can think of to do, and it’s clear from his expression that he feels this is far from adequate.\n\nE11. It’s hard to watch Moo Jin struggling from pain while lying in hospital. His labored breathing while he ekes out the words that he wants to speak makes my heart pinch for him. He’s really dedicated to his country, even though he’s wounded and in pain, and there’s a measure of threat, to his life.\n\nAlso, it’s moving to see how the people around him have come to care for him. His protocol administrator (Park Geun Rok) having to stop to cry for a bit, out of worry for Moo Jin, says a lot about how much he’s affected the people around him.\n\nEven Assemblywoman Yoon (Bae Jong Ok) pauses to let him know that despite his unmarketability as politician, she trusts him, and wishes him a successful surgery. I found that quite touching.\n\nAnd then there’s Kim Nam Wook’s heartfelt statement before the press, that he wishes Moo Jin well. I do love that everyone’s coming around to appreciate Moo Jin’s goodness and decency.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nThe relationship between Moo Jin and Kang Yeon\n\nEven though Moo Jin’s relationship with his wife Kang Yeon is mostly kept on the sidelines, I genuinely loved their marriage relationship for its healthy and supportive dynamics.\n\nIt’s true that Moo Jin’s new schedule means that he spends a lot less time with his family, but when he does have time to spend with Kang Yeon, they always spend the time in meaningful conversation.\n\nIt’s clear to see that even though we see very little of Kang Yeon in the overall scheme of things, that she truly is a pillar of support – and a source of timely wisdom – to Moo Jin, and that he could’ve never made it through his term without her.\n\nSo much love for this couple, even though we don’t see them much together at all.\n\nHere are just a few highlights, of this sweet couple.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE5. I also appreciate the small detail, where we see Moo Jin’s wife silently show him support as they appear in public for the memorial service. The handhold and the steady, solemn exchange of gazes; he knows that she’s right there on his side, and I like that a lot.\n\nE7. I really love how strong the marital relationship is, between Moo Jin and Kang Yeon. He’s terse and snappish with her when he comes home, with the non-party cabinet dilemma on his mind, but she doesn’t react with hostility in return.\n\nShe asks what’s happened instead; she knows her husband well enough to know that he wouldn’t normally behave like this.\n\nAnd it isn’t long before they’re sitting hand in hand, he having confided in her, and she promising to help him decide, if he’ll tell her what he really wants. And then she stays up all night researching the Constitution for him, so that he’ll have fresh ammunition the next day.\n\nSeriously, this is relationship goals.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nNa Kyung is given room to be strong\n\nIn a male-dominated cast set in a male-dominated world, I thought it was important to mention that Show is gives Agent Han Na Kyung (Kang Han Na) a lot of space to be a strong, badass woman, even while acknowledging her difficult emotional circumstances.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nI can’t imagine being in Na Kyung’s position, to be on the brink of marrying your fiance, only to lose him to a bomb attack, and then, without any time to really figure out anything or grieve, just plow straight into investigation mode, because that’s her job.\n\nThe emotional toll on her must be huge, so it’s a cathartic moment, in episode 5, to see her cry over the wedding album that’s been delivered to her home, all these days that she’s been holed up at work trying to solve the question of who bombed the National Assembly Building.\n\nEven when she’s lost her fiance to the terror attack, she’s not written to crumple and collapse; no, she gathers herself up and investigates with a vengeance.\n\nAnd she runs down suspects, and kicks them around, even as she gets kicked around; she’s allowed to go into dangerous situations alone, and she’s appointed to lead the investigation by the Acting President.\n\nNo one said, hey, this is too dangerous for a woman, let a man lead the way.\n\nNo, she continues to lead the investigation, and when she wakes up bound and gagged in a car with a ticking bomb in it, she frees herself, and then, to save innocent passers-by from danger, drives the car to explode in the river. Bad. Ass.\n\nEven when there are other agents supporting the operation, and she doesn’t have to operate on her own, she’s still out in front, leading the way. I like it.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nSon Seok Koo as Secretary Cha\n\nSon Seok Koo is pretty darn great as Secretary Cha, and I found Secretary Cha’s personal journey very gratifying to watch.\n\nFrom someone whose prime concern is how to best navigate the political game for the best approval ratings and the most advantageous outcomes, Secretary Cha’s heart comes to the forefront in a way that I’m sure even he didn’t expect.\n\nThe fact that Secretary Cha’s transformation had everything to do with his being continually in Moo Jin’s orbit, just made it even more satisfying.\n\nHere are my favorite Secretary Cha moments, during my watch.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE5. Secretary Cha really is good at what he does. Even though he doesn’t seek permission first, his strategy works flawlessly.\n\nNot only does it suddenly diminish Moo Jin’s dismissal in the public’s eyes, it harnesses the public’s fear to Moo Jin’s advantage, just like Assemblywoman Yoon had mentioned in episode 4.\n\nIt’s clear on hindsight that this was the fastest and most efficient way to solve the fallout from the interview, and Moo Jin sees it too. I approve Moo Jin’s decision to appoint Secretary Cha as Chief Secretary.\n\nE8. Secretary Cha’s outburst in front of Secretary Jung feels so raw, so deep and so personal. I’m a little taken aback at how strongly he feels about President Yang (Kim Gab Soo), and how regretful he is at how he’d missed the chance to help him leave a more dignified legacy.\n\nE9. As much as this is a journey for Moo Jin, it’s also a journey for Secretary Cha. As Secretary Han rightly points out, Secretary Cha needs to come around to the person, instead of fixating on the approval ratings.\n\nE11. Secretary Cha’s emotional outburst in response to Secretary Jung questioning his loyalties, also says a lot about how Moo Jin has affected him. This isn’t just business, anymore. He sincerely wants Moo Jin back.\n\nE12. It’s telling, that after being cleared of any suspicion during the investigation, Secretary Cha’s main concern is whether Moo Jin believed the allegations to be true. Na Kyung’s indirect answer, stating that if Moo Jin had believed it to be true, that Secretary Cha would have been relieved of his duties first, hits Secretary Cha in the heart.\n\nHe stops for a brief moment to process the thought, and only the slight tug at his lips hint at his comfort and pleasure, at the answer.\n\nE12. Secretary Cha turning in his resignation because he didn’t want to be a burden to Moo Jin, with all the media speculation about him being investigated in relation to the bombing, says a lot about how much his loyalties have rooted themselves with Moo Jin.\n\nAnd that moment during the press conference, when Moo Jin finally announces his decision to run for president, the look on Secretary Cha’s face is just so intense.\n\nHe’s choked up with emotion, there’s relief in his eyes, a tug at his lips as he can’t decide whether to smile or cry; it’s a dramatic, tense, acutely personal moment for him, and I love it.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nThe lashings of a loveline between Secretary Cha and Secretary Jung\n\nThe “some” flirtation and sparks between Secretary Cha and Secretary Jung (Choi Yoon Young) are super cute, and a very welcome respite from the dramatic tension, with their goofy-awkward bickering turning into date invitations and dorky grins.\n\nI can see why everyone who was watching this show shipped these two, so hard. They are adorable.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nI liked the moment when (now-Chief) Secretary Cha asks Secretary Jung whether she’d like to get some chimaek with him. It’s so typical of their awkward-funny banter.\n\nHe looks so self-conscious as he tries to (quite lamely) explain that since they hadn’t had dinner, that that’s why he thought he’d ask.\n\nTo me, it feels like his attempt at a gracious and appreciative response, after Secretary Jung stalks back into his new office to finish what she’d been trying to say earlier, that yes, she would have resisted the idea of leaking the video, but that she would have come around if he’d told her his reasons, because he’s that good at what he does.\n\nI love this rather awkward moment of mutual acknowledgement, and I love even more, how Secretary Jung turns him down, saying that she’s not mature enough to buy him a celebratory drink, nor does she like the idea of him buying her a consolation drink, heh.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nThe ensemble of the Blue House staff\n\nShout-out to the staff at the Blue House; I found myself growing fond of them over the course of my watch.\n\nIn particular, I enjoyed Protocol Administrator Park for his dorky, earnest ways, Acting Press Secretary Kim Nam Wook for his often bemused reactions, which alternated with his heartfelt wonderment at some of Moo Jin’s decisions, and Presidential Secretary Min (Baek Hyun Joo) for her dry and shrewd commentary and insights.\n\nI felt rather sorry to say goodbye to this bunch, by the time I got to the finale.\n\nSTUFF THAT WAS NEUTRAL\n\nThe writing\n\nGenerally speaking, I thought the writing in this show was solid, but I also came to the conclusion that the writing is stronger in the beginning of our story, than in the later stretch.\n\nIn Show’s earlier stretch, the writing felt confident and tight, and I felt like Show knew exactly where it wanted to go, and I felt like I could trust it to take me there.\n\nShow effectively kept me on the edge of my seat, and made my watch experience feel both thrilling, yet emotionally satisfying. All very good things.\n\nHowever, in Show’s later episodes, I started to notice a couple of weak spots in the writing, and also, I started to notice a distinct pattern in the way Moo Jin’s strength of character is showcased.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nWeak spot\n\nIn terms of writing weak spots, I have a couple more which I’ll mention in other sections, but the incident in episode 8, where Han Mo (Kim Joo Hun) confesses to the murder he didn’t commit, made me wonder why no one in our drama world thinks to ask if he’s being threatened.\n\nI mean, that was my first thought, (likely a result of my sageuk exposure, since that’s totally a sageuk type of event), but all the trained, experienced agents, investigators and other respected figures in the Blue House, didn’t think to ask it. I thought that was odd and unrealistic.\n\nThe pattern\n\nI suppose it’s to Show’s credit that it’s only pretty late in the game, that the plotting and storytelling pattern becomes more concrete and apparent.\n\nConsistently, we see Moo Jin come up against an obstacle, and Show cuts away to the unfolding of the related events, allowing tension to build, and then, at the last moment, it’s revealed that a critical soundbite and portion of conversation took place which we didn’t have access to before, where Moo Jin’s warmth and humanity gets through to the other party, which then results in a win for Moo Jin, at the end.\n\nWe see it twice in episode 15, once with General Lee, and then again, with Assemblywoman Yoon.\n\nI don’t dislike it, but we’ve seen key events pan out in similar ways a number of times now, and it’s starting to feel, well, predictable.\n\nStill, until Show does the reveal, the suspense is effective. The question of whether or not things will go as expected, hangs in the air until Show unveils the hidden scene.\n\nSo it’s effective. Just, kind of predictable in hindsight, which is unfortunate.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nLee Joon Hyuk as Oh Young Seok\n\nI put the character of Oh Young Seok in this section because while Oh Young Seok is an effective character that brings needed dramatic tension to our story, and Lee Joon Hyuk’s delivery of his character is solid, I didn’t exactly enjoy Oh Young Seok as a character.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nI found Oh Young Seok an intriguing character. On the one hand, he seems shady and nefarious, being involved in a scheme where he aims to take the position of President of Korea, at any cost.\n\nAnd when he does get to be Acting President at the episode 11 mark, it’s hard to watch as he asserts himself and makes decisions that mask questionable motives.\n\nLee Joon Hyuk does a great job of imbuing Oh Young Seok with just enough tamped down smirk to make me dislike him, while wearing the most reasonable and righteous expression, to defend his stand.\n\nI mean, not just keeping the stock market open, but to shoot to kill the sniper? That’s obviously to stop the investigation in its tracks to protect himself, rather than to protect the investigators.\n\nYet, there are moments when it seems that Oh Young Seok might have positive intentions, underneath it all. In episode 6, his hint to Moo Jin about how to resolve the stalemate with the Cambodian government is intriguing.\n\nWhen Moo Jin asks why he’s helping, Oh Young Seok replies that he has pledged to serve the nation.\n\nHow interesting, and contrary, and intriguing.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nSTUFF I LIKED LESS\n\nSometimes – just sometimes – I felt a touch of caricature\n\nWhile I generally found Show’s characterization well done, I have to admit that I felt a touch of caricature, in spots.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\n1. Don’t military men obey authority unequivocally? General Lee and General Eun (Lee Ki Young) getting all shouty in front of the Acting President seems like a rather dodgy thing?\n\nAlso, General Lee deciding to prepare troops to depart for Cambodia, against Moo Jin’s orders, is also going against his military code of conduct. I found this extreme, unreasonable behavior rather caricature-y.\n\n2. I don’t know if Show gives us an accurate portrayal of press conferences, but I felt consistently frustrated and annoyed at how the reporters behave in each of the press conferences.\n\nThey shout out question after question, and seem intent on drowning out the person they’re firing questions at. They come across as so aggressive and ill-mannered, seriously. That felt rather caricature-y, too, to my eyes.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nTHEMES / IDEAS\n\nE3. The idea of a double-edged sword, dressed as something helpful. I don’t know how accurate the depiction of policy is, in our show, but the consideration of hidden agenda underneath a seemingly helpful piece of advice, is a lesson that I feel I need to chew on.\n\nAssemblywoman Yoon’s tip to Moo Jin on how to handle Mayor Kang seemed innocent and well-meaning, but underneath it lay a double-pronged intention to destroy; one, to destroy Mayor Kang’s reputation, and two, to put the idea of Moo Jin’s impeachment in the spotlight.\n\nHow disturbingly dark, yet.. quite masterful.\n\nE13. The idea of how truth can be twisted. The way that Moo Jin’s stand can be twisted either way to create a salacious headline, really makes me think about media manipulation and spin doctoring.\n\nThe reporters are making Moo Jin’s stand regarding same-sex relationships a damned if he does, and damned if he doesn’t thing. He just can’t win, the way they’re going about it.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON EPISODE 14 [SPOILERS]\n\nWe get another weak spot in the writing. Why would they wait this long to do a handwriting analysis on the dying message? Wouldn’t that be one of the first things to do, when they first tried to decipher the message?\n\nThat feels like a red herring, deliberately put in there to keep our investigators on the wrong path until the right time.\n\nBut, I’m impressed with the fact that the writing is closing in on wrapping up our story, in a way that feels planned for and tight. With just 3 episodes to go, and about half the time left of Moo Jin’s current term, it felt like a big ask, for Show to even begin to wrap things up in a way that felt cohesive and satisfying.\n\nBut that’s exactly what I feel like Show is doing.\n\nA lot happens this episode, and things are falling into place where it does look like we’re about to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it doesn’t feel rushed, stuff doesn’t feel shoehorned in, and yes, it does feel cohesive.\n\nPlus, this episode literally is Show’s most fast-paced and exciting. I’m impressed.\n\nThere were some good twists and reveals this episode, which I liked.\n\nThe fact that General Eun knew that he was being bugged, and basically led Na Kyung’s investigation to the tailor shop, so that she would be able to corner Oh Young Seok, so that Oh Young Seok would have a reason to accept General Eun’s offer. That was pretty twisty, which I liked.\n\nAnd then there’s Han Moo, doing his own investigation and unearthing important information, which is important to Na Kyung’s investigation. In that sense, that was a bit of a twist that added ammunition to our good guys, even when the investigation that we’ve been privy to, has run into issues.\n\nWe are reminded that Moo Jin is sympathetic because we can see that he doesn’t have all the answers, and he’s not perfect, either.\n\nEven when he means well, like when he decides to defer the passing of the Discrimination Act until the next administration, he ends up disappointing Director Noh (Seo Young Hwa) and others like her.\n\nWhich makes him realize that he’s essentially doing the same thing that his predecessor President Yang had done.\n\nAnd then we have the final twist, of Oh Young Seok being gunned down, not by investigators, but by his own assistant, who makes the decision that Oh Young Seok needs to die a hero, and so shoots him in an honor killing, before killing himself. Dang.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON THE PENULTIMATE EPISODE [SPOILERS]\n\nI found our penultimate episode pretty solid, even though there are questions thrown up that we ultimately don’t get answers to.\n\nMoo Jin’s ability to read General Lee and understand his priorities – that the honor of the military as a whole is more important than his personal honor – demonstrates that he’s very sharp, and very shrewd, even amidst his warmth and desire to believe in people. He has the ability to understand people and what motivates them.\n\nOn top of that, he has the ability to share his observations in a way that communicates respect and honor. At Moo Jin’s description of him, General Lee seemed visibly moved, that someone had seen him, and so clearly too.\n\nThe scene of Moo Jin and General Lee after the arrests have been made, where General Lee reports to Moo Jin as Commander-in-Chief, and they salute each other, then shake hands, all with tears burgeoning in their eyes, is most moving.\n\nSo much mutual regard and respect, communicated in that moment. I love it.\n\nI’m not surprised that Tailor Kim (Jeon Park Chan) is the hidden VIP, but I’m curious as to who he was speaking to, when it sounded like he was carrying out someone else’s orders, and I also want to know what his true connection to Assemblywoman Yoon is.\n\nAlso, Assemblywoman Yoon did not mention anything about having met him before, when Moo Jin shared the photos of Tailor Kim as a key suspect. That’s suspicious, to me.\n\nEven if I want to rationalize that she’d met him as one of many constituents, and because she meets so many new people all the time, that she didn’t remember him, it still doesn’t explain how she knew his name right away at the sight of the photos, and made that call to him right away, like she was already familiar with him.\n\nAnd there was the thing where she asked, “Is this your way of saying you’ll expose me?” Importantly, Show never addresses this, which I’m disappointed by.\n\nOne of the most moving moments this episode, is when Secretary Han talks with Moo Jin about the issue of whether or not he will join Moo Jin’s presidential campaign. Secretary Han has so many reservations about putting his faith on the line again, to believe again, in the hope of a better country and government, when he’d allowed that hope to die with President Yang.\n\nAnd yet, it’s Moo Jin’s keen observation and warm articulation of the fact that Secretary Han hasn’t turned into a monster like he warns Moo Jin about, that seems to hit him right in the heart. It seems like in this moment, Secretary Han finally feels the spark of hope and courage that he needs, to believe again.\n\nAnd when Secretary Han makes it clear that he will help Moo Jin, when Moo Jin smiles at him with gladness and gratitude, there’s a sense of peace and liberation in Secretary Han’s face, which is heartening to see.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE ENDING [SPOILERS]\n\nI’m reluctant to admit it, but I have to say that I feel somewhat underwhelmed by Show’s finale.\n\nAfter so many episodes of dramatic tension pivoting on the hope of seeing Moo Jin prove all the naysayers wrong and then growing into the role of the President of Korea, I felt rather disappointed that in the end, Moo Jin bows out of the presidential race.\n\nGranted, his reasons for doing so were valid, and given the circumstances, I concede that Moo Jin stayed true to his character, in choosing to do the right thing, instead of the thing that would bring him the most advantage.\n\nHowever, I do have trouble accepting the reveal, that Secretary Han was the Big Bad.\n\nI mean, Show expects me to buy his explanation, that he plotted to kill President Yang, whom he deeply believed in, and wipe out the entire administration, because he was convinced that the people of Korea didn’t deserve a good president like President Yang?\n\nThat’s.. messed up, and more than that, reallly far-fetched. One would have to be a sociopath &amp;/or a psychopath to genuinely believe that train of thought and maintain that they did the right thing.\n\nAdditionally, if Secretary Han genuinely believed that the plan that he’d had, had been the better way, I feel like it doesn’t mesh so well, with his decision to join Moo Jin’s campaign.\n\nAnd, Secretary Han did appear to feel sincerely positive and excited at the prospect of supporting Moo Jin on his campaign, right until Moo Jin asked to speak with him privately.\n\nIn principle, I’m not against the idea of writing Secretary Han as the mastermind of the bombing, but these little details in the execution niggle at me.\n\nAnd, while I’m not about to rewatch this show to check Secretary Han’s behavior through the various stages of our story, I feel like Secretary Han is shown in a reasonable and humane light, even though his opinions sometimes differed from Moo Jin’s.\n\nI don’t know. I just find it hard to believe that he would have ordered Moo Jin’s (ultimately failed) assassination, y’know?\n\nAnd then there’s the thing where we see Tae Ik (otherwise known as Lee Gyeong Pyo) leaving the country, while reporting to someone in Japanese.\n\nCould he be talking to the VIP? If so.. does this mean that possibly, Secretary Han is but a mole taking the fall for the real VIP, who is the mysterious person on the phone? We can only guess.\n\nAnyway. That’s how we find out that Moo Jin had been selected to be the Acting President, the titular designated survivor, chosen for his lack of political experience and ambition, so that it would be easy to replace him, come the presidential elections.\n\nShow doesn’t reveal who wins the election in the end, but we do see Moo Jin’s heartfelt farewell with the staff of the Blue House. The wistfulness is mutual, and there are visible tears in the eyes of more than a few individuals, as Moo Jin thanks each person one by one.\n\nSniffle. I wish he didn’t have to say goodbye, coz it’s clear that they’ve all come to appreciate and respect him.\n\nTime skip later, we see that Moo Jin’s gone back to teaching, and is now able to spend quality time with his family. We also see that he has something on his mind, as even an offer from Stanford makes him hesitate.\n\nAt the same time, we also see that the key members of Moo Jin’s staff at the Blue House, are all unhappy in their current positions (I don’t quite get this, did they all resign from the Blue House after Moo Jin’s departure, coz I’d expected that they’d have continued in their roles otherwise?).\n\nSecretary Cha gathers Secretary Jung, Press Secretary Kim Nam Wook and Protocol Administrator Park, and together, they seek out Moo Jin, and ask if he’d consider joining the next presidential race; that they will help him, together.\n\nMoo Jin smiles in response – which is when Show’s final credits roll.\n\nGuh. I have to admit, I’m rather disappointed that we don’t even get to see if Moo Jin agrees or not, to the proposal of this adorkable ragtag group that just wants to support him.\n\nI mean, I geddit, the ending is designed with a possible sequel in mind. But if that’s the case, then at least give us a little something to go on? I’m a little peeved by this, no lie.\n\nStill, I have to admit that despite my personal sense of dissatisfaction with how the finale was handled, that I truly enjoyed sharing in Moo Jin’s journey as Acting President.\n\nAnd honestly, if Show manages a comeback via a sequel, I’m so there, to share in Moo Jin’s journey towards President, too.\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT:\n\nShow leans idealistic and is unrealistic in spots, but is uplifting and stirring, nonetheless.\n\nFINAL GRADE: B+\n\nTEASER:\n\nMV:\n\n### Share this:\n\n- Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\n- Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\n\n### Related\n\n# Post navigation\n\nNotify of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nΔ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nΔ\n\nComments\n\nInline Feedbacks\n\nView all comments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsimyun\n\n1 year ago\n\nSuch a well written review and observation!\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 year ago\n\nReply to\n\nThank you, I’m glad you enjoyed the review, simyun!

I didn’t expect him to be the same type of fine and decent character in Survivor, but his genuine and upstanding Acting President is a main reason I gobbled up Show from beginning to end, despite some shortcomings. Next time I’m given the chance to meet Ji Jin Hee in person, I’ll probably decline so that I don’t risk mucking up my images of these two uber mensch characters. 😆\n\n&lt;SPOILERS&gt;\n\nI agree with Fangurl’s review whole-heartedly – with just a couple of differences. First, I saw Secretary Han from a mile away as the Blue House collaborator, not because any post-justification of his motives made sense (they decidedly did not), but because he was the person most likely to have access to all of the key information and opportunity required for the role.\n\nSecond – and the real reason I dropped by to leave this post 😉 – I was surprised that KFG’s review did not rail more at the myriad unrealistic instances of profound incompetency exhibited by security, protection, and police personnel. Was no security expert ever trained that, when on the run, not to stand in the middle of the road, exposed to every gun in the area, to have your tender moment? Do federal prisons not fully vet the personnel who deliver food to the most notorious national security villain in the country, let alone allow some unknown, unproven guard to be the one to escort said key-witness villain to the emergency room? Are crack NIS agents not rigorously drilled on when to take the shot? Or wait for/bring along back-up? Do NIS agents known to, and pursued by, adversaries, regularly dine al fresco and make themselves easy targets? These are but a few of the 🤦‍♀️moments that almost ruined Show for me. They felt like lazy devices to move the show along, rather than writers making the effort to create more credible and realistic transitions. Luckily, Show’s other charms more than made up for this asininity, so it was an overall super watch. Rant over. 😅\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Reviewer\n\n4 years ago\n\nAnother excellent review, thank you.\n\nI watched this last week, after having watched the US version that is quite similar a few years back.\n\nThe show just one season, short and sweet, unlike the US version that lasted several seasons and stretched the story out to a point where the show got cancelled.\n\nI really enjoyed this show, but for some shortcomings in writing. Is something like this plausible in real life? May be. Once you answer yes to that, rest of the show is enjoyable for the most part.\n\nKang Han Na stole the show in my opinion, overcoming some of the bad writing around her character. Some of the agent’s action left me wondering/saying – hey, a trained agent would never do that. For example why travel in front of the van that carries the prisoner??? Why does one have to review the documents standing in front of the safe??\n\nPortrayal of the President was above average. In the earlier episodes, I felt like something was missing, was not able to put my finger on it.\n\nRest of the supporting cast did a good job of portraying their respective roles.\n\nI wish there were more sparks between the two secretaries, the US version had a lot more of it, and was fun to watch. But then again, romance wasn’t any significant part of the plot.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the behavior of the military officers and secretaries towards the acting president. I am not a Korean national, so I don’t know what the protocol is. I felt a lot of discomfort watching the interactions, US president once sworn in is treated with so much respect by people around him (don’t get me wrong, the public does not, as you know); there are protocols in place. Doesn’t something similar apply?\n\nBut for the few short comings in writing, I really enjoyed this show.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4 years ago\n\nLove this show a lot.. 😀\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nYes, this was such a good one! 😀\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nThank you so much, kfangurl, for this review! I would have completely missed this show without your post – I didn’t even know it existed. This turned out to be one of my favorite 2019 dramas! I completely agree with you about the finale. When I started to feel hints that Secretary Han could be the one, I was REALLY hoping it wasn’t the case, but I realize now that the main reason I had that hope was indeed because it was way too far-fetched. It didn’t make any sense from what we’ve seen from Secretary Han, and in the end the justification was just weird. So yes, that’s disappointing, just like how the relationship between Assemblywoman Yoon and Tailor Kim is not clarified, and how we never get to know who’s the “real” VIP. However, in this case, the 15 episodes I’ve watched while being completely hooked and on the edge of my seat have more weight than the disappointment I felt in the last episode. Also, the cute team coming back at the end kind of won me over… So overall, I think this show is REALLY worth the watch even with its few flaws. I had a great time watching it – thank you again! 🙂\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nAh!

The stakes are more emotional, but I found it a good exploration of human weakness. 🙂\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nA delightful breakdown kfangurl of a show that I really wanted to like. I’m glad it took your through the looking glass into the political arena. As for myself, I enjoyed the start. As Timescout mentions, the K version does follow the original version faithfully. However, as with the original, I dropped it half way through because I was hoping for it to be better than it’s predecessor (given the cast), and for me, that didn’t happen.\n\nThe acting was on point, as you would expect from such a cast. Who can fault the President – not me. He is principled and knows the truth is better than a lie. More about this later. I liked the portrayal of the partnership between the President and his wife as it resonated very strongly. And, yes I enjoyed the moments between the two secretaries/advisors. My personal favourite is our special agent, but like the original, I became frustrated with how such a good, strong character was all at sea in such a setting. As for the main baddy, no surprise there, and because of my suspicions, a large part of my disappointment, because I suspected this from the get go.\n\nSo, the writing became the let down for me. I truly love a good political drama, even one that is mythical in its breadth and scope, or where you have to suspend belief and enjoy the action. Sadly, DS just wasn’t “it” for me. Like it’s original template, Show tried to be too clever, and then, for me, over dramatic at times, hence the use of the caricatures. I just couldn’t adjust my lens!\n\nForgive me now for stepping up to the political pulpit. Here is the interesting thing: complex strategies do not work in the real world of politics. The truth is simple. A lie is not (unless it is kept simple – but this doesn’t happen in the dramaverse). To this extent, Chief of Staff, which is a fine show in itself, is far superior in terms of how a political office works, the political process and the strategies used. Then, if we want a real lesson in how politics works: we turn to the West Wing. Such a well written, and dare I say, insightful show. Even my wife has watched it a number of times. There is even an Australian political comedy that is so accurate about what happens, I have flashbacks 😂. With both shows my wife looks at me with amusement when I say: been there, done that. So, one time my wife and I were invited to a lunch at a big annual event, as I was one of the key stakeholders at the time. It was an informal affair. As we entered the room, the Minister says “L come and sit next to me. You are much more interesting to talk to than Sean (which is true)!” I just rolled my eyes and said T, I have a long memory 😜\n\nWishing you a Happy New Year kfangurl and I look forward to your annual overview 🎉🍾🥂\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nHi there Sean! It’s taken me quite a while to work my way through the comments, thank you for your good nature and patience, I always appreciate it! 🙂 It’s very possible that I enjoyed this show more than you did because I’m new to the genre. I guess the tropes and narrative milestones common to the political genre is still new to me, and therefore, it didn’t feel cliched to me. Maybe with a few more political dramas under my belt, I will start to feel differently! 😅 I personally didn’t expect the Big Bad the way you did, and even though it was a surprise when Show unveiled it, I have to confess that overall, it doesn’t strike me as terribly cohesive. When I stack up earlier scenes with the Big Bad, with the later scenes are the reveal, it doesn’t seem to sit so organically, overall. :/ But, I enjoyed everything else well enough, that I still rate the show an enjoyable experience overall. 🙂\n\nThanks to your endorsement, I’ve put Chief of Staff on my list, where it never had a place before, so thanks for that, Sean! 😀 I hope I will enjoy it as much as you did, when I get to it! 🙂\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nOne of the really good things about Chief of Staff is the performances and Shin Min Ah’s in particular.

This is still on hold but I do aim to get back to it in the near future. Chief of Staff is also on the list, so I have to see which one to tackle first. Watching two political dramas at the same time is a bit too much to handle. ;D Besides I’ve stil got Joy of Life on the go and that one is kinda full of political shenanigans too, only in a very appealing “wrapping”. I’m loving it! 😀\n\nI’ve watched the first two seasons of the original US show, which wasn’t too bad. I liked S1 more than the following one. From what I’ve read about the Korean version and what I remember from the early episodes is that it seems to follow the US verson pretty faithfully. I peeked at some points on your review and one thing that has changed is the motive for the attack. It wasn’t anything mindblowing in the original either but made sense within the context. I don’t think it would have worked in this version though, as it was sort of culture specific.\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nHi there Timescout! Yes, I do agree that with politically themed shows, the right frame of mind is very key. Without it, I might not find enough interest to pursue the story. As a noob to political stories, this is especially true for me I think! 😅 So I perfectly understand that this and Chief of Staff are on hold for you right now. I’m interested to check out Chief of Staff, but that’s currently on hold for me too. I haven’t seen the US original, but I do remember thinking, as I watched, that the writers had done a good job adapting the story for a Korean context.\n\nI’ve also got my eye on Joy of Life, so yay that you’ve been loving it – that’s always a rare and precious thing, particularly when you’ve found that many of the popular shows just don’t capture your fancy. Based on how it’s making you happy, I feel like I ought to bump that show up my list! 😉\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nJoy of Life is just about the only drama I’ve been actively watching from week to week. It’s been my catnip. 😁 I’m rather sad it’s ended and we have to wait god knows how long for the 2nd instalment. Not too hot on the cliffhanger at the end of S1 but as I know how the story continues, I’m not that bothered about it. It’s an intriguing story with a very good cast and I just loved the more humorous take on it.\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nOh! Season 1 ends on a cliffhanger? Dang. Would you recommend watching S1 as it is, or would waiting for S2 to be available be a smarter choice? 😅\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nI’d watch it regardless of the ending, in fact you could just stop at 2nd to last epi (ep 45) as that would actually be a good spot. 🙂\n\nI didn’t remember that cliffhanger from the novel, so I checked – yup, it’s not there. Neither is what leads up the that point. Also the reveal towards the end of the last epi happens around 30 chapters later in the novel, but not the way it’s done in Drama. So far this is the second bigger change the scriptwriter has made, but I’m sure the story will eventually align with the novel. Still, I wish they’d skipped the ‘dramatics’, Drama didn’t need it.\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nLol. Yes, sometimes shows really would do well to end earlier, rather than squeeze out additional episodes, I think! Thanks for the tip, I’ll keep it in mind! 😀\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSnow Flower\n\n5 years ago\n\nThis was one of my favorite shows this year, despite its flaws. I usually like political intrigue, but only in sageuks. This was my first contemporary political drama and I loved it! Secretary Cha was a standout character for me. I was so relieved when he did not turn out to be the traitor! I have never seen the actor before, but his performance was a revelation. I need to take a look at his previous work.\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nGlad that you enjoyed this one too, Snow Flower! 😀 And yes, Son Seok Koo does have the kind of screen presence that pulls you in, doesn’t he? He had a minor role in Be Melodramatic, and I liked him so much in that, that I decided to check out this show. That’s how much he influenced my viewing decision! 😆 So I totally feel you, on wanting to check out his other works. 😉\n\n0\n\n# 16 March 2024\n\nThanks to those of you who’ve been waiting for this; my review of c-drama Blossom is finally ready! 😎 Come relive the feels with me? ❤️\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nToday I’m sharing an excerpt from my episode 1-4 notes for When Life Gives You Tangerines, which I am loving much more than I’d originally expected. 😍 I hope you guys enjoy.\n\n– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nMy friends.

This season, <Name>Designated Survivor: 60 Days</Name> is that show, for me.</p>\n            <p>Personally, I don’t have a strong interest in politics, and therefore, I’ve always thought that political shows wouldn’t be my thing, which is why I didn’t think to check out this show, when it first aired earlier this year.</p>\n            <p>But, because I recently really enjoyed <Actor>Son Seok Koo</Actor> in <Title>Be Melodramatic</Title>, and also because I do have a soft spot for <Actor>Ji Jin Hee</Actor>, I decided to try this one, just to see, and – I’m kinda shocked, actually, by how much I liked it.

Woah, right?</p>\n            <p>The main threads include an ongoing investigation that tries to uncover the truth behind the bombing, which Show mostly manages with a tight hand.</p>\n            <p>Our agents learn new information steadily, but it’s always in fragments, and the mystery behind what it all means, is one hook of this tale.</p>\n            <p>At the same time, there’s the whole question of how our shocked, blindsided new Acting President is going to survive this, and make his own mark on the world.</p>\n            <p>It’s immediately apparent that <Character>Park Moo Jin</Character> (<Actor>Ji Jin Hee</Actor>) is not politically savvy; he’s genuinely interested in making the world a better place for the people who live in it; he sincerely wants to do the honest and right thing.</p>\n            <p>We also see that oftentimes, the people around him do not agree with his way of doing things.</p>\n        </content>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <title>The accessibility</title>\n        <content>\n            <p>I do have to credit Show with making all the politics and accompanying politicking accessible to even a political noob like me.</p>\n            <p>In some ways, this story gave me a few sageuk vibes.</p>\n            <p>The different parties fighting for political power; the idea of soldiers dying in vain for a country that doesn’t know or care, and the possible revenge thread that comes out of that; ruthless measures being taken to silence people; people getting killed before they are able to give any information; people getting threatened into making false confessions of murder.</p>\n            <p>It all smells somewhat like a sageuk.</p>\n        </content>\n    </section>\n    \n    <section>\n        <title>It’s compelling</title>\n        <content>\n            <p>I have to give it to Show, generally speaking, this story feels strong and well-paced. Our narrative gets time to ebb and flow, and we do get time to breathe in between more exciting portions of the plot, and Show knows how to keep my attention, through it all.</p>\n            <p>It all comes together to be compelling and engaging, and even rather educational, all at once.</p>\n            <p>As a bonus, I thought the music for this show was well-selected and applied.

This show made my heart so, so full, and I happily drowned in all of the feels.\n\nOur cast is very strong, but I do sincerely think that this would’ve been a different show without Lee Do Hyun. He delivers such a heartfelt performance, with such a distinct sense of gravitas, that I am completely blown away.\n\nThe heart-eyes that I’ve grown for Lee Do Hyun are completely involuntary, and likely permanent. 😍\n\nUnreservedly recommend.\n\nTHE LONG VERDICT:\n\nThey say that what you do is less important than how you do it, and that is so true, of this show.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there really isn’t anything particularly groundbreaking about our story (it’s an adaptation, after all), and yet, it honestly doesn’t matter, because everything is so heartfelt that Show has me by the heart anyway. I guess what’s surprising, is just how much I like this show.\n\nThe other thing that’s surprising, is how quickly I started to like this one. As early as episode 1, I already felt engaged and invested. That’s no small deal, since most dramas need a few episodes to get settled, and into a groove.\n\nI think one of show’s strengths, is how relatable it is. I’m guessing that many of us have regrets in life, and wonder what we would do differently, if we had the chance (I know I do). And here, Dae Young has that chance.\n\nWe don’t understand the magic of it, exactly, but it’s so easy to be invested in Dae Young’s second go-around in high school, because in a tangential sort of way, it feels like a vicarious second chance for us too.\n\nTo my eyes, Show’s true magic is how it has a way of making me laugh, and making me cry, and making my heart swell to the point of bursting, in the best way possible. And, it has a rather extraordinary way of making heartache feel sweet, in the midst of the poignance, too. So. Good.\n\nThank you, Show, for existing. ❤️\n\nOST ALBUM: FOR YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE\n\nHere’s the OST album in case you’d like to listen to it while you read the review.\n\nI personally really enjoyed the OST and felt it was excellently applied to lift the watch experience. The song that really got under my skin, though, is Track 2, Hello.\n\nSomehow, that grabbed my heart in a big way. To my ears, it felt like the cry of Dae Young’s heart, as he stands before his beloved Da Jung, but can’t tell her who he is.\n\nI imagine him wanting so much, to say to her, as himself, “Hello, I’m here.” 💔😭\n\nLENS &amp; EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT\n\nI feel that there are two main things to keep in mind, while adjusting your viewing lens for this show.\n\n1. Show’s tone is a touch farcical\n\nThis means that sometimes, things can get a little surreal and ridiculous.\n\n[MINOR EPISODE 1 SPOILER]\n\nLike in episode 1, when it comes to Deok Jin (Kim Kang Hyun) and his toy mansion, and how he basically has a shoot-out with Dae Young (Lee Do Hyun), when he thinks newly young Dae Young is an intruder.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nIt’s all in good fun, though, and I found it rather amusing, once I got used to it.\n\n2. Certain common sense rules don’t apply\n\nWhat I mean is, as various characters come to know Dae Young’s secret, they tend to accept it without a lot of fuss, whereas in a normal world, this would be a really bizarre thing that would require a lot more convincing.\n\nThis is a bit weird, to be sure, but while I do wish this was treated with a bit more realism, this is, after all, a fantasy story, and if glossing over characters’ reactions to Dae Young being 18 again gives us more screen time for heartwarming things [MINOR VAGUE SPOILER] like Dae Young doing heart-melty things just lovin’ on his family in his stoic anonymous way, [END SPOILER] I can absolutely live with that.\n\nSTUFF I LIKED\n\nFor the record, I liked a lot of things about this show, so much so that I find it impossible to talk about them all. There are some characters that I liked, like Shi Woo, who don’t get their own section in this category.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I don’t like them; I just need to draw the line somewhere. 😅\n\nLee Do Hyun as Dae Young\n\nThis is the drama that I didn’t know I wanted, for Lee Do Hyun. Boy is SO GOOD in this.\n\nI mean, I’d been impressed with him in Hotel Del Luna, but I’d kept in mind that he only debuted in 2017, and so might need more time to gain more acting experience and work his way up to a meaty lead role.\n\nBut here he is, blowing my socks off, from beginning to end, with acting skill and range that I didn’t know he had. 🤩\n\nTo be honest, when I’d first seen the casting news of this show, I’d had doubts, because in my head, Lee Do Hyun is nothing like Yoon Sang Hyun. And yet, Lee Do Hyun channels Yoon Sang Hyun’s interpretation of Dae Young is every way.\n\nFrom the way he walks, to the cadence of his speech, to the tone of his voice, to the slightly wild, slightly shifty look in his eyes, to his body language, he just morphs into Dae Young for me. I am so impressed.\n\nI just love-love-love Lee Do Hyun as newly young Dae Young. He’s fantastic at channeling adult Dae Young, and I can totally believe that it’s Yoon Sang Hyun in his body, controlling his body language and speech patterns.\n\nAlso, there is a difference between young Dae Young, and go-around-for-a-second-youth Dae Young. Newly young Dae Young feels like an adult at heart, whereas original young Dae Young feels like a teenager.\n\nThat’s really well done, and even though I’ve seen Lee Do Hyun do very nicely in Hotel Del Luna, I’m still blown away.\n\nAs a shallow fangirl aside, can I just say how GOOD Lee Do Hyun looks? He looks so strong and athletic, not in a “I pumped iron at the gym” way, but in a way that demonstrates strength, functionality and agility. I can’t help but spazz, at least a little bit. Cough. 😍🤩😍\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1. I love how fiercely Dae Young cares for his kids. I was completely sucked into his fatherly outburst at the convenience store, when he realized that his daughter Shi Ah (Noh Jung Ui) was working part-time without permission, but more than that, my heart surged with emotion, when he firmly stepped in and stood up for his son, who’s being bullied at school.\n\nDae Young – or should I say Woo Young? – is new at school, and hasn’t even fully remembered what it’s like to be a student, and he’s still making mistakes, but nothing stops him from standing up for his son, and – MY GOODNESS – I loves it.\n\nThere’s a fierceness (and a deep sense of badassery!) in the way he catches the hard-tossed basketball so effortlessly with just one hand, and yet, at the same time, there’s a steady groundedness about him, that speaks of adult maturity, rather than youthful impulsiveness.\n\nI’m finding this quite a heady combination, and I am looking forward to more measured fierceness from Woo Young, very soon.\n\nE2. What strikes me most about young Dae Young, is that he’s most concerned for his kids.\n\nHe has a chance to relive his life and make new choices and pursue his basketball dreams, and yet, the thing that is of utmost importance to him, is being there for his kids, whom he realizes he doesn’t know very well at all.\n\nAugh. His father’s heart really gets to me, in the best way.\n\nE3. The thing that strikes me most this episode, is how Dae Young gives his all, to protect those that matter to him.\n\nSometimes, it’s at his own expense, where protecting them means not protecting himself, and sometimes, he isn’t truly able to protect them, but whatever the case is, he does it wholeheartedly, and this all-in demonstration of love and care for his loved ones, just gets me right in the heart.\n\nE3. Gosh, I love the basketball showdown between Dae Young and Ja Sung (Hwang In Yeop). First of all, I can’t help but squee at the fact that Lee Do Hyun clearly is quick and nimble on his feet. He moves with such agility, so effortlessly, that I am convinced of his athletic prowess.\n\nSecond of all, I love – like super love – that he doesn’t win by taking over and making it a one man show. He wins through enabling and empowering Shi Woo (Ryeo Un) to shine.\n\nAnd then, when everyone rallies around Shi Woo to congratulate him, Dae Young looks on with pride, murmuring that Shi Woo really is his son.\n\nI mean, seriously. This is such a Heart. Burst. moment for me. LOVE. 😍\n\nE7. Every time Dae Young does his anonymous dad or husband thing, by being there for his kids and for Da Jung, and helping them and supporting them, it fills my heart so, to see him look at them with such quiet satisfaction.\n\nHe doesn’t need them to know that he is who he is; he gets joy and fulfillment just from being there for them, even if it’s anonymously, and that is so pure. I love.\n\nE8. The way Dae Young comforts Ja Sung is so empathetic and kind. It’s clear that he means it when he says he just doesn’t want Ja Sung to do something he’ll regret.\n\nMore importantly, he also offers Ja Sung something that Ja Sung craves and needs – affirmation that he is a skilled player, and doesn’t need his father to pay for him to play. And, it’s clear that Dae Young’s words carry weight with Ja Sung, because Ja Sung knows how good Dae Young is.\n\nAw. That was really more than enough, for me. But Show goes one further, and has Dae Young carry a passed out Ja Sung home on his back, and tuck him into bed. The heartwarming feels! 🥰\n\nE9. I am growing more and more smitten with Lee Do Hyun as Dae Young, this episode.\n\nDae Young seems to have found a place where he’s content; he’s not actively trying to get Da Jung (Kim Ha Neul) back, he’s just doing everything he can, to care for Da Jung and the kids, from where he is, as Woo Young.\n\nThere’s no hint that he’s trying to get back into their lives. In this way, it kind of feels like he’s accepting this consequence as his penance for not being the kind of husband and father that he’d actually wanted to be. That quiet acceptance gives Dae Young an extra layer of gravitas, I feel like.\n\nThat weightiness about him, combined with his youthful good looks, is quite a heady combination, I have to admit.\n\nE9. That opening scene, where Dae Young focuses drawing Da Jung’s attention to how well Shi Woo played, is so melty. There’s no guile about him, at all. He just wants Da Jung to feel proud of Shi Woo, and I swoon.\n\nAnd then there’s how he kneels down to tie Da Jung’s shoelace for her. Again, there is no calculatedness in his behavior. When he looks up at her, his eyes are so clear and pure, and his slight smile, so kind.\n\nFlail. Puddle.\n\nE10. One of the things that really gets me in the heart, about Dae Young, is how singleminded he is, in loving Da Jung, even though they’re now divorced, and he’s stuck in a younger body.\n\nHe doesn’t take the opportunity to leave his past behind and start a new life because he now inexplicably has a second chance at living his youth.\n\nHe just keeps loving on Da Jung and his kids, and it melts me into a big puddle. Dae Young looks legitimately disappointed when he realizes that he’s still in his young body, and the dream, where he’d been older, but surrounded by his family, isn’t real.\n\nHe looks so wistful and disappointed, honestly.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nYoon Sang Hyun as Dae Young\n\nTo be honest, Yoon Sang Hyun gets a lot less screen time than Lee Do Hyun in this show, but he deserves just as much credit, for helping to make Dae Young pop, as a character.\n\nWord on the street is that he and Lee Do Hyun worked closely to ensure as seamless a delivery of Dae Young as a character as possible.\n\nThis means that he may not have been on our screen as much of the time as Lee Do Hyun, but he deserves a good chunk of the credit too, for the wonderful iteration of Dae Young that we got.\n\nWhen Yoon Sang Hyun does appear on our screens, a lot of the time, he doesn’t get to say a lot, so most of his emotions are conveyed through his gaze.\n\nMajor shout-out to his very expressive eye acting, because even when he barely says a word, his feelings are so clear to see.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE6. I love that flashback to when Da Jung had practiced at home, while Dae Young had looked on. The look on his face, of proud, supportive affection, as he watches Da Jung, is so melty and heartwarming.\n\nE6. That final scene in the epilogue, where he watches (well, imagines, I suppose) Da Jung eating the snacks that he brought, is so quietly emotional.\n\nI can feel his heart surge with all kinds of complicated feelings; wistfulness; love and care; a measure of sad satisfaction; regret; it’s all there, in his eyes. Augh.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nKim Ha Neul as Da Jung\n\nI really enjoyed Da Jung as a character, and Kim Ha Neul’s delivery of her.\n\nConsidering that I’ve only ever seen Kim Ha Neul in 2012’s A Gentleman’s Dignity, where I found her performance pretty meh, I have to say I’m very pleasantly surprised.\n\nI guess the fault really was more with the writing than the acting, in AGD. I’d found Kim Ha Neul rather bland in AGD, but I can honestly say that I really, really enjoyed her in this show.\n\nI loved Da Jung as a character. I loved how caring, sensible and capable she is. She doesn’t have it easy in life, but she always strives to keep her chin up, and she always strives to be empathetic and kind, even when dealing with people who don’t deserve it.\n\nI also love that she’s brave. She doesn’t always feel brave, but she consistently steels herself to be her strongest self, for the sake of her kids, and I always felt so proud of her, for that.\n\nDa Jung wears many hats in our story; she’s wife, mother, daughter, daughter-in-law, co-worker, professional and friend, and I rooted for her to find success and happiness, in each and every one of those roles, because she deserves all of it.\n\nShe’s just that awesome. ❤️\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE2. I enjoy the fact that Da Jung is good at her job, and wows the interviewers with what looks like an effortless screen test. She’s quick on her feet and unruffled in the face of unexpected developments. She’s great; I’d have given her the job too.\n\nE3. The ending of the previous episode was a fake-out, ha. I actually appreciate that Da Jung doesn’t land on the conclusion that Woo Young is Dae Young, because that is really not a logical conclusion.\n\nI think her conclusion, that Woo Young must be Dae Young’s hidden son, is a logical one, and even though Dae Young’s insulted by the assumption, I like it because it shows that Da Jung’s a rational thinker.\n\nE3. It sucks that Da Jung’s facing discrimination at work because of her age and because she’s a mom; that’s supremely unfair. I hate that Director Moon (Ahn Nae Sang) even gives an explicit order that Manager Heo (Jang Hyuk Jin) make sure she quits by the end of her probation period.\n\nBUT. OMIGOSH I’m so happy for Da Jung, that she gets a chance to prove how awesome she is, when she does the live interview at the last minute.\n\nShe’s poised, quick on her feet, witty and personable, and it’s no wonder everyone loves her. It’s such a bummer that someone posts nasty comments about her being a teen mom, and the viral positivity quickly turns to viral negativity.\n\nUrgh. I really hope things turn around for Da Jung again, coz she’s awesome.\n\nI do very much love, though, that seeing how awesome his mom is on TV, gives Shi Woo the courage to go after his dreams too. That’s so great.\n\nE4. I love Da Jung’s independent, resilient streak. She’s not growing hearts in her eyes for Ji Hoon (like I am); instead, she tells him that she’ll take care of herself, thankyouverymuch, and then she does just that.\n\nI am impressed with how she refuses to let the jibes and discrimination get her down. Instead, she gets in there and rescues her younger colleagues from the tipsy wolves, and then proceeds to entertain the wolves with her drinking tricks and skills, keeping them happy and distracted.\n\nPlus, there’s the way she’s able to shut down the advances of the insistent drunks. Dae Young steps in to rescue her, it’s true, but it’s her sharp analysis of how the drunks are at a disadvantage, that makes them go away. Da Jung’s pretty darn great, and I can totally see that this is where Shi Ah gets it from.\n\nE5. I am pleased that Da Jung is so level-headed about Il Kwon’s (Lee Ki Woo) advances. Even though he pulls out the stops and lays it on thick, with his words, his actions and his money, she won’t give him even an inch, and is quick to set him straight when he does things that make her uncomfortable.\n\nBonus points for speaking up for her estranged husband too, when Il Kwon tries to put him down in front of her. She’s a queen, and it’s charming that she doesn’t even seem to know this.\n\nE7. I am pleased that Da Jung doesn’t take Il Kwon’s threats lying down and basically shuts it down and walks out. I did think her effort to record evidence was very ill thought-out. Why would she place her mobile on the table, if she’s doing a stealth recording? I really thought Da Jung would be savvier than that.\n\nE11. Da Jung kills the live broadcast, just like I knew she would, and I feel extra gratified, that the naysayers around her – in particular, Director Moon – are so impressed with her.\n\nWhat really hits me in the heart and strikes me as extra poignant, though, is how Da Jung’s success in this live broadcast comes from the fact that her past hurts are laid bare for all to see.\n\nShe reacts with unflinching open-heartedness when her own divorce is dragged into the picture, which is what wins the audience over, and while I’m very proud of her, I also feel my heart pinch for her. In a manner of speaking, it’s a success that feels born of pain, so to my eyes, it feels hard-won, at a painful price.\n\nI am very proud of Da Jung for having the courage to be honest in her feelings about her divorce, admitting that she does have regrets. It’s clear that after all this time, she’s had time to think about things from Dae Young’s perspective, and understand him a little better.\n\nE13. Da Jung’s consistently so level-headed (despite her confusion around Woo Young). I appreciate the way she seeks out Deok Jin to apologize for what’s happened between her and his “son.”\n\nThat’s such a responsibly adult thing to do.\n\nE13. I love how badass Da Jung is, in taking down the PD who’s taking upskirt videos of Yu Mi (Kim Yoon Hye).\n\nThe moment she’s sure of what he’s doing, she doesn’t hesitate. She’s not afraid of making a scene, and even when she’s told that he’s the PD who grades all the anchors, she doesn’t back down.\n\nThat’s so principled of her, and I am touched by her explanation, that she thought of her own daughter, when she moved to take down the PD. Truly a mother rises above so many fears, for the sake of her children.\n\nE13. It sucks that Da Jung gets replaced as her show’s MC, when the show becomes a regular program. That’s so unfair.\n\nI’m mollified, though, that Manager Heo is now firmly and openly on her side. I also admire Da Jung for speaking up firmly and graciously to the PD, not about being replaced, because that can always happen, but about the lack of communication.\n\nE13. I continue to appreciate Da Jung; the way she defends Shi Ah against the store manager who insists that Shi Ah had taken money from the cash register is so grounded and reasonable, while still demonstrating belief and trust in Shi Ah.\n\nAlso, for a mom who’s been blindsided by her daughter’s secret part-time job, I’d say that Da Jung handles it reasonably well.\n\nShe does lose her cool for a bit, but it really isn’t long before she’s having a conciliatory conversation with Shi Ah, telling Shi Ah that she’s not a burden, and that she trusts her and will support her desire to be a makeup artist.\n\nThat girl-talk session initiated by Gran (Kim Mi Kyung) is just the best icing on this cake. Aw.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nDae Young &amp; his kids\n\nThe fatherly love is so strong in this show, that I felt it deserved its own section.\n\nMore often than not, Dae Young’s love for his kids grabbed my heart harder, and made me choke up, even more than the main loveline.\n\nI truly loved watching Dae Young love on his kids, whether it’s in the flashbacks when they were little munchkins, or in the present, when he’s loving them incognito as their schoolmate Woo Young.\n\nIt’s all such heartwarming, wrap-me-up-in-a-blanket goodness, and I loved every minute of it. ❤️\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE3. Augh. Dae Young running to the convenience store in the rain so that he can buy umbrellas for his kids, just make my heart squeeze. That’s such a loving, fatherly thing to do, to give the umbrellas to his kids, while going without himself – with a satisfied smile, too.\n\nThat is so, so sweet. I LUFF HIM. ❤️\n\nE3. The epilogue flashback to how Dae Young had taken care of his kids as a young father, is so great. I love how happy the twins are, even after Dae Young had drawn the wrong whiskers on them. And I am hit in the heart all over again, when I see Dae Young using his umbrella to shelter his kids, while he himself walks in the rain.\n\nThis man may not have a lot, but he loves his kids with all that he has, and I flail with hearts in my eyes. 😍\n\nE4. I still love how protective Dae Young is of his kids. The way he puts Shi Ah on his back and just runs to the nearest hospital without a second thought, fills my heart so. He does all these fatherly things for Shi Ah, like buying her food, and asking if she’s in any kind of trouble, it’s such a pity that she has no idea that he’s her dad.\n\nIt’s really heartbreaking that while Dae Young is doing all these things to take care of Shi Ah, both Da Jung and Shi Ah lament his absence and reiterate that he was never there when he needed them. That’s sad and frustrating.\n\nE8. The flashback to how Dae Young’s mom (Jo Ryun) had hidden her illness from him is heartbreaking. She and Dad (Lee Byung Joon) had wanted to protect Dae Young, but those good intentions had eventually hurt him instead.\n\nStill, that doesn’t dilute the sacrificial love that drove that decision. Dae Young’s despair at the morgue, as he sees Mom’s body, is completely heartrending; I feel so sorry for him, that he never got to say goodbye.\n\nAnd as it turns out, Dad feels sorry too, and proceeds to delay his visit to Mom’s grave on each of her death anniversaries, so that Dae Young can have the space to see her first.\n\nThis is such a poignant picture of a parent’s love; it’s full of regret of all the decisions that didn’t work out, but also, still full of consideration for the child for which that love flows.\n\nIt’s so poignant that Dae Young now realizes that all this time that he’d wanted to be different from his father, he’d actually been walking in his father’s exact footsteps.\n\nIt’s only with hindsight and experience, that Dae Young finally understands his father better, and his silent wistfulness, as he spends a bit of time with his father now, as Woo Young, is full of growing pathos.\n\nI love how this galvanizes Dae Young to be there extra for Shi Woo, even though he has to do so as Woo Young. Dae Young’s love for Shi Woo is so clear to see. When Shi Woo’s name had first been called as part of the line-up, Dae Young’s proud side-eye is so beautiful to see.\n\nAnd then, when they win the game and Shi Woo hugs him – omigosh – his feels just overflow. The flashbacks that we see, in his mind’s eye, of Shi Woo hugging him as a little kid, are so poignant, and Dae Young’s tears, full of wistfulness, wonderment and gratitude, move my heart so. 😭❤️\n\nE10. I love how fierce Dae Young is, when he comes to Shi Ah’s rescue, and I’m amused at the brawl that everyone gets into at the police station, because they’re so protective of Shi Ah, and so offended that anyone would dare stalk and attack her.\n\nMy favorite moment was when Mom showed up and joined in the fray. Kim Mi Kyung rocks. And how awkward-funny, that Dae Young slips, addressing her as “mother-in-law,” thus creating the impression that Woo Young likes Shi Ah. 😂 Oops.\n\nE10. What I appreciate about Show’s handling of this, is how Show always brings it back to the father-daughter dynamic. In the scene where Dae Young plays the guitar, and we see Shi Ah gazing at him with rising emotion in her eyes, I half wondered whether Show would toy with her having a crush on Woo Young.\n\nBut no. Show stays true to its path, and makes it about Shi Ah’s memories of her and Dad Dae Young, singing to her as he played the guitar. This definitely earned Show extra brownie points with me.\n\nE12. I also want to say, I really appreciate how Lee Do Hyun plays the way Dae Young takes care of the kids in his class.\n\nEven when we see scenes of him being nice to Bo Bae (Oh So Hyun), there’s a distinct lack of guile about him, to the extent that when Bo Bae decides that he must like her, I immediately conclude that it must all be in her head, because Dae Young clearly hadn’t said anything special or looked at her in any special way, and had maintained quite a distinctly fatherly manner when he’d been nice to her.\n\nI really like Show’s approach to this.\n\nOn a similar note, I really like that during the times when Dae Young is being nice to Shi Ah and the other kids all assume he must like her romantically, the only thing that his actions stir up in Shi Ah, is memories of her Dad.\n\nI find this very touching, really. And it goes back to this episode’s theme, that just because she can’t see him, doesn’t mean Dad’s not there.\n\nE12. I do love that Dae Young is so happy at the fact that Shi Ah’s ready to be good friends with him. Aw. That’s such a father’s heart, right there. 🥰\n\nE13. Gosh, I really do love that arc of Dae Young learning that Shi Ah doesn’t want to go to college, and wants to be a makeup artist instead.\n\nHe’s clearly a little dismayed at first, but his time as Woo Young, being around Shi Ah, has taught him to trust her and listen to her, which results in that lovely conversation that they have. His gentle, non-judgmental approach to her is wonderfully open and patient; something that he wouldn’t have been able to achieve, if he’d never become Woo Young.\n\nAlso, there’s a loving sense of appreciation about him as he looks upon her, which I love. ❤️\n\nE13. Augh. One of the most touching scenes this episode, is when Shi Ah finally sees the remarks that Dae Young had put in each of his bank book entries for Shi Ah’s savings account.\n\nIf Shi Ah had had any doubts about how precious she is to her father, this definitely clears them all away. The remarks are so detailed, so tender and so loving. I love that she later calls Dae Young to tell him that she misses him.\n\nHer tears and Dae Young’s tears in return, made me legit want to cry. Gurgle. 😭❤️\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nYoung Dae Young &amp; Da Jung together\n\nEven though we spend most of our story with Dae Young and Da Jung in the present, I wanted to give our young high school couple a section of their own, because I found their arc very poignant, and also because I felt that these flashback scenes provide a lot of important context for our present-day characters.\n\nTeenage Dae Young and Da Jung (Han So Eun) find themselves in a very difficult situation at such a young age, and it’s heartbreaking but also comforting, to see how brave they are to make the choices they make, and how hard they try to make things work, for each other’s sakes. They may be young, but their love and resilience is quite profound.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE1. The way Da Jung, 1, tries to be considerate to Dae Young about his big game, when she first found out she was pregnant, and 2, fought so hard to keep her babies, really won me over.\n\nShe is more concerned for his future than for her own, and that makes me feel like Dae Young makes the right choice, giving up his basketball dreams, in order to be with her and their babies.\n\nE2. The sad wistfulness of young Dae Young and Da Jung, as they struggle to make ends meet as young parents, is so palpable.\n\nAnd it’s so very poignant to hear the scenes voiced over by adult Dae Young, who shares Da Jung’s favorite quote, “No matter how hard life gets, never regret anything that made you smile.”\n\nGah. That pretty much sums up their entire lives, doesn’t it? They’ve both given up so much for the sake of their kids, and yet, because their romance and their children have made them smile, they resolve not to regret anything.\n\nThat’s so moving, and so sad at the same time, because where we start our story, their lives are anything but easy.\n\nE3. In the opening flashback, Dae Young calls out to Da Jung, who’s being offered the pick of any boy and his umbrella, and she happily goes with him – but he has no umbrella, and they walk together happily, sheltered by his jacket, which he holds over their heads.\n\nIt occurs to me that this is a pretty apt metaphor for their young marriage. Dae Young doesn’t really have the proper means to provide for and protect Da Jung, but she goes with him happily anyway, and they journey together, both imperfectly protected from the elements.\n\nThis is quite a poignant thought to me; it feels like this imperfect protection, which exposes them to the elements, eventually contributes to their weariness, and the breakdown of their relationship. 💔\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nDae Young &amp; Da Jung together\n\nBeyond the theme of fatherly love, I really enjoyed the theme of seeing your loved one in a new light, and this main loveline brought that out really beautifully.\n\nI loved the idea of Dae Young and Da Jung getting to know each other all over again, and appreciating and falling for each other, all over again, and I eagerly lapped up each and every nugget of realization, healing and growth that Show serves up.\n\nI did come across some viewer sentiment on Twitter, that some viewers were uncomfortable seeing this kind of romantic tension between an adult woman and a high school boy, and I just wanted to state for the record that context really is everything.\n\nIn our story, Dae Young isn’t an actual high school boy; he’s an adult man who just happens to look like his high school self. His mind and heart are that of a mature man who longs for his (ex-)wife, and to me, that’s more than enough to neutralize the potential discomfort.\n\nI loved this loveline, and wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE2. That conversation where Da Jung advises young Dae Young not to drink or smoke if he wants to pursue his dreams, clearly hits Dae Young with a lot of feels.\n\nTheir marriage has been so strained for so long, that it feels refreshing and welcome, to have her express concern for him, even if she thinks she’s being naggy.\n\nE3. Ahaha. I love how spontaneously enthusiastic Dae Young is, at overhearing that Da Jung got her dream job as a newscaster.\n\nThe way he jumps in on the hug that she’s sharing with Shi Woo, is so cute. Da Jung had wondered whether he’d have been happy for her if he knew about her job; little does she know that he’s so happy for her that he just can’t contain it.\n\nHow does Show manage to be so cute and so poignant, in the very same moment?\n\nE4. I love that Dae Young’s advice to Shi Woo – to call Da Jung and ask if she’s doing ok – hits home so well. Even though Shi Woo laughs it off as being cringey, it really does comfort Da Jung a great deal.\n\nAnd I’m just so heartened on Dae Young’s behalf, because it shows that he really does understand Da Jung, after all.\n\nE4. Aw. Dae Young is a real sweetheart. I love that he basically goes to see Da Jung, to tell her not to let the gossip get her down, and to just focus on work, because he’ll look out for Shi Ah and Shi Woo in school. “I think you’re amazing, for being a mom who takes responsibility.”\n\nAhh. Such encouraging words. I’m sure they are a balm to Da Jung’s heart.\n\nE5. I do appreciate the way Show demonstrates the sincerity between Da Jung and Dae Young.\n\nThey sincerely did their best for their kids and for each other, and they’d sacrificed so much of their own dreams and their own selves, in order to take care of their kids; it’s understandable that they’d both feel the weariness and other people’s judgy-ness weigh on them over time.\n\nI appreciate that Dae Young is cognizant of the fact that he didn’t actually regret having met Da Jung, but that it was true that he’d blamed her for how his life had turned out.\n\nE5. I don’t wish divorce on anyone, least of all a couple that clearly cares about each other, but I appreciate the manner in which Dae Young handles the divorce, once he understands how he’s hurt Da Jung.\n\nThe “letter” that he “read” to her in the courthouse is so caring and full of wistful regret and contemplative appreciation; he is clear that he doesn’t want to let her go, but he also acknowledges that perhaps letting her go is the best thing that he can do for her.\n\nI choked up at his well wishes to her, because of the selfless, caring, empathetic spirit in which they’re given.\n\nAnd I feel sorry for them both, because as we see in the aftermath, it’s not easy for either of them. Dae Young’s dispirited and Da Jung is scared, and I want to hug them both and tell them it’s going to be ok.\n\nE6. A lot of the poignance comes from Dae Young finally seeing Da Jung and her struggles so clearly now that he’s in her orbit as her son’s friend, and ironically, being unable to do much for her because he’s no longer her husband, and she only sees him as a kid.\n\nDespite his limited options, Dae Young goes out of his way to help Da Jung in ways that he can. There’s the way he gets her shoes fixed, and how he thoughtfully buys slippers for her, even though he doesn’t give them to her because Ji Hoon’s already given her sneakers.\n\nAnd then there’s how he brings Da Jung’s favorite snack with him when he goes to the house with Shi Woo, and then does the dishes so that Da Jung won’t have to. Plus, there’s how he changes the light in the landing because he notices it flickering.\n\nAll his little gestures of care and concern are so sweet because of how sincere they are, and at the same time, they are so poignant because Da Jung has no idea that he’s doing these things for her, or that he does them out of love.\n\nDae Young thanking Da Jung for always caring about him, is so poignant, again, because he means so much more than what she thinks he means. Augh.\n\nE7. I do enjoy the moment that Da Jung and Dae Young share on the open staircase. He manages to encourage her, telling her things like, “It’s okay,” and “You did well,” without overstepping his boundaries as Shi Woo’s friend, AND while drawing on his understanding of Da Jung, as her husband.\n\nIt’s because of this, that Da Jung feels Dae Young’s presence, even in his absence, like she describes in her closing voiceover.\n\nE7. The thing that I’m looking forward to the most, I think, is Da Jung bonding with Woo Young, without knowing that he’s Dae Young.\n\nIn my mind, I think of it as them having another chance to enjoy each other’s company again, with the past hurts and misunderstandings taken out of the picture. Without the past coloring the way she sees him, I think Da Jung will find herself appreciating Dae Young much more, all over again. And I just like the idea of that.\n\nE9. I really like how understanding Dae Young’s become, of Da Jung. I think at the beginning of our story, Dae Young would have struggled to understand Da Jung considering the offer to host the program about divorce.\n\nBut now, after all that he’s learned about Da Jung – and after all that he’s remembered, too – he understands immediately that she wouldn’t consider it if she didn’t honestly think it was her last chance, and he also knows that if she made the decision to do it, it wouldn’t only be for her own sake, but for the sake of the kids too.\n\nEven Ae Rin (Lee Mi Do), who’s Da Jung’s best friend, fails to see this, and yet, Dae Young sees it immediately. This demonstrates so clearly just how far Dae Young has come, in understanding and supporting Da Jung.\n\nE9. How nice, that Dae Young gets to watch the fireworks with Da Jung. He just wants to see her, but he doesn’t know that she’d really wanted to have company that night, and it’s just really nice that he’s there for her.\n\nAnd how perfect, that he gives her the photos taken during her high school festival, and then shows her pictures of Shi Ah and Shi Woo on his phone. It feels like a very precious couple’s moment – except for the fact that Da Jung doesn’t realize that it’s Dae Young in front of her.\n\nBut still. It’s sweet.\n\nAnd from what he says, Dae Young hasn’t only gained understanding of Da Jung, he knows his kids better now too.\n\nLast but not least, I love how he encourages her, telling her that she’s a great mom who’s doing a great job of raising her kids, and that she’s inspiring to him and to her kids, when they see her on TV.\n\nIt really is what Da Jung needs to hear, and my heart swells with pride for Dae Young, because he’s so good at loving his family, whether they know it or not.\n\nE10. How touching, too, that Da Jung forwards the photos that she receives from Woo Young, to Dae Young, saying that she thought he’d like to see the kids.\n\nAw. Da Jung is so sweet and thoughtful. If only she knew that it was Dae Young who’d sent her those pictures in the first place, and that he’s been closer to her and the kids, than she could’ve imagined.\n\nE11. I found the exchange between Da Jung and Dae Young on the phone very true to life. The distance Da Jung’s had to think about things from Dae Young’s point-of-view, and the proximity that’s afforded Dae Young the same opportunity with regard to Da Jung, has softened them enough for both of them to want to reach out and connect.\n\nBut the reality is that there’s still a lot of baggage between them that hasn’t been resolved, so Dae Young not showing up when he’d said he would, is enough of a trigger to make Da Jung hang up curtly.\n\nI feel bad for both of them, but I’m sure that given a bit more time, they’ll feel kindly enough to want to connect again.\n\nE11. Talking about her divorce on live TV, combined with the post-broadcast gathering, creates the perfect set-up for a tipsy Da Jung to be overtly missing Dae Young, while she sits in her secret place, which is where Dae Young finds her.\n\nThere’s so much emotion on both sides, fresh from the contents of the live broadcast. I totally believe Da Jung’s desire to see Dae Young, and I fully understand Dae Young’s urge to kiss her.\n\nAugh. Such sweet, gentle, tender kisses. I melt. ❤️\n\nOn a fangirl tangent, I am decidedly transfixed by Lee Do Hyun’s very lovely jawline, in this scene. Spazz. 😍\n\nE12. I really do like the first kiss, on the stairwell. It’s so full of emotion, on both sides. Da Jung’s feelings of missing Dae Young, hitherto tamped down and kept under control, all come spilling out via her tears, as she looks at Woo Young before her, and sees her husband.\n\nAnd Dae Young’s feelings of missing Da Jung, all come rushing to the surface too, and his gaze is full, as he looks at her and drinks in the realization that in this moment, she sees him.\n\nAugh. The kiss itself is so gentle and tender, even though it is also tentative. It’s no wonder that Da Jung is haunted by the kiss the next day, which she tries to shake off as a dream.\n\nE12. I can’t help but swoon a little, when Dae Young catches a falling Da Jung in the bus. The way his arm just wraps around her back so instinctively, while looking all strong and lean, kinda takes my breath away. Puddle.\n\nE12. It’s sweet and thoughtful of Dae Young to remember Da Jung’s desire to have dinner at the fancy restaurant, and work a way out, for him to have dinner with her there. I am admittedly melted into a puddle, at the way he gazes at Da Jung.\n\nThere’s so much wistfulness and emotion in his gaze, and so much poignance in the fact that he can’t express himself plainly to Da Jung, even though she’s right there in front of him. The way he looks right at her and says, “How beautiful,” is so poignant and melty.\n\nIt’s a pity that he has to cover it up by saying that he’s was talking about the view.\n\nGuh. And then there’s how Dae Young leaves his umbrella behind on purpose, so that he has a reason to walk Da Jung home, while they share an umbrella. Dae Young really is going to great lengths just so that the can have a few extra moments with Da Jung, and all the while, she has no idea who he is, or what he feels for her.\n\nThere’s something so plaintive about that. 😭💔\n\nE12. On the swoony-tropey side of things, Dae Young whisks Da Jung out of the way of road splash, and again, I spazz at how his arm just instinctively wraps around her, so fully and so protectively. Like I said, this is totally tropey, but.. Meltz.\n\nE12. I laughed AND spazzed, while Da Jung scuttled away at the sight of Dae Young standing shirtless in her living room. Tee hee. I get a big kick out of Dae Young having such an effect on Da Jung, after all that he’s  been through with the divorce.\n\nE12. I love that Da Jung expresses that she doesn’t hate Dae Young, and in fact feels thankful to him, and hopes that he’s doing well. Her sad wistfulness as she says that, while looking upon the half moon, must mean so much to Dae Young.\n\nI can’t blame him for leaning in to take Da Jung by the hand, and kiss her.\n\nIt’s too bad that Da Jung pushes him away and slaps him, in shock. Eep. I guess I can’t blame her, though.\n\nE13. I appreciate how Dae Young’s desire to tell Da Jung the truth has been percolating for a while now.. He doesn’t have to say it; I feel like I can tell, from how the angst in his eyes has been building, that he really wishes he could tell her who he really is.\n\nSo it makes sense to me that after Da Jung slaps him and leaves in a mortified flurry, that he’d want to go after her, with the sole aim of telling her the truth.\n\nIt’s too bad that Ji Hoon shows up to put a stop to Dae Young’s confession. It’s certainly ironic that Ji Hoon is upset at Dae Young for being rude to Da Jung and tells him not to cross the line with Da Jung, when Dae Young’s really Da Jung’s husband – ok, ex-husband – and has more reason to tell Ji Hoon not to get involved.\n\nBut, I understand why Ji Hoon would act this way, given that to his eyes, Dae Young’s just a teenager with a crush that’s getting out of hand.\n\nE13. I still do enjoy the moments of hyper-proximity between Da Jung and Dae Young. That moment in the elevator, where the crowd of people conveniently squeeze Da Jung and Dae Young into a corner, where he shields her with his body without ever taking his eyes off her, was quite swoony to me.\n\nAlso, while it does feel a little tropey that Dae Young would run into so many roadblocks in his efforts to tell Da Jung the truth, I do appreciate that most of the time, he doesn’t get to finish what he wants to say, because he’s waiting for Da Jung to finish speaking.\n\nI mean, the fact that he listens without interrupting her, earns him a brownie point, yes?\n\nLast but not least, I do love that flashback that we see, where Dae Young hugs Da Jung in that little nook in the rain, telling her that she hasn’t changed a bit, and he thinks she’s the most beautiful woman in the world.\n\nIt’s no wonder Da Jung’s heart still does flutter for Dae Young from time to time, even though she tells Ae Rin that this kind of thing all stops after the wedding. Hee.\n\n[END SPOILERS]\n\nDae Young’s reconciliation with Dad\n\nDae Young’s arc with his dad is one of my favorite things in this show; it literally is an arc that I loved, but didn’t know I needed.\n\nI love that Show doesn’t only focus on the fatherly love that Dae Young has for his kids, but also takes time to flesh out and heal Dae Young’s own relationship with his father.\n\nThis arc made me ugly-cry and I love Show so much, for treating this arc with such tenderness and giving it such poignance and beauty.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE6. Dae Young’s estranged relationship with his father is really hits me in the heart. To think that they’ve been estranged for so many years, while Da Jung has, on her own, made amends with Dad.\n\nI find it touching that Da Jung and Dad have gotten along so warmly all this time, with Dad bringing Da Jung seaweed soup, and giving her money for expenses, and Da Jung getting Dad birthday gifts.\n\nAt the same time, I find it sad that Dae Young’s missed out on all these for so long, because he and Dad had fallen out when he’d refused to give up on Da Jung and the babies.\n\nSo to see Dae Young now take Dad’s bus, and defend Dad from the unreasonable passenger’s attacks, and then have dinner with Dad, is so poignant. Dae Young’s finally getting some time with his father – but Dad doesn’t even know that he’s eating with his son. Sniffle.\n\nE8. I love, so much, that Dae Young takes the lesson he learns in father-son love, and applies it right away, with his own dad.\n\nI love that he throws caution to the wind, walks right into Dad’s line of sight, and speaks to him in a way that makes him instantly recognizable – through the sign language that Mom used to teach.\n\nAugh. That moment, as dawning realization comes together in Dad’s mind, is so touching. And what Dae Young signs to Dad, with tears burgeoning in his eyes, is beautiful.\n\n“Dad, you said you were the happiest when you watch me play. I wanted to show you again. I’m sorry that it took me so long. I’m sorry, Dad.”\n\nWhat a wonderful, tearful reunion, as father and son embrace, while Dad tells Dae Young that he’s sorry too.\n\nAugh. My heart. It’s so full that I want to cry. I LOVE. 😭❤️\n\nE9. Aw. I like how Dae Young and Dad are spending time together, and getting to know each other again, bit by bit. I found it quite poignant that they’d talk about the foods they like, because it reminds me that they’ve literally lost touch for decades.\n\nAlso, it’s very meaningful that Dae Young learns from Dad, how much Da Jung’s done to care for Dad all this time. Dae Young’s sad, wistful gaze as he watches Da Jung from across the road, makes my heart squeeze in sympathy.\n\nHe must feel like she’s so near, and yet so far, and he must have so much that he wants to say to her, now that he knows how much she’s done for his dad.\n\nE11. I love the scene of Dae Young sitting with Dad, as Dad eats the dumplings Dae Young brought him, and father and son chat.\n\nIt’s a simple thing that seems mundane, but is just the kind of small conversation that this father and son pair missed out on, all the years that they were estranged.\n\nIt warms my heart a great deal, to see them bonding now, even though it’s a bit weird that Dad doesn’t ask how Dae Young became young again.\n\nBut this is such a heartwarming arc that I’ll just roll with it.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nWi Ha Joon as Ji Hoon\n\nI have to confess that I was a little apprehensive when Show introduced Ji Hoon into our story. Would he end up being a jerk who breaks Da Jung’s heart, I wondered. After all, Show introduces him as quite the player among the ladies.\n\nAnd yet, I couldn’t help myself; I kept growing heart eyes for Wi Ha Joon, especially when Ji Hoon looks at Da Jung appreciatively and leaks smiles around her.\n\nI couldn’t help being quite charmed. 😅 (I need Wi Ha Joon to star in his own rom-com already, I think he’d be great.)\n\nI needn’t have worried, because Ji Hoon turns out to be such a decent, good, loyal kinda guy, that I would’ve totally shipped him with Da Jung, if Da Jung weren’t still in love with Dae Young.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE5. Because Ji Hoon is kind to Da Jung and wishes her well on her new start, with her divorce, I am tempted to think well of him. But I do remember that we were first introduced to him as a player with multiple women problems, and therefore I’m wary.\n\nFor now, he seems believably pleased to see Da Jung, and I’m curious to see how this unfolds. Dae Young’s indignant protectiveness is rather amusing, since Da Jung and Ji Hoon pretty much just see him as a kid.\n\nE7. I didn’t expect Ji Hoon’s story to be such a heart-tugging one, to be honest. I’d thought that his daughter must’ve been the result of one of his past relationships, especially with him being introduced as a character with a playboy sort of image. So when Show reveals that this is his brother’s daughter, whom he’s adopted in honor of his hyung’s (Im Ji Kyu) memory, I found it quite affecting.\n\nI mean, first, Hyung’s given up so much in order to take care of Ji Hoon, and he’s never whispered a word of complaint about it, even when his longtime girlfriend (Song Yoo Hyun) left him.\n\nAnd then, Hyung welcomes being a single dad with such grateful joy, while he continues to support Ji Hoon’s career aspirations so wholeheartedly. But, Hyung dies in a car crash while leaving a warm holiday greeting message on Ji Hoon’s mobile?\n\nAugh. That’s the stuff of classic Hallyu melos; it’s all so heartbreaking.\n\nBut it does grab me by the heart, and I can totally understand Ji Hoon’s decision to adopt Hyung’s daughter as his own, to honor Hyung, and carry on in Hyung’s selfless, loving footsteps.\n\nWith this new context painted in, I feel more empathetic towards Ji Hoon than ever, and I’m also really glad that he has a friend in Da Jung, who’s not only able to empathize with him as a fellow single parent, but is also able to give him parenting tips on how to engage with and bond with his new daughter (Yoon Byul Ha).\n\nAt first, I wondered at Ji Hoon contemplating retirement over the news of his daughter, since everything could be easily cleared up with a press conference, but his consideration for her privacy put things into perspective for me.\n\nHe doesn’t have to, but he’s actually thinking of giving up his career – something that he’s worked for practically all his life – so that he can protect his daughter, and that’s so selfless and sacrificial.\n\nTruly, you don’t need biological ties in order to be a parent. I’m glad, though, that Da Jung gives him an alternative point-of-view, and effectively puts the brakes on his intention to retire.\n\nE8. I’m growing fond of Ji Hoon. I like the way he carries himself at the press conference. He’s honest and down-to-earth, and is respectful and protective of his daughter, even as he tells everyone the truth.\n\nI’m glad he’s taking Da Jung’s advice to heart and choosing to carry on instead of retire.\n\nSo handsome. 😍\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI actually really like how Ji Hoon is, in the way he approaches Da Jung. He isn’t pushy, but he does push the envelope ever so gently, when he thinks Da Jung would be ok with it.\n\nAnd when Da Jung resists, he always backs off like a gentleman, while showing shades of good-natured disappointment.\n\nIf I didn’t feel convinced that Da Jung still loves Dae Young, I’d be so on board with her dating Ji Hoon.\n\nE9. Ji Hoon sitting down at the restaurant in order to listen in on Da Jung’s conversation with Ae Rin, so that he can figure out why she looks so despondent, is technically rather stalkery. However, because of the very benign way that he uses the information that he gains, I’m willing to look past it.\n\nThe way he pops up in front of Da Jung, saying that he was hoping to run into her, persuades her to go with him to dinner, and then orders a super spicy dish that he can barely stomach, just to help her feel better, is pretty dorky-sweet, I have to admit.\n\nAlso, how perfect, that he asks Da Jung for her first autograph, saying that he’s her number one fan. It’s just the kind of thing to boost Da Jung’s flagging spirits. He’s a good egg.\n\nE10. We see more of Ji Hoon’s struggle to connect with his new daughter, and I feel rather sorry for him, because he’s trying really hard, but consistently hitting a wall every time he tries to be her dad. I’m glad he finds help, support and solidarity with Da Jung.\n\nDa Jung really is great with Seo Yeon; her experience with her own kids really shows. I can totally see how this would make Ji Hoon fall for Da Jung even more.\n\nE12. Ji Hoon is still smiling and patient with Dae Young, but it’s clear that his patience is wearing a little thin, especially in that twin shirtless scene – Wowza, Wi Ha Joon is in excellent shape; I mean, look at his back and shoulders, ahemm – where Ji Hoon tells Dae Young that he should stop pursuing Da Jung.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nTreatment of the love triangle\n\nShow serves up a love triangle that is quite possibly the healthiest one I’ve seen yet, in Dramaland.\n\nThere’s much more patience, grace and respect in this love triangle than I’d imagined possible, and I really like how Show does this – by showing us that nobody’s a villain in this, but each person is sincere, within their own context.\n\nI really appreciated Show’s approach with this love triangle. It feels so.. grown up.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE6. That moment when Da Jung falls down and strains her ankle, and she declines Dae Young’s offer of help, only to accept the same offer from Ye Ji Hoon just a few moments later, really hits it home for Dae Young, I think.\n\nThe expression on his face, as he takes in the scene of Ji Hoon helping Da Jung up, feels complicated. I feel like he feels jealousy and indignation, but there’s also helplessness, and at the same time, a measure of grudging respect for Ji Hoon, who’s able to help Da Jung, when he himself cannot.\n\nThe friendship between Ji Hoon and Da Jung feels sincere and genuine, which I’m slightly surprised by. I suppose it’s because when we were first introduced to Ji Hoon, Show indicated that he had a reputation as a player.\n\nBut so far, in his interactions with Da Jung, even though he shows interest in her, that interest feels genuine. It doesn’t feel like he’s flirting with her; it feels like he sincerely wants to get to know her better.\n\nThat scene at the end of the episode where he gets her to hit the ball he pitches, and then encourages her to apply the same “keep trying” principle in life, is pretty nice. His advice feels friendly and kind, and the high that Da Jung gets from successfully hitting the ball, is just what she needs.\n\nAnd then with this episode’s reveal, that he’s a single father too, he and Da Jung have more in common than they’d thought. Especially since the public isn’t taking well to the news.\n\nThat is definitely a point on which they share empathy and solidarity, and I can’t say I’m mad about that.\n\nE10. It’s so poignant that we see in the epilogue, that the description Dae Young had given Shi Woo about Da Jung, pretty much echoes what we hear Ji Hoon say in the interview, when he’s asked about his ideal woman.\n\nThat look in Dae Young’s eyes, as he looks at Ji Hoon and Da Jung standing together, tells me that he feels sad and wistful, but he’s also cognizant and respectful of the fact that Ji Hoon sees Da Jung accurately, for all the lovely qualities that she possesses.\n\nGiven how Dae Young’s learning to love Da Jung and care for her in a selfless manner, I wouldn’t be surprised if he felt that Da Jung deserved to meet a good man, and Ji Hoon could well be that man.\n\nE11. Feelings can be very complicated things, so I still stand by my observation that Dae Young showed traces of grudging respect for Ji Hoon last episode, for being able to see Da Jung’s lovely qualities so accurately, even though his reaction to Ji Hoon this episode skews jealous, competitive and petty.\n\nI do appreciate how pleasant Ji Hoon is about it, because he thinks of Dae Young as a kid, and not as real competition.\n\nI’m pretty sure not every man would be as gracious, Dae Young presenting as a teenager notwithstanding, so Ji Hoon does get brownie points from me for that.\n\nAlso, Dae Young may be acting petty jealous, but from the way he asks Ji Hoon if he treats all the women the same way, it also seems like he’s cognizant of the fact that Da Jung has the freedom to like Ji Hoon.\n\nIt seems to me that at the very minimum, Dae Young wants to make sure that Ji Hoon isn’t a player, and is being sincere with Da Jung.\n\nE13. I feel bad for Ji Hoon for being rejected by Da Jung; he really is a very good, decent, loyal person who would make a great boyfriend.\n\nFor that reason, I feel bad for him, because his feelings for Da Jung have always been sincere, and he’s always been so supportive and appreciative of her.\n\nI think the way Da Jung turns him down is the most gentle and appreciative manner possible, but it must still be so disappointing for Ji Hoon.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nSpecial shout-outs:\n\nAe Rin and Da Jung’s friendship\n\nI really like the fact that Da Jung and Ae Rin have been besties for so long.\n\nEven though their lives have turned out very differently, it doesn’t prevent them from continuing to be best friends, who make time for each other, and confide in each other, and defend, comfort or scold each other, as the need arises.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nIt’s quite funny how Ae Rin and Da Jung become best friends, in episode 4, because Ae Rin had started out bullying Da Jung because Dae Young liked Da Jung.\n\nFirst of all, it’s cool how Da Jung had held her own so well that Ae Rin and her friends had come out of it worse for wear, and second of all, it’s even cooler that they became friends because Da Jung had then saved Ae Rin from a group of girls who’d been bullying her.\n\nHa. The irony.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nKim Mi Kyung as Da Jung’s mom\n\nI love Kim Mi Kyung, and I love Kim Mi Kyung as Da Jung’s mom.\n\nOn a shallow note, I love that Kim Mi Kyung has her hair in a nice full blowout, in this role. I mean, it’s a small detail, but she mostly has a more practical, plain, almost dowdy appearance in most of her roles, so it gives me a bit of a thrill to see her with her hair nicely full and styled, and wearing makeup, for no reason at all.\n\nShe’s Da Jung’s mom, but that doesn’t mean that she has to look plain, and I love that. 🤩\n\nMom provides the perfect amount of warmth and grounding that Da Jung and Dae Young need, and even though we don’t get a whole lot of screen time with Mom, Show makes every scene count.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE6. I love the hug that Mom and Da Jung share; Da Jung’s been having a hard time, and I just feel my heart get full on her behalf, as she receives Mom’s warmth.\n\nE8. I love how Mom reinforces that Da Jung will always be her daughter, and that she’ll always be on Da Jung’s side. It’s a short scene, but it’s truly so pure and loving, and it’s exactly what Da Jung needs to hear from her mom. ❤️\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nNoh Jung Ui as Shi Ah\n\nTo be honest, I found Noh Jung Ui’s delivery of Shi Ah a little patchy, ie, some scenes were better than others, but I just wanted to give Shi Ah a shout-out because I think she’s a pretty awesome character.\n\nI realize that I really like how self-possessed and mature she can be, even though she’s only 18.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE4. I like how fierce Shi Ah can be. With the way she faces off with Ja Sung, she’s completely confident and self possessed, and even a little badass.\n\nI can totally see Ja Sung falling for her – which I’m sure he is. Also, there’s how she is quick to protect her boundaries, when she wakes up in the hospital to Dae Young stroking her hair. I like that she’s so capable of defending herself.\n\nE11. How considerate of Shi Ah, to think of Ja Sung’s reputation, when she decided not to turn him down publicly.\n\nShi Ah may appear a touch rebellious and stubborn, but she’s more mature than I’d originally given her credit for.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nHwang In Yeop as Ja Sung\n\nFor a character who’s introduced to us as a bully, I’m pleasantly surprised by how Show manages to endear Ja Sung to us, by the end of our story.\n\nI found myself growing sympathetic towards Ja Sung in degrees, which is something I hadn’t expected. Nicely played, Show.\n\nI also thought Hwang In Yeop delivered Ja Sung with a nice amount of nuance.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE5. I’m pleasantly surprised that Ja Sung demonstrates empathy for Shi Ah.\n\nEven though I still don’t like that he bullied Shi Woo, this new, encouraging side of him is a positive development. Importantly, even though I suspect that he’s nursing a romantic interest in Shi Ah, it doesn’t feel like his encouraging words are spoken in order to make her like him.\n\nTo my ears, it does sound like a sincere attempt to help her feel better and stronger.\n\nE9. It’s good to see Ja Sung apologize officially to Shi Woo, and explain that he’d been embarrassed because Shi Woo had seen him being beaten by his dad.\n\nNot all kids would apologize in such a mature way – or at all, really – so this earns Ja Sung some extra brownie points with me.\n\nE11. The entire fiasco at school is quite silly, but it does amuse me that so much chaos could ensue just from Ja Sung’s decision to make a big love confession to Shi Ah.\n\nOn that note, I actually wondered whether Hwang In Yeop is an idol, coz the song sounds like it’s in his voice, and it’s a very solid performance. It doesn’t look like he is one, though, so color me impressed; he’s more versatile than I’d thought.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nThe Funny\n\nFor the record, I actually found a lot of funny to enjoy in this show. Sure, some of the jokes fell a little flat for me, like how these two employees of Deok Jin’s keep stumbling on situations involving our characters, and jumping to the wrong conclusions.\n\nBy and large, though, I found that I laughed quite a lot during my watch, which is Quite Something, since k-humor so often doesn’t work that well, for me.\n\nHere are some of the things that tickled my funny bone, over the course of our story.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE4. I’m tickled that teenaged Ae Rin is also played by Lee Mi Do, and I’m even more tickled that Dae Young had been her first (one-sided) love.\n\nThat puts quite the spin on how adult Ae Rin’s been treating adult Dae Young, since she’s appeared to be so repulsed in his presence.\n\nBecause I feel bad for Dae Young, whom she’s been so annoyed and repelled by, it gives me some satisfaction that she’s falling for Dae Young all over again, now that he’s young and handsome again – and it’s still a futile one-sided love.\n\nE4. On the other hand, I am suitably amused that Dae Young’s efforts to take care of his daughter are received by Ji Ho as romantic competition. I can already see Ji Ho’s defense radar go into overdrive, as he observes Dae Young doing things for Shi Ah.\n\nE6. Ae Rin’s crush on Dae Young getting further triggered by him catching her mid-fall (to an iconic song from Secret Garden, while time freezes for her, ha) and him gifting her slippers when hers had broken, is very entertaining.\n\nE8. Muahaha. The random scene with Ae Rin and her clingy ex-boyfriend (cameo by Heo Jeong Min), culminating in a classic Hallyu tropey scene, where Deok Jin saves her by claiming to be her boyfriend. All this, scored by the Lovers in Paris OST too.\n\nHA. It’s so silly, but I find it hilarious.\n\nE9. It’s rather amusing that Ji Ho and Ja Sung are so intent on wooing Shi Ah, and they both see Dae Young as romantic competition, when all Dae Young wants to do, is keep any and all boys away from his baby girl, always, heh.\n\nE12. I was suitably tickled by how jumpy and paranoid Da Jung and Shi Ah become, as they individually obsess over the idea that Woo Young might like them.\n\nHahaha. It’s silly and obviously scripted since mother and daughter behave with such unison, but I am amused anyway.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nSTUFF THAT WAS OK\n\nDeok Jin’s loveline\n\nEssentially, I liked Deok Jin’s loveline more in concept than in execution.\n\nI felt that there was a lot of potential for cuteness, with him falling in love with Teacher Ok (Kim Yoo Ri) at first sight, but being hampered by his identity as Dae Young’s “father.”\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nI was suitably amused at the reveal, that Teacher Ok is actually a gaming nerd, and already acquainted with Deok Jin online.\n\nI was anticipating hijinks and possibly a crush reversal, since Deok Jin is well respected online, but Deok Jin’s attempts to court Teacher Ok are sadly met with dead-ends multiple times.\n\nSometimes, I found Deok Jin and his ardent but repeatedly failed attempts to court Teacher Ok quite funny, but mostly, I was a little disappointed that this arc was angsty where I’d expected it to be fun.\n\nFor the record, I do like Deok Jin’s big declaration to Teacher Ok in episode 11, telling her that she deserves to be true to herself. It’s sweet, and I do really like the final thing he tells her, that all cool people are abnormal.\n\nLove that. I need to remember that one.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nThe office politics\n\nI understand that the office environment is written to be tough on purpose, so that Da Jung has obstacles to face and overcome, but they weren’t my favorite thing to watch, because it involved people making things difficult for Da Jung.\n\nI didn’t like the fact that Director Moon is determined to force Da Jung to leave, and I also didn’t like how Da Jung’s colleague Yu Mi keeps scheming to put Da Jung down either.\n\nStill, it was gratifying to witness Da Jung dealing with everything with grace, poise and compassion, so I can’t complain too much.\n\nSTUFF I DIDN’T LIKE SO MUCH\n\nLee Ki Woo as Il Kwon\n\nWhen Il Kwon is first introduced to us, as Da Jung and Dae Young’s ex-schoolmate, who happens to think of Da Jung as his first love, he seems pleasant and harmless, with some potential for first love hijinks, but oh was I wrong about him.\n\nIl Kwon turns out to be a total manipulative player jerk. Ugh.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nI am grossed out that he and his friends take actual bets on his ability to woo women. I also hate his manipulative behavior with his female targets. I’d thought all this was bad enough, but he’s even worse than I thought.\n\nThe way that he brings Da Jung to the nightclub in episode 7, and expects her not only to bribe him and other basketball coaches to pave the way for Shi Woo’s basketball career, but to also pour drinks for the men as well?\n\nBLECH. It’s demeaning and immoral and just all-around horrible and distasteful. I wanted him to be served his comeuppance so bad.\n\nOn the upside, Il Kwon gets his just desserts in episode 9 and doesn’t come back. I’m grateful for this, since many other dramas tend to bring back their villains, just for the heck of it.\n\nShow makes an attempt to explain Il Kwon’s behavior, implying that he became this way because of the behavior that he’d witnessed from his his ex-coach and his dad. And yes, I’ll buy that that did have an influence on how he turned out.\n\nBut, he needs to bear responsibility for his own decisions too.\n\nNot everyone who’s witnessed bad behavior or suffered insults becomes a jerk who’s intent on meting out to others just as much as he’s received.\n\nAlso on the upside, I’m happy to see how everyone rallies around to help Da Jung – even if some, like Deok Jin, practically have to be coerced AND bribed into it.\n\nStill, I love the warm community feels, from seeing the parents band together to stand up to their Big Bad, and refuse to allow his threats to change their minds.\n\nIt’s a touch drama-cheesy, but I don’t care. And it’s great that Dae Young plays such a key role in helping Da Jung achieve her goal. Deok Jin managing to get Teacher Ok to agree to a cup of coffee with him, is a cute bonus.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nShow’s fake-out habit\n\nIt’s rare that I ever feel this way, but I like this show so much, that I don’t even mind when it toys with me sometimes, with the not-so-occasional fake-out.\n\nTo Show’s credit, the fairly regular fake-outs don’t feel manipulative; instead, they feel like good-natured teasing. And Show fills my heart in so many other ways, that I can’t even be a little bit mad about it.\n\nStill, I concede that Show went a little ham with this at times, and at those times, I did wish that Show could’ve shown some restraint.\n\nHere’s a list of Show’s fake-outs and ribbing, just coz.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT]\n\nE2. The closing scene, where Da Jung seems to conclude that Woo Young is really Dae Young.\n\nE4. Dae Young showing up at the courthouse and identifying himself as Da Jung’s husband.\n\nE5. Show repeatedly teasing us with the cliffhanger from our previous episode.\n\nE5. The stalker spying on Dae Young.\n\nE7. Ae Rin telling Da Jung Dae Young’s secret.\n\nE9. Dae Young apparently back in his older body, at the hospital.\n\n[END SPOILER]\n\nTHEMES / IDEAS\n\nE2. That detail, that teenagers don’t tend to tell their parents anything, rings true for me. I don’t recall telling my parents much when I was a teenager either.\n\nAnd it’s so poignant to see it from Dae Young’s point of view now, as he realizes that his kids haven’t been telling him their truths, all this time.\n\nHis disappointment and wistfulness is so raw, I really feel for him.\n\nE3. What a sobering reminder, of how easily people are influenced by appearances, when we see young Dae Young getting a completely different reaction from Ae Rin compared to adult Dae Young, when he asks to share her umbrella.\n\nWith young Dae Young, Ae Rin’s completely transfixed by his youthful handsomeness, but with adult Dae Young, she’s aggravated by his adjusshi-ness. Sigh. It’s an unfair world.\n\nE4. Shi Ah and Shi Woo telling Da Jung that everything is ok with them even though it’s not, is the consideration that they give to her situation.\n\nIt’s quite poignant to think that these teenagers, who, as a generation, have the reputation of being self-absorbed, are actually stressed about their parents and concerned for their mom.\n\nE5. It’s hard to see that Shi Woo and Shi Ah are in pain too, over the divorce, but I do think it’s a fitting spotlight, since divorce isn’t just a couple thing, it’s a family matter.\n\nI like the detail that Shi Woo is looking out for his sister to make sure she’s ok, and it also warms my heart to see that Dae Young is doing what he can, to be there for his kids, even though they don’t know it.\n\nE6. Umbrellas really are turning out to be a symbol of love and care, in this show. This episode, Da Jung offers her umbrella to Dae Young, saying that she can go without, and Dae Young insists on walking her home with it, before he takes it.\n\nIt’s a simple thing, but it really does communicate how you feel about the other person, or at least, how much you want to protect the other person.\n\nE8. Oftentimes, a change in perspective can help you see things more clearly, or differently, and I feel like this is what’s happening with Dae Young.\n\nBefore, when he’d been in the thick of trying to live as his 38 year old self, he’d been so overwhelmed by the stresses of life, that he’d failed to see his family, and their needs, or even himself, in the midst of it all.\n\nBut now, because he’s in a different position, he’s able to see things more clearly, and understands everything better because of it.\n\nDa Jung is seeing Dae Young differently too, but in a different way.\n\nShe doesn’t know that Woo Young is Dae Young, but as she learns things about Dae Young (like what Il Kwon tells her about Dae Young’s decision to give up the chance to train with the team, because he needed to earn money for Shi Woo’s medical bills), and as Woo Young’s actions remind her of Dae Young, she’s able to see Dae Young in a new light all over again, in his supposed absence.\n\nE12. I really like the symbolism of the half moon this episode, where, just because you can’t see the other half, doesn’t mean it’s not there. It’s perfect to describe Dae Young’s situation.\n\nJust because his family can’t see him right now, doesn’t mean he’s not there.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON EPISODE 14 [SPOILERS]\n\nAugh. The feels. I love how this show brings all of the feels, and never seems to run out. I’m not ready to say goodbye to these characters, though, so I’m really quite sad that I only have 2 episodes left.\n\nI was all ready for Da Jung to be convinced that Woo Young is really Dae Young, with how he shows her that it’s him talking on phone with her, but Da Jung’s denial is strong, heh.\n\nIn a drama world where everyone else who is in on the secret has accepted it without much fuss, Da Jung stands out because she refuses to believe it for almost a whole episode.\n\nOf course, this begs the question why, and I think it comes down to two things.\n\n1, In our opening flashback, we see how differently Dae Young had behaved, in the time leading up to the divorce.\n\nGone were the sweet nothings of yesteryear, to the point that it gets awkward if either of them wants to say, “I miss you.”\n\nOf course Da Jung would find it hard to believe that Woo Young, who’s been sweet, thoughtful and considerate, is the same person that she remembered being married to.\n\n2, I think it’s also partly because Da Jung’s embarrassed about how her heart’s fluttered for a young Woo Young, and she’s mortified by the idea that Dae Young’s possibly aware of it.\n\nI’m glad that Dae Young reacts in a very respectful manner, when Da Jung refuses to believe him.\n\nHe tries to explain himself and he tries to get her to listen, but he never forces the issue, and by the later stretch of the episode, it seems that he’s ready to accept that she just doesn’t believe him, and wants him out of her life, as sad as that makes him.\n\nThat’s so.. gentle, of him. I can’t help but appreciate him, so much, even while my heart aches for him.\n\nI love Dae Young’s arc with Da Jung’s mom this episode. I’m disappointed that Mom’s leaving, because she’s such a grounded, earthy presence, and I always love Kim Mi Kyung on my screen, but her departure arc is so poignant and brings so many feels that I’m almost ok with her going back to Gangneung. Almost.\n\nI love getting a sense of how close Mom and Dae Young had gotten, and I love how she thinks of him as her son, and he, his mother.\n\nThe way he remembers all the little things about her, like her weak wrists, and her favorite snack to have on the bus, and the way she remembers all the little things about him, like the way he eats, how he loves stewed ribs, and how he always tells her to take a taxi from the bus terminal, is so heartwarming.\n\nI love it.\n\nThe wistfulness on both sides is so palpable, as they think about each other, and now I just want these two to be together forever as mother and son. ❤️\n\nAe Rin’s a loyal friend. I kinda love how she stormed out of that class reunion, after putting people in their places for talking smack about Da Jung.\n\nI honestly didn’t expect Shi Ah and Ji Ho to start dating, because Shi Ah hadn’t actually seemed romantically interested in Ji Ho, but I’ll take it; it cute.\n\nAnd I like that Ja Sung demonstrates his loyalty by standing up to protect her – and new boyfriend Ji Ho – against the bullies from the other school. I’m liking Ja Sung more and more; he’s a good kid.\n\nBoo. I’m bummed that Da Jung loses her job because of unfair voting, that’s so wrong. I am mollified that Director Moon is upset about it though, because he’d been the most vocal before, about getting rid of Da Jung.\n\nI’m just confused about why he doesn’t do anything to change things, since he’s aware that the results are a case of unfair voting.\n\nI seriously love how everything comes together in Da Jung’s head, with regard to Woo Young and Dae Young. Writer-nim has clearly planned ahead, planting all these parallel statements and soundbites in scenes featuring older and younger Dae Young, so that it all lines up perfectly. I love it.\n\nIt builds a picture of consistency too, showing us that Dae Young’s heart is in the same place, whether he’s in his older or younger body.\n\nOmona, that kiss at the end basically melted me into a flailing, hyperventilating puddle. There’s so much gentleness and tenderness and sensuality in how Dae Young looks at Da Jung, his gaze never leaving her face, and the way he holds her, cradling her head with his hand, as he kisses her, pulling her closer with every breath.\n\nAugh. Melt. Swoon. Faint.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON THE PENULTIMATE EPISODE [SPOILERS]\n\nWhat a rollercoaster of an episode this was. I feel winded, from feeling too many emotions than my brain is ready to process. I literally need to just sit, and breathe, and feel all of the feelings, before I can figure out what I think of it all. Oof.\n\nI love that Da Jung and Dae Young kiss and make up, and I love how wonderfully emotional their reunion scene is. Even on a second viewing (ok, third, I couldn’t help myself), I feel so affected by the way Dae Young gazes at Da Jung.\n\nThere’s so much unspoken emotion there; guilt, tenderness, regret, uncertainty, growing realization, and it all culminates in him pulling Da Jung to himself, in an embrace that he’s clearly been longing for, all this time that he’s been appearing in front of her as Woo Young. Augh.\n\nAnd then the kisses.. tentative at first, but only growing deeper, more tender and more passionate, as all of the emotion that’s been pent up, finally finds release.\n\nAUGH. The unhurried, tender kisses, so full of longing, hunger and wonder, all wrapped up in sweet familiarity and affection.\n\nThere’s something so unrushed and yet so hungry about this scene, like he literally cannot get close enough to her, or get enough of her, and needs to breathe her in.\n\nMy heart is imploding from the feelss. Puddle.\n\nOmona. He has such beautiful hands.. ❤️❤️\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI love just as much, the healthy conversation that Da Jung and Dae Young have. He apologizes for misunderstanding her and assuming she was having an affair; she doesn’t take it to heart, saying that she’s learned that communication is key even between longtime married couples.\n\nShe tells him that there’s nothing going on between her and Ji Hoon; he apologizes that she’d had to lie to him, because he’d lied to her; she thanks him for taking care of her and their kids, even when they hadn’t known it. It’s all so necessary, beyond the kisses, and I am so glad that they’ve wasted no time in saying what is needful.\n\nDa Jung and Dae Young are so cute, going on dates together, staying up all night while out on said date, and chatting often on the phone. They really strike me as a young campus couple, except that they’re not.\n\nI laughed out loud at Da Jung’s prank on Deok Jin and Ae Rin, where she pretends to have fallen for Woo Young; it’s childish, petty, and the perfect harmless way to get back at Deok Jin and Ae Rin for keeping the truth from her.\n\nI actually really like that Da Jung and Dae Young are literally blind to the fact that he looks a lot younger than her right now, until the people around them start drawing their attention to it, at the sandwich shop.\n\nI’m a little bummed that the assumptions and remarks do end up getting to them, but I appreciate that they need to think of Da Jung’s reputation as a public figure.\n\nIt’s cute that Ji Ho gets all nervous around Dae Young, even before he realizes that Woo Young really is Shi Ah’s dad.\n\nI wasn’t expecting Ji Ho to actually catch on to Dae Young’s identity, but I find it endearing that Ji Ho now starts addressing Dae Young as “ahjusshi” and being all polite and respectful, even though Dae Young still looks all of 18.\n\nIt’s also sweet that even when Ji Ho apologizes for having been rude to Dae Young, Dae Young demurs and says that Ji Ho was never rude to him, and offers to give Ji Ho pocket money for keeping his secret.\n\nThe fatherly energy in this scene is pretty strong, and I really enjoy it.\n\nI can practically feel Dae Young’s desire to return to his older body, it’s so palpable, especially after Ji Ho tells him that Shi Ah’s waiting for him, and even more after Shi Woo calls and asks him to attend his basketball match, and he has to make an excuse and decline.\n\nI can feel his longing for his children intensifying, to the point where being able to take care of them as Woo Young, is no longer enough.\n\nI appreciate the friendly conversation between Ji Hoon and Da Jung.\n\nHe tells her about his troubles with Seo Yeon, (Ugh. Seo Yeon’s mother is awful and cruel, and I hope she lives to regret how she treats her own daughter), and Da Jung gives him some great advice, about allowing Seo Yeon to see him as her uncle rather than her adoptive father.\n\nAlso, PHEW, that all those hints about Dae Young being somehow involved in the accident that killed Ji Hoon’s brother, were misdirects. I just knew that if our good-hearted Dae Young were to have been involved in any way, it would’ve been in the capacity of helping, and not hurting, those involved.\n\nJi Hoon tells Da Jung that if it were to a man lesser than Dae Young, that he wouldn’t concede defeat and give up on pursuing her, and wishes Da Jung and Dae Young a lifetime of happiness.\n\nI appreciate that Ji Hoon is essentially acknowledging Dae Young as an awesome human being, without ever actually seeing him (that he knows of). There’s something very pure about that that I like.\n\nThe flashbacks that we see of how much Da Jung and Dae Young had struggled as young parents, really does bring a tear to my eye. They were so young, and they both suffered so much, and yet worked so hard to be strong for each other; it’s such a touching portrayal of selfless love.\n\nAnd in the context of that, along with that selfless approach to love, I can understand why Da Jung feels it’s better to cut Dae Young loose; she wants to let him pursue the dreams that he gave up, for her and the kids, and she knows that given a choice, he would choose them again, and put himself last.\n\nAt the same time, I feel so bad for Dae Young, who wants nothing more than to be near his wife and kids, but is being told that he’s being cut off, for his own good. His tears say so much; there’s disbelief, consternation, fear, and desperation.\n\nAugh. Lee Do Hyun nails this scene, and I am blown away by all of the raw emotion reaching out of my screen to hit me in the gut. Oof.\n\nThe scene afterwards, where we see Dae Young at the basketball court, doggedly shooting hoops while trying to reverse his wish, is so full of desperation and pathos. Tear.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE ENDING [SPOILERS]\n\nI feel like I’m being a little ungrateful, feeling underwhelmed by Show’s finale, after Show’s served up such a wonderful plethora of feels through the rest of its run, but it’s the bare naked truth: I wanted better and more, from this final episode.\n\nTo be clear, the finale we do get isn’t terrible by any means; there’re lots of solidly good moments. I just thought it could’ve been better.\n\nBefore I get into what I wanted from Show, let’s revisit what Show did serve up.\n\nThis finale runs like an extended epilogue, and we get to see how life goes on, after Dae Young returns to his older body.\n\nDae Young has tearful individual reunions with Da Jung, Shi Woo and Shi Ah, and I thought it was a nice touch, that Dae Young, echoed by Da Jung, would apologize to Shi Woo and Shi Ah for all that they’ve had to go through, and ask permission to live together as a family again.\n\nI really liked this scene, and felt it was all-around respectful, sweet and touching.\n\nYu Mi uploads the video footage of Da Jung singlehandedly taking down Pervert PD, which blows up in a really good way, and Da Jung’s suddenly inundated with work offers.\n\nI thought this was a nice way to give Yu Mi a turnaround, without giving her a whole new personality. I also thought it was sweet that Dae Young volunteered to help Da Jung sort through all the job offers, as her manager.\n\nWith his new resolve to let Seo Yeon treat him as her uncle rather than her father, Ji Hoon successfully leaves his slump behind, and enjoys a fresh happy bond with Seo Yeon.\n\nHe also meets Dae Young face to face for the first time, and they shake hands with mutual respect and gratitude. I liked this too.\n\nDeok Jin finally wins Teacher Ok’s heart, with a little help from his new Iron Man suit, and from young Dae Young, who’d told Teacher Ok that Deok Jin’s not his real dad, before his departure from school.\n\nIn quite the turnaround, Teacher Ok even grabs Deok Jin for a kiss, after his dramatic Iron Man confession. I’m mildly amused by this arc, and I’m just happy for Deok Jin that he finally gets his girl.\n\nTwo year time-skip later, we see that everyone’s happy – except for Spiteful Ex-classmate, who gets left out of the class reunion.\n\nJi Ho and Shi Ah are still dating, and celebrate their 800th day together; Shi Woo has a girlfriend now, whom he assures he will never let go of; Dae Young now coaches kiddie basketball and is really happy about it; Da Jung continues to do well at work.\n\nDae Young asks Da Jung to marry him again, in pretty much the same way he’d once asked Da Jung to date him, by asking her to grant him a wish if he successfully makes a basket, which of course he does.\n\nAe Rin takes Da Jung paragliding as a wedding gift, and we witness the sweet wedding that Dae Young and Da Jung finally have, after having foregone it before, because they couldn’t afford it.\n\nMysterious Grandpa, whose magic had given Dae Young the chance to be young again, shows up at the wedding, and he signals Dae Young to keep the magic a secret.\n\nWe then see Dae Young and Da Jung’s life together after the wedding; not everything’s sweet and rosy, but through the bickering and frustrations of daily life, love and understanding prevail.\n\nAll warm and positive things, to be sure. So, why is it that I feel underwhelmed by this finale? It wasn’t the lack of Lee Do Hyun on my screen, though I assure you, I did feel his absence quite acutely, despite Show’s efforts to sprinkle in his presence through various scenes. 😭💔\n\nLee Do Hyun really embodied so much of this show’s heart and soul. ❤️\n\nEssentially, I feel like Show robbed me of payoff, after all the emotional investment that it’d convinced me to make.\n\nAfter all of the angst that Dae Young experiences leading up to this finale, and his anguish at not being able to get back to his older body, Show makes a decidedly odd choice, to completely gloss over the very thing that Dae Young’s been angsting over.\n\nThe moment Dae Young switches from his younger body to his older one, is when he chooses his family all over again, and this time, without fear of regret.\n\nI appreciate the significance of this, and I also note that Da Jung’s expression as she looks at him, indicates that this change is for real, and isn’t one of those transitions in the past, where the change had been purely for our benefit as viewers.\n\nThe thing is, though, why are we not given a look at how Dae Young reacts to this change that he’s been longing for, for so long? It’s not like Show didn’t have time for it, since this entire finale is basically spent in epilogue-esque fanservice.\n\nWhy couldn’t we have given Dae Young screen time and space to react to this, because surely he would have a lot of feelings about this? I feel cheated by this lack of payoff, after all the tears and anguish of our penultimate episode.\n\nI don’t get it. It really feels like Show spent a whole lot of time, laboriously building up to a punchline – only to forget that it had a punchline.\n\nBecause of this, all of the epilogue-flavored events of this finale tasted a little hollow to me.\n\nWhat’s the use of all the toppings, if you neglect to serve up the meat of the main dish? 😑\n\nAnother thing that I also found a little odd this hour, is Yoon Sang Hyun’s delivery of Dae Young. I don’t know if my eyes are playing tricks on me, but it seems to me that Yoon Sang Hyun’s gaze this entire finale, leans sad and wistful.\n\nI don’t understand this choice? I’d imagine that Dae Young would be more happy than sad, to finally get to be with his family again, but all I’m getting from Yoon Sang Hyun’s eyes, is a sense of mournful wistfulness.\n\nI found this rather distracting, to be honest.\n\nThat said, I feel like I can’t quibble with Show too much, because it had stolen my heart so completely, through its first 15 episodes.\n\nI do genuinely like the note on which we leave our characters.\n\nWe see young Dae Young and Da Jung agree to always walk together, hand in hand, and then we see Dae Young and Da Jung in the present, agreeing to do the same, all over again.\n\nAnd as we hear them in voiceover, we see all our other characters do the same, as if they are becoming direct beneficiaries of Dae Young and Da Jung’s gained wisdom:\n\nDae Young: Thinking back, endless happiness was always in our lives. It’s a common luxury all of us can have. For that happiness, we decided to love our decisions. We chose people based on love, and we are grateful for our decisions. As for my loved ones and myself… I would like to cheer them on to the end of time.\n\nDa Jung: In life, even if you miss out on happiness, as long as you have that one person who will look for happiness with you, your life will be worth living.\n\nDae Young: Don’t forget that you love each other.\n\nDa Jung: Be disappointed that you cannot cherish each other better.\n\nDae Young: And promise for a better tomorrow.\n\nDa Jung: Like that, our lives will continue.\n\nAn inspiring and affirming benediction indeed. 🥰❤️\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT:\n\nHeartfelt, moving and so full of feels. ❤️\n\nFINAL GRADE: A\n\nTEASER:\n\nMV:\n\n#### WHERE TO WATCH:\n\nYou can check out this show on iQIYI here.\n\n#### GETTING AROUND GEO-RESTRICTIONS\n\nIf you’re geo-restricted, a VPN service would help you get around that.

I’m currently on Episode 4 right now, and I am SO disgusted. I’m trying so hard to like this show for its funny moments and heartfelt morals, but the AGE GAP!!! THE AGE GAP!!! It’s honestly disgusting. The fact that the actors had to kiss and create chemistry between them just grosses me out. And honestly, I find it hard to believe that the male lead could’ve aged THAT badly.\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 months ago\n\nReply to\n\nAlso, the entire show is centered around how the teen pregnancy ruined their (Dae-young and Da Jung) lives, and how Dae-young’s magical age-reversing moment gave him a chance to relive his broken dreams. As the saying goes; “Support pregnant teens, not teen pregnancy”. Kind of wish they could’ve just dated, not done anything more…\n\nLast edited 2 months ago by haos\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSu San\n\n1 year ago\n\nApril 2023 just finished.  After 125 dramas under my belt since 2021 gateway CLOY, I still love to read KFG’s review after my watch–I’m addicted to her reviews.  I like to post comments so that newbies like me can see that watching dramas that have been around are definitely worth watching.\n\nLately, I’ve had trouble finding a drama that I can stick with, so I caved in and watched this on DramaCool and DailyMotion since VIKI has yet to license it for the USA subscribers.  (Fingers crossed that no viruses climbed into my pc.) It has been at the top of my watch list for a long time.\n\nLoved “the feels” in this one and the actors–Yoon Sang-Hyun was great as usual and Lee Do-Hyun was fantastic. Overall, this light and heart-warming drama is well-done; don’t miss it, and it reminded me of The Go Back Couple.  Even the filler side stories were ok, but the heart of it is the relationship between a Dad and his kids.  I especially liked the scenes when Dae-Young met with his parents and in-laws and expressed his gratitude, which made me tear up.  “Happiness is a luxury that we can all have…”\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRP\n\n2 years ago\n\nthank you so much for the in depth review. I absolutely loved watching this online.  Not available on Netflix USA yet, but i felt many of the feels and emotions as you did.  Even though this is a drama, i felt there were many lessons learned regarding life and relationships you could take away and perhaps do some refection in ones own life.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKaiaRaia\n\n2 years ago\n\nAs always, your reviews are a great way to re-live dramas. One of my top heartwarming dramas worthy of a rewatch. So spot on about LDH acting chops. Hotel del Luna put him on my radar too.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBrittany\n\n3 years ago\n\nThank you for reviewing this drama!

It was beautiful.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3 years ago\n\nReply to\n\nAh, I’m so pleased that you gave this one a try and loved it, Brittany!! It really is so lovely, in so many ways. 😍❤️\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmandi Jayawardena\n\n3 years ago\n\nI really appreciate your review of this drama, and I’m pretty sure this was my favourite drama from 2020 (along with it’s okay not to be okay and world of the married). And while the other two grabbed me because of their storylines, 18 again had me hooked because of how personal the story is. It definitely made me rethink the way I perceive my own  – especially since I’m turning 18 this year. Especially my relationship with my parents. Either way, I think I’ve properly fallen for Lee Dohyun after his performance in this drama – and I’m really looking forward to the projects he does in the future (along with Hwang In Yeop)\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKdrama addict\n\n3 years ago\n\nAt first I was hesitant to watch this drama since I watched the original movie and  dont really like remakes. I was also doubtful if the main leads will have a good chemistry or it will be awkward to watch them. But boy I was glad that I changed my mind because of all the very good reviews.\n\nThis drama is really heartfelt, i was already teary eyed when I was just in ep 1. I really agree with you that there are other shows that it will take time before you appreciate it but this is not one of them.\n\nLee Do Hyun was my favorite male character in Hotel de Luna and he is really good in here too. When I’m watching, i was convinced that he is in his late 30s,a husband and father of 2 kids. He really deserved to be nominated in Baeksang Arts awards and I really hope that he’ll win it.\n\nI’m not really a fan of Kim Ha Neul but I do like her character. She has been through a lot even at such a young age but she never gave up. She’s still standing strong, never getting tired of fighting for herself and all of the things she believes in.\n\nI also like Wi Ha Joon both here and in Romance is a Bonus Book. I was rooting for his happiness until the very end. I wish he will have a lot more opportunities to show his talent.\n\nI also agree with you with the ending, i wished they could have just shorten the epilogue and added a few more scene with Lee Do Hyun. I really do missed him on the last episide.\n\nOverall, this is really a good watch. I’ll be sleeping with a happy heart and swollen eyes. Thank you for a great recommendation.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatalia\n\n3 years ago\n\nI wouldn’t have watched this show if it hadn’t been for this review – or rather, your recommendation, I read the review after watching the show to avoid spoilers. Thank you for the recommendation, it was a really good show. Besides Lee Do Hyun who was indeed marvelous in this, I enjoyed a lot the entire young cast, especially the twins, not just ShiAh but also Shi Woo. Very good acting by both, but also of all the younger cast. Not that the adult cast wasn’t good, mind you. It’s just that all the kids were so fresh, so endearing. I’ll be looking forward to their next work.\n\nMay I add that I share your feelings about the ending, too. Although it was pretty obvious in the last episodes that Dae Young wished nothing else but to get his old life back, I did get the feeling in the last episode that he was once again somewhat wronged. Yoon Sang Hyun’s delivery had a lot to do that, I think. He does wistful pretty well, but although I have a soft spot for him, I thing Lee Do Hyun completely outshone him in this show.\n\nOne last remark: as a cosplayer, I totally enjoyed Deok Jin’s antics – and I loved his outfits!\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrientedstar\n\n4 years ago\n\nHi fangirl. I’m an avid reader of your blog for some time. After finishing a drama I always check your site for the review and read it. I love your long reviews. Our opinions of the dramas are not always same. They were many dramas which you dropped or did’nt like much but I loved them and vice versa. But for shows I feel the exact same way as you and that happened with this drama. I also enjoyed lee do hyun in Del luna and kept an eye on him and I bacame a fan with this drama. You described to a tee on how I felt about him. Athletic agile and so responsible and so reassured. He just felt so solid. And such a man holding tiny babies and kids in his hands. Swoon flail melt. My ovaries exploded at the parent child running scene in ep 14 epilogue I think which Ji ho watches and Lee do hyun smiling at his daughter in his arms. Auughh so hot!! And da jung was really goals for me. Such a good drama. I loved it.\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatalia\n\n4 years ago\n\nYou can’t stream it in dr@m@c**l in the US?

I’ve been hearing so many good things about it. It’s on my watch list. The only thing holding me back is preferring to watch shows on my TV and that requiring several hoops to jump through to make that happen with this one. I know, I’m greedy when it comes to my drama watching 😂\n\n0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4 years ago\n\nReply to\n\n😆😆 I’m slightly stunned at your strict requirements for your drama watching, Kay!

This show made my heart so, so full, and I happily drowned in all of the feels.</p>\n            <p>Our cast is very strong, but I do sincerely think that this would’ve been a different show without <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor>. He delivers such a heartfelt performance, with such a distinct sense of gravitas, that I am completely blown away.</p>\n            <p>The heart-eyes that I’ve grown for <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> are completely involuntary, and likely permanent. 😍</p>\n            <p>Unreservedly recommend.</p>\n        </Content>\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>THE LONG VERDICT</Title>\n        <Content>\n            <p>They say that what you do is less important than how you do it, and that is so true, of this show.</p>\n            <p>When it comes down to it, there really isn’t anything particularly groundbreaking about our story (it’s an adaptation, after all), and yet, it honestly doesn’t matter, because everything is so heartfelt that Show has me by the heart anyway. I guess what’s surprising, is just how much I like this show.</p>\n            <p>The other thing that’s surprising, is how quickly I started to like this one. As early as episode 1, I already felt engaged and invested. That’s no small deal, since most dramas need a few episodes to get settled, and into a groove.</p>\n            <p>I think one of show’s strengths, is how relatable it is. I’m guessing that many of us have regrets in life, and wonder what we would do differently, if we had the chance (I know I do). And here, Dae Young has that chance.</p>\n            <p>We don’t understand the magic of it, exactly, but it’s so easy to be invested in Dae Young’s second go-around in high school, because in a tangential sort of way, it feels like a vicarious second chance for us too.</p>\n            <p>To my eyes, Show’s true magic is how it has a way of making me laugh, and making me cry, and making my heart swell to the point of bursting, in the best way possible. And, it has a rather extraordinary way of making heartache feel sweet, in the midst of the poignance, too. So.

The song that really got under my skin, though, is Track 2, Hello.</p>\n            <p>Somehow, that grabbed my heart in a big way. To my ears, it felt like the cry of Dae Young’s heart, as he stands before his beloved Da Jung, but can’t tell her who he is.</p>\n            <p>I imagine him wanting so much, to say to her, as himself, “Hello, I’m here.” 💔😭</p>\n        </Content>\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>LENS & EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT</Title>\n        <Content>\n            <p>I feel that there are two main things to keep in mind, while adjusting your viewing lens for this show.</p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>Show’s tone is a touch farcical. This means that sometimes, things can get a little surreal and ridiculous.</li>\n                <li>Certain common sense rules don’t apply. What I mean is, as various characters come to know Dae Young’s secret, they tend to accept it without a lot of fuss, whereas in a normal world, this would be a really bizarre thing that would require a lot more convincing.</li>\n            </ol>\n            <p>This is a bit weird, to be sure, but while I do wish this was treated with a bit more realism, this is, after all, a fantasy story, and if glossing over characters’ reactions to Dae Young being 18 again gives us more screen time for heartwarming things, I can absolutely live with that.</p>\n        </Content>\n    </Section>\n    \n    <Section>\n        <Title>STUFF I LIKED</Title>\n        <Content>\n            <p>For the record, I liked a lot of things about this show, so much so that I find it impossible to talk about them all. There are some characters that I liked, like Shi Woo, who don’t get their own section in this category.</p>\n            <p>That doesn’t mean I don’t like them; I just need to draw the line somewhere. 😅</p>\n            <p><Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> as Dae Young. This is the drama that I didn’t know I wanted, for <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor>. Boy is SO GOOD in this.</p>\n            <p>I mean, I’d been impressed with him in Hotel Del Luna, but I’d kept in mind that he only debuted in 2017, and so might need more time to gain more acting experience and work his way up to a meaty lead role.</p>\n            <p>But here he is, blowing my socks off, from beginning to end, with acting skill and range that I didn’t know he had. 🤩</p>\n            <p>To be honest, when I’d first seen the casting news of this show, I’d had doubts, because in my head, <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> is nothing like Yoon Sang Hyun. And yet, <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> channels Yoon Sang Hyun’s interpretation of Dae Young is every way.</p>\n            <p>From the way he walks, to the cadence of his speech, to the tone of his voice, to the slightly wild, slightly shifty look in his eyes, to his body language, he just morphs into Dae Young for me. I am so impressed.</p>\n            <p>I just love-love-love <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> as newly young Dae Young. He’s fantastic at channeling adult Dae Young, and I can totally believe that it’s Yoon Sang Hyun in his body, controlling his body language and speech patterns.</p>\n            <p>Also, there is a difference between young Dae Young, and go-around-for-a-second-youth Dae Young. Newly young Dae Young feels like an adult at heart, whereas original young Dae Young feels like a teenager.</p>\n            <p>That’s really well done, and even though I’ve seen <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> do very nicely in Hotel Del Luna, I’m still blown away.</p>\n            <p>As a shallow fangirl aside, can I just say how GOOD <Actor>Lee Do Hyun</Actor> looks? He looks so strong and athletic, not in a “I pumped iron at the gym” way, but in a way that demonstrates strength, functionality and agility. I can’t help but spazz, at least a little bit.

He is a clear contrast to our protagonsit- the cool headed, titualr Vincenzo.\n\nWhen I watched Vincenzo*, I have considered Han-Seok to be... Well, the worst part about it. Vincenzo has brilliant cast- both in writing and actors, and the yelling-laughing-frankly ANNOYING main antagonist stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\n(*Actually stopped watching circa ep 17,but I have watched and enjoyed most of it. I state it here cause what I write is releveant to the BULK of the show, and even if there was any difference in the last few episodes I don't think it could override my current feelings)\n\nThen I thought about the character, and I've realised I actually find this character brilliant- I just hate the messy execution of an almost subversive idea.l\n\nAllow me to explain what I mean. Here are the things that I really like about Han-Seok:\n\n- For the beggining of the show, Han-Seok hides himself in plain sight as the bumbling and adorable assistent of Hong Cha-Young, the FL. Only later we discover that he is infact the head of Babel. I LOVE characters that go undercover with a false personality. I love the POTENTIAL of it-weather it be comedic (his convestation with the big shots in Wusang that later totally changed in tone and power dynamics) or dramatic (the feelings of Cha-Young post revelation), or stratigic (the way he can spy on the leads and hide in plain sight).\n- Btw his relationship with the FL, it was very clear that he was crushing on her, hard. He kept fussing around her like a puppy, often caring for her (remembering where she parked her car, or giving her snacks). However, the feeling were NOT mutual, and even though Cha-Young handled him well, it did seem to annoy her. A LOT of his actions feel pushy, controlling, or at best inapropriate and unwanted. This running gag acts as amazing forshadowing to his real nature, but it's more than that; a lot of his more questionable actions can be excuse as the doing of a lovesick KDrama character. Putting it in prespective, saying outright that this is controlling and wrong, could have served as a critique of the type of character often used as the ML- rich guy who's \"acts of love\" are actually just controlling and bondary-crossing.\n- I mentioned it before, but he is an excellent foil to Vincenzo. The entire idea is bad vs evil- Vinny is no saint, but he isn't evil incarnate the way Han-Seok is (or at least, that is the way the show depictes the Itallian mob). If Vincenzo is cool and level headed, than Han-Seok is a chaotic storm trying to capture the magical essence of that effortless chic.\n- Vincenzo, as a show, does INCREADIBLE work with group dynamic. There are so many sub group that are a JOY to watch come together or work apart, and even though the leads are still the leads, they never overshadow the (DELIGHTFUL) supporting character and all show great chemistry. This goes to the villan group, as well. I like that each one is their own type of villan, and how they work under the order of the most combastic leadership possible.\n- Being hyped as a CEO by the public while we know how aweful he is hit very close to home with all that ceo-worshipping going around.\n- The entire relationship he had with his brother, the ever suffering Han-Seo. Just... an endless well of conflict, drama, and a way to add extra depth to the both of them. It also plays back to the theme of family heavily used in the series. Making them brothers was just.... *a Chef's Kiss*\n\nConsidering all the above, Han-Seok sounds like a hit-and-run (or whatever the hockey equivellent is). So why did I hate him so much? Well, there were layers to this point of view as well.\n\nPart of it was the good ol' \"I'm not mad, just dissapointed\". Some of the points mentioned above were explored in the show- for example, the villan group dynamic, where each is an antagonist of a different kind and all have to work together and NONE (but Han-Seok) actually enjoying it. However, this character failed on some of its most exciting (to me!) aspects:\n\n- I still don't get WHY did he go undercover. I understand that he did it for the funzies, but it was never clear to me what it was that he enjoyed about it, and what part of it is was him being true to himself, and what part a lie.  The best thing about exploring aliases and alter-egos is the way it is influenced - and is influencing- the \"real\" self.\n- the relationship with Cha-Young was left unexplored- the loving puppy act was dropped entirely the MOMENT she became aware of his true nature. Not dropped by the character, but by the narrative; anything about those feelings, how they might menfiest in post haircut Han-Seok and how they would make Cha-Young feel was gone- and with that, the entirety of the critcque of romantic tropes.\n- I enjoyed the strained brotherly relationship emmensly, but I think I wished the show would have dived more into it on Han-Seok's end. It ended up just being \"yeah I'll be cruel to you in any way the plot will require me too\" (Poor Han SEO!). It was actually mentioned that the younger brother had to undergo therapy because of the abuse of the older, but it did not go further.\n\nWith that being said, the thing that turned Han-Seok from not-entirely-up-to-potential to the absaloute bane of my watching exprience was, well, his personality.\n\nI think the show wanted Han-Seok to be a calculating mastermind, a greedy upper-class business man,  an unstable killer and just an a**hole who takes joy in acts of crulety all at once. I found myself thinking- 'does he want money, or does he want to be destructive for the fun of it?\";  at some point they even gave him serial killer quircks for the hell of it. Like, PICK A LANE, BRO.\n\nThis, along with the over the top screaming-laughing combo, felt more like a Joker Cosplayer being very method actor about his convention exprience than a captivating antagonist. I found him silly, childish, and worse of all-whatever the plot needed him to be at the moment.  Him becoming a Vincenzo wannabe did not help. I always felt like the show tried to oversell this guy as some sort of a mastermind, but only sometimes, when he was not a loose cannon. It was a WHOLE mess and I swear to god I could do with less than half the laughing-when-nothing-is-funny and NONE of the yelling. The last arguemnt might be a personal bias, as I despise yelly and laughing-at-nothing villans (I will entertain only one of those attributes).  I just wanted him to shut up.\n\nI think I would've enjoyed him much better had he kept the same fluffy-puppy energy he presented at the start of the show. Just being pleasent, bubbly, seemingly clunmsy and non-threatning while, well, pummling people to death with his hockey stick. To me, Han-Seok is a person that never had to account to anything- being a conventionally attractive man with too much money and power. Being \"sweet\" would have been a good continuation of that, of making us confront what we find acceptable and desirable, attributes that make us tolorate the worse behaviours. I think the hype he had as a \"young and hot\" ceo was a good implentation of this. I just wish he had the consistency to back it up. Also, as a side note, I think the actor was much more in his zone playing the fluffy assistent. And we could still have a cold, calculative mastermind, who takes joy in being cruel and knows he can get away with it because society put him on a padastal. Someone the audience might even find charming, for moments, followed by being unsettling at such feelings at this horrible person in the first place.\n\nAll in all, as the title said, mixed feelings.

A hymn to humanity and an ode to human vices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n26 October, 2022 8 min read\n\n- Directing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToday we want to talk about a bloody philosopher and ruthless humanist — a psychologist who studied not so much the causes of negative emotions as their harmful effects; a visionary who transformed acts of monstrous violence into beautiful paintings, and even in the darkest darkness, can find hope. And one of the most high-profile and, at the same time, unpopular Korean directors of our time. Meet Park Chang-wook. We look at some of his films, which reflect the director's path.\n\n## A Brief Biography\n\nHis story begins without any frills. Park dreamt of becoming an art critic in high school and then tried to enter Seoul University to study aesthetics but ended up at a Catholic University where he studied philosophy. As a student, he experienced a cinematic shock when he saw Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" (1958), forever chaining the young beauty lover to the world of cinema.\n\n## \"The Moon Is... The Sun's Dream\", 1992.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPark began saving for his debut work by moonlighting in the film industry: helping with commercials, translating foreign films, and working as an on-set assistant. Then, after a quiet rental of his first picture, the director went into creative contemplation for five years. These failures led to Park Chang-wook not making a full-fledged name for himself in big cinema until nearly a decade later.\n\n\"The Moon Is... The Sun's Dream\" is an extraordinary work, utterly different in style and maximally distant in its contents from the usual Park Chang-wook's. Instead, it's more influenced by Hong Kong films, especially Wong Kar Wai's \"As Tears Go By\" 1988.\n\nThe plot is reminiscent of melodramas, although it is a classic crime drama. In his first work, Park Chang-wook shows an interest in the themes of violence and justice, showing a cross-section of the criminal lives of several people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe young director managed to make a drama about life's priorities, love tossing, and a sense of duty. An essential sign of Park's immaturity is the characters: \"The Moon Is... The Sun's Dream\" prefers to tread on the surface, catching the poetry in details and mundane minutiae.\n\nThis movie is entirely different, not fully formed, and perhaps not fully understood by the director himself; where there are many subtle aspects and nuances of life, but none of them strive for vivid emotion and proper development.\n\n## \"Joint Security Area,\" 2000.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is Park Chang-wook's first preeminent and relatively high-profile work on a global scale. The new scale is primarily reflected in the subject matter the young director chooses to focus on.\n\nThe film reveals the tragic conflict between North and South Korea, telling a controversial story. We won't go into the retelling of the story. Still, Park Chang-wook was not afraid to show the cynical side of military institutions and that everyone uses propaganda and manipulation no matter what side. For example, the protagonist is the primary witness to the crime and the suspect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo find out who is guilty of this crime, investigators from Sweden and Switzerland arrive at the demilitarized zone, located on the border of the two warring countries, to investigate the situation.\n\nThe narrative gradually departs from the usual detective genre of investigation and moves freely to show everyday scenes of friendly relations between the military of South and North Korea. In addition, the film has a non-linear narrative, so the action takes place several months before the tragic incident. As a result, there is less emphasis on politics, manipulation, and hatred and more on how strangers reunite and see each other as brothers rather than as imposed monsters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis movie is not about truth and not about finding someone to blame. The culprits are known to us from the beginning, even if they are not shown in the frame, and the so-called \"victims\" of the confrontation are just people deceived by the system who are lucky enough to finally talk to each other for the first time, putting down their guns. This sweet gesture contains the moral of the film. The main sign of humanity is the ability to listen, to understand the other person, and then, perhaps, to accept.\n\n\"Joint Security Area\" is a revealing anti-war film where war is not just an armed clash of interests but also an ideologically imposed, ungrounded hatred of one's fellow man. In the best traditions of the genre, the love for human life and a sincere desire to live up to the day when the invisible walls will finally fall, regardless of what is broadcast over the loudspeakers.\n\n## \"Oldboy,\" 2003.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe phenomenon of an angry man in a black suit with messy hair and a hammer in his hands has long since left the confines of cinema, becoming a kind of personification of human despair and thirst for revenge.\n\nPark Chan-wook's creation, an adaptation of the manga of the same name, made a huge splash in its day and majestically reminded the world of South Korean cinema. That same year another equally outstanding film, \"Memories of Murder\" by Bong Joon ho, was also released (you may be interested in reading ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHowever, \"Oldboy\" is famous first and foremost for its bold naturalism, unconcealed symbolism, and double-edged story, which is deceptive right up to the finale. The protagonist is presented to us as a harmless drunken father who, despite his addiction, loves and cares deeply for his daughter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe hero is kidnapped and imprisoned for fifteen years: the location, the reason, and the client's name are unclear; there is only the bewildering fact and unknown length of confinement. And then the first plot revelation occurs. \"Oldboy\" poses the hero with an important question: which is more important, revenge or truth? Dae-su Oh (the protagonist) has the opportunity to take revenge on his abuser almost at the beginning of the second act of the story, but he backs away and begins a brutal investigation into his imprisonment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\"Oldboy\" is a story about anger and resentment that doesn't go away but accumulates inside, eating away at your gut. A more beautiful, subtle, and majestic story about a lowly subject cannot be invented. It is a tremendous audio-visual symphony, speaking frankly on intimate topics without judging the participants for excessive madness and obsession. It reveals a dystopian situation in which feelings take control of the mind and animal instincts, wreaking havoc and carnage.\n\n### Violence as Revelation\n\nDon't look for hints of rationality and sound justice in \"Oldboy\" because instead, you'll find only hypertrophied logic and blatant overkill that some may find inappropriate. However, with this picture, Park Chan-wook proved that he is interested in the subtle psychological processes that lead to hatred, the strongest, most sincere, and pure feeling in Korean genius filmmaking.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough hatred, Park Chan-wook reflects on pain and trauma. And his films are devoid of hope; the characters in his movies surrender to hate and revenge in order to forget. In \"Oldboy\" the director does not essentially look for the guilty - he craves only reprisals. Every act leads to bloodshed and moral torture, making the movie feel like a highly personal, almost intimate picture that doesn't know how to compromise or simplify conflict for the benefit of the mass audience.\n\nAt this pace, Park spent the next few years creating an excellent revenge trilogy that also included \"Three... Extremes\" (2004), and \"Lady Vengeance\" (2005), where the director dissects the theme of revenge in various forms.\n\n## \"I'm a Cyborg,\" 2006\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAny director could envy Park Chan-wook's versatility because, despite the theme of obsession that haunted him throughout his career, he always manages to create unique and distinctive works.\n\nAfter six years of researching the topic of hatred and its various manifestations, Park decided to take a break and move away from the issue of revenge towards the no less exciting crisis of identity. As a setting, the director changed the aggressive streets to the frightening wards of an asylum. The protagonist, in the form of the oddball girl Yen-gun, considers herself a cyborg and acts accordingly, rejecting human food and interacting with humans like other robots.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith an exotic theme, Park Chan-wook manages to raise the theme of accepting one's inner self in a non-trivial way. The mental hospital allows for portraying extravagant and unusual characters, turning the film into an absurd and even satirical drama. In this way, the director explores an organism devoid of social connections and criticizes the healthcare institution. And it is not about curing incurable diseases but about the fact that people with disabilities are simply cut off from the rest of society and placed in a vacuum, where it should be good. Still, in reality, they are plunged into isolation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost of the characters in the film seem destined to wander down corridors, swallow pills, and see the same faces. No purpose, no hope - everything is on a strict schedule. Park Chan-wook proved that his artistic techniques are not limited to physical violence but can portray violence in verbal and mental ways.\n\n## \"The Handmaiden,\" 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBefore \"The Handmaiden,\" the director spent the decade experimenting with the form, creating \"Thirst\" (2009), revealing the theme of faith, and \"Stoker\" (2013), his Hollywood debut. Nevertheless, the period after his debut overseas is interesting for us, as the 2016 film reveals new facets of Park Chan-wook's directorial talent.\n\nThe theater of action in \"The Handmaiden\" becomes the estate of Japanese aristocrats. The director was interested in exploring the family structure of one particular house, where erotic cult, family despotism, and intricate intrigue can be found.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cornerstone of the artistic design of the film is a new theme of eroticism and the passions going on inside. It reveals a surprising contrast between aesthetics and soulless lust. The power of love and passion pushes every character to act, lie, and build intrigues so that, in the end, they emerge victorious and on the arm of someone who has reciprocal feelings.\n\n\"The Handmaid\" is a significant picture in Park Chan-wook's filmography, because the director found the strength somewhere deep in his heart to finally let the characters go free. The story told looks childish and innocent by the standards of the author, who never kept away from blood, murders, and other cruelties, and now he had dared to tell a beautiful and optimistic story about two innocent, loving hearts running away from the dirt, intrigues, and morally decaying society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Afterword\n\nPark Chan-wook is a virtuoso director, an exquisite visionary, and a radically courageous philosopher who is neither afraid nor ashamed of anything. With cinematography, he repeatedly turns decent people into animals. He exalts them by admiring the human race's beauty and, simultaneously, the spectacle — the dualism of our nature in all its glory. Park is a brilliant author. There is no other word I can think of. A man who has dug deep into the depths of human consciousness as anyone else and pulled out the ugly, frightening, and repulsive images, reflections of the true us that languish deep in the darkness, waiting for the civilized part to let loose and unleash its inner demons.\n\n#### From Breakdown to Budget in Clicks\n\nSave time, cut costs, and let Filmustage’s AI handle the heavy lifting — all in a single day.\n\n#### About author\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVideo enthusiast, camera wizard, and director with invaluable firsthand experience in the film industry.

Park dreamt of becoming an art critic in high school and then tried to enter Seoul University to study aesthetics but ended up at a Catholic University where he studied philosophy.

Then, after a quiet rental of his first picture, the director went into creative contemplation for five years. These failures led to Park Chang-wook not making a full-fledged name for himself in big cinema until nearly a decade later.\n        </paragraph>\n        <paragraph>\n            The plot is reminiscent of melodramas, although it is a classic crime drama.

The recipient of three Academy Awards, his work is characterized by emphasis on social and class themes, genre-mixing, dark comedy, and sudden tone shifts.[1]\n\nBong first became known to audiences and gained a cult following with his feature directorial debut, the black comedy film Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000). He later achieved widespread critical success with his subsequent films: the crime thriller Memories of Murder (2003), the monster film The Host (2006), the science fiction action film Snowpiercer (2013), which served as Bong's English-language debut, and the black comedy thriller Parasite (2019). The latter three are also among the highest-grossing films in South Korea, with Parasite being the highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[2]\n\nAll of Bong's films have been South Korean productions, although Snowpiercer, Okja (2017) and Mickey 17 (2025) are Hollywood co-productions with major use of the English language. Two of his films have screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival—Okja in 2017 and Parasite in 2019; the latter earned the Palme d'Or, which was a first for a South Korean film.[3][4] Bong won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, making Parasite the first non-English language film to win Best Picture.[5][6]\n\nIn 2017, Bong was included on Metacritic's list of the 25 best film directors of the 21st century.[7] In 2020, Bong was included in Time's annual list of 100 Most Influential People[8] and Bloomberg 50.[9]\n\n## Early life\n\nBong was born on September 14, 1969, in Bongheok-dong [ko], Daegu, South Korea.[10] He has three older siblings.[11] His mother, Park So-young, was a housewife; his father, Bong Sang-gyun [ko], was a graphic designer, industrial designer, professor of art at Yeungnam University, and head of the art department at the National Film Institute.[11][12] His father retired from Seoul Institute of Technology as a professor of design in 2007 and died in 2017. Bong's maternal grandfather, Park Taewon, was an esteemed author during the Japanese colonial period, best known for his work A Day in the Life of Kubo the Novelist and his defection to North Korea in 1950.[11][13] His older brother, Bong Joon-soo, is an English professor at the Seoul National University; his older sister, Bong Ji-hee, teaches fashion styling at Anyang University.[12] Bong was raised as a Catholic, and his Christian name is Michael.[14]\n\nWhile Bong was in elementary school, the family relocated to Seoul, taking up residence in Jamsil-dong by the Han River.[13] He later attended Jamsil High School,[15] and lived in an apartment near the Jamsil Bridge at that time. One day, while at the apartment preparing for his college entrance exam during his third year at the high school (in 1987), Bong was reportedly startled by seeing out the window what he beileved to be a monster crawling up a pillar of the Jamsil Bridge and then falling into the Han River. He was already desiring to become a film director at that point in time, and vowed to make a movie about a large creature living around the river someday. 19 years later, he fulfilled his dream when his monster movie The Host (2006) was released.[16]\n\nIn 1988, Bong enrolled in Yonsei University, majoring in sociology.[11] He also studied the English language while in college, and he credits Spike Lee's films with teaching him English profanity.[17] College campuses such as Yonsei's were then hotbeds for the South Korean democracy movement; Bong was an active participant of student demonstrations, frequently subjected to tear gas early in his college years.[11][18] He served a two-year term in the military in accordance with South Korea's compulsory military service before returning to college in 1992.[11] Bong later co-founded a film club named \"Yellow Door\" with students from neighboring universities.[11] As a member of the club, Bong made his first films, including a stop motion short titled Looking for Paradise and 16 mm film short titled Baeksaekin (White Man).[11] He graduated from Yonsei University in 1995.[11]\n\n## Career\n\n### 1994–2005: Early work and feature debut\n\nAfter graduating from university, Bong enrolled in the two-year program at the Korean Academy of Film Arts. While there, he made many 16 mm short films. His graduation films, Incoherence and Memories in My Frame, were invited to screen at the Hong Kong International Film Festival and Vancouver International Film Festival. Bong also collaborated on several works with his classmates, which included working as cinematographer on the highly acclaimed short 2001 Imagine (1994), directed by his friend Jang Joon-hwan. Aside from cinematography, Bong was also a lighting technician on two shorts—The Love of a Grape Seed and Sounds From Heaven and Earth—in 1994.[1] He was credited as a screenwriter on the anthology film Seven Reasons Why Beer is Better Than a Lover (1996); both screenplay and assistant director credits on Park Ki-yong's debut Motel Cactus (1997); and is one of four writers (along with Jang Joon-hwan) credited for the screenplay of Phantom: The Submarine (1999).[1]\n\nIn 1999, Bong began shooting his first feature Barking Dogs Never Bite (released in 2000) under producer Cha Seung-jae, who had overseen the production of both Motel Cactus and Phantom: The Submarine.[19] The film, about a low-ranking university lecturer who abducts a neighbor's dog, was shot in the same apartment complex where Bong lived after his marriage.[20] At the time of its release in February 2000, it received little commercial interest but some positive critical reviews. It was invited to the competition section of Spain's San Sebastián International Film Festival, and won awards at the Slamdance Film Festival and Hong Kong International Film Festival. Slowly building international word of mouth also helped the film financially; over two years after its local release, the film reached its financial break-even point due to sales to overseas territories.[1][additional citation(s) needed]\n\nBong's second film, Memories of Murder (2003), a much larger project, was adapted from a stage play centered on a real-life serial killer who terrorized a rural town in the 1980s.[21] Production of the film was a difficult process (the film set a local record for the number of locations it used).[citation needed] It was released in April 2003 and proved a critical and popular success. Word of mouth drove the film to sell over five million tickets (rescuing Cha Seung-jae's production company Sidus from near-bankruptcy), and a string of local honors followed, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Song Kang-Ho) and Best Lighting prizes at the Grand Bell Awards in 2003. Although passed over by the Cannes Film Festival and Venice Film Festival, the film eventually received its international premiere, again at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, where it picked up three awards including Best Director. The film also received an unusually strong critical reception on its release in foreign territories, such as France and the U.S.[1]\n\nFollowing this, Bong took some time to contribute short films to two anthology film projects. Influenza (2004) is a 30-minute work acted out entirely in front of real CCTV cameras stationed throughout Seoul. The film, which charts a desperate man's turn to violent crime over the space of five years, was commissioned by the Jeonju International Film Festival, together with works by Japanese director Sogo Ishii and Hong Kong-based Yu Lik-wai. Twentidentity, meanwhile, is a 20-part anthology film made by alumni of the Korean Academy of Film Arts, on the occasion of the school's 20th anniversary. Bong's contribution is Sink &amp; Rise (2003), a work set alongside the Han River.[1]\n\n### 2006–2012: International success\n\nBong at a Q&amp;A session for The Host in September 2006.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Host (2006) marked a step up in scale in Bong's career, and for the Korean film industry as a whole.[22] The big-budget ($11 million) work centered on a fictional monster that rises up out of the Han River to wreak havoc on the people of Seoul—and on one family in particular. Featuring many of the actors who had appeared in his previous films, the film was the focus of strong audience interest even before it started shooting, but there were many doubts raised about whether a Korean production could rise to the challenge of creating a full-fledged, believable digital monster.[22] After initially contacting New Zealand's Weta Digital—the company responsible for the CGI in The Lord of the Rings—scheduling conflicts led Bong to San Francisco-based The Orphanage, who took on the majority of the effects work. After rushing to meet deadlines, the film received a rapturous premiere in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Although local audiences were slightly more critical of The Host than attendees at Cannes, the film was nonetheless a major summer hit. With theater owners calling for more and more prints, the film enjoyed South Korea's widest release ever (on over a third of the nation's 1,800 screens) and set a new box office record with 13 million tickets sold. The Host was bought by US studio Universal for the remake rights.[1][23] The administrations of Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye later deemed The Host promoted leftist viewpoints, and included Bong on a leftist blacklist.[24]\n\nBong, along with French film directors Michel Gondry and Leos Carax, directed a segment of Tokyo! (2008), a triptych feature telling three separate tales of the city. Bong's segment is about a man who has lived for a decade as a Hikikomori—the term used in Japan for people unable to adjust to society who do not leave their homes—and what happens when he falls in love with a pizza delivery girl.[25] Bong's fourth feature film Mother (2009) is the story of a doting mother who struggles to save her disabled son from a murder accusation. It premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival to much acclaim, particularly for actress Kim Hye-ja; she went on to win the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress.[26] Mother repeated its critical success locally and in the international film festival circuit. The film appeared on many film critics' \"best-of\" lists of 2010.[27] In 2011, Bong contributed to 3.11 A Sense of Home, another anthology film, addressing the theme of home. The films were made by 21 filmmakers in response to the devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit the Tohoku region of Japan on March 11, 2011. The film screened on the first anniversary of the disaster.[28] In Bong's short film Iki, a teenage girl finds a toddler, seemingly dead, on a beach.[29] That same year, Bong served as a jury member for the 27th Sundance Film Festival.[30][31] He was also the head of the jury for the Caméra d'Or section of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival[32][33] and 2013 Edinburgh International Film Festival.[34]\n\n### 2013–2018: American co-productions\n\nBong at the 2013 Deauville American Film Festival\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBong's first English-language film, Snowpiercer, was released in 2013. It is based on the graphic novel Le Transperceneige (1982) by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette,[35][36][37][38][39] and set largely on a futuristic train where those on board are separated according to their social status. The film premiered at Times Square on July 29, 2013, in Seoul, South Korea,[40] before screening at the Deauville American Film Festival as the closing film on September 7, 2013,[41] the Berlin International Film Festival as part of Berlin's Forum Sidebar on February 7, 2014,[42] opening the LA Film Festival on June 11, 2014,[43] and the Edinburgh International Film Festival on June 22, 2014.[44] Upon release in cinemas, Snowpiercer was met with near-universal praise and strong ticket sales,[45] both in South Korea and abroad. On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 253 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Snowpiercer offers an audaciously ambitious action spectacular for filmgoers numb to effects-driven blockbusters.\"[46] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[47] As of April 2014, it is the tenth highest-grossing domestic film in South Korea, with 9,350,141 admissions. The film also holds the domestic record for the fastest movie (domestic and foreign) to reach four million admissions, which it achieved in its fifth day after the premiere, and another record for the highest weekend figure (from Friday to Sunday) for a Korean film, with 2.26 million viewers.[48] In addition to receiving several awards and nominations, Snowpiercer appeared on several critics' lists of the ten best films of 2014.[49]\n\nBong (far right) at the Japanese premiere of Okja (2017).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2015, Bong's next film, Okja, was announced.[50][unreliable source?] On April 30, 2015, screenwriter Jon Ronson announced on his Twitter account that he was writing the second draft of Bong's screenplay for the film.[51] Darius Khondji joined the film as cinematographer in February 2016.[52] Filming for the project began in April 2016.[53] It premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or and sparked controversy due to it being produced by Netflix.[54] The film was met with boos, mixed with applause, during a press screening at the film festival, once the Netflix logo appeared on screen and again during a technical glitch; the film was projected in the incorrect aspect ratio for its first seven minutes.[55][56][57] The festival later issued an apology to the filmmakers.[58] However, despite the studio's negative response, the film itself received a four-minute standing ovation following its actual premiere.[59] The film was later released on Netflix on June 28, 2017, and received positive reviews.[60] On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 235 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.54/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Okja sees Bong Joon Ho continuing to create defiantly eclectic entertainment – and still hitting more than enough of his narrative targets in the midst of a tricky tonal juggling act.\"[61] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[62] New York Times critic A. O. Scott wrote: \"Okja is a miracle of imagination and technique, and Okja insists, with abundant mischief and absolute sincerity, that she possesses a soul.\"[63]\n\n### 2019–present: Parasite and Mickey 17\n\nBong and stars at an 2019 press event for Parasite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2019, Bong directed the South Korean film Parasite,[64] a black comedy thriller about a poor family that infiltrates a wealthy household by gaining employment as unrelated staff members. The film premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or, becoming the first Korean film to receive the award and the first film to do so with a unanimous vote since Blue Is the Warmest Colour at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.[65] On June 16, 2019, the film won the $60,000 Sydney Film Prize at the Sydney Film Festival[66][67] where it was in competition alongside 11 features from countries such as North Macedonia, Brazil and Spain, and Australian entrants Mirrah Foulkes (for Judy and Punch) and Ben Lawrence (for Hearts and Bones).[68]\n\nParasite was released in South Korea by CJ Entertainment on May 30, 2019, and in the United States by Neon on October 11, 2019. It received unanimous critical acclaim and earned $266 million at the worldwide box office, becoming Bong's highest-grossing release.[69] On the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 99% based on 451 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.37/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"An urgent, brilliantly layered look at timely social themes, Parasite finds writer-director Bong Joon Ho in near-total command of his craft.\"[70] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 96 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[71] Regarding motivation of the film's creation, Bong hoped that he would live a comfortable life, however he was disappointed several times in reality. He wanted to express the anxiety, sadness, and deep fear that came from reality of life via his film.[72][73]\n\nBong at the Munich International Film Festival in July 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout the 2019–2020 film awards season, Bong and the film received numerous accolades. Bong received the Hollywood Filmmaker Award at the 23rd Hollywood Film Awards[74] and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director (tied with Sam Mendes for 1917) at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards.[75][76] He was also nominated[77] for Best Director and Best Screenplay (shared with Han Jin-won) at the 77th Golden Globe Awards,[78] with the film itself winning Best Foreign Language Film.[79] This was the first Golden Globe Award nomination (and win) for any South Korean film.[80] Parasite also became the first non-English-language film to win the top prize at the 70th American Cinema Editors Eddie Awards when film editor Yang Jin-mo won Best Edited Feature Film – Dramatic.[81][82] At the 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast of Parasite won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, making history as the first foreign-language film to win in the category.[83] At the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, Parasite was nominated in four categories,[84] winning two awards—Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Not in the English Language.[85]\n\nParasite was later submitted as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film for the 92nd Academy Awards,[86] making the December shortlist.[87] It eventually became the first South Korean film to receive an Academy Award nomination in any category, receiving a total of six nominations and winning four awards—Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. This was also the first time a non-English language film won the Academy Award[88][2] for Best Picture[89] and the first time Asian writers won Academy Awards for screenwriting.[90][91] While accepting the Academy Award for Best Director, Bong expressed his deep respect and appreciation for fellow nominees Martin Scorsese, who inspired his work, and Quentin Tarantino, who supported and praised his earlier films.[92] He also mentioned a quote from Scorsese—\"The most personal is the most creative\"—that also inspired him, which prompted the audience to give Scorsese an enthusiastic standing ovation.[93] Scorsese later wrote and sent a heartfelt letter to Bong after Parasite's Oscar success.[94] Parasite's Best Picture win was well received by film critics, who hailed it as a major step forward for popular appreciation of international film and for restoring the legitimacy of the Academy. \"The academy gave best picture to the actual best picture\", wrote Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times, who continued that the film awards body was \"startled ... into recognizing that no country's cinema has a monopoly on greatness\".[95] Conversely, U.S. president Donald Trump lambasted Parasite's win at a campaign rally in Colorado on February 20, 2020, questioning why a foreign film won Best Picture;[96] his comments were widely condemned as \"xenophobic\" and \"racist\".[97] Distribution company Neon responded by tweeting: \"Understandable, he can't read.\"[98]\n\nBong with Robert Pattinson in South Korea in 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn January 2020, an HBO six-hour limited series based on the film, with Bong and Adam McKay serving as executive producers, currently in early development, was announced as an upcoming project.[99] Bong has stated that the series, also titled Parasite, will explore stories \"that happen in between the sequences in the film\".[100][101] In February 2020, Mark Ruffalo was rumored to star while Tilda Swinton was confirmed to being cast as the female lead.[102][103][104] Swinton left the project in October 2022[105] and Bong confirmed in February 2025 that the series was still in development.[106]\n\nIn September 2021, Bong served as jury president of the 78th Venice International Film Festival.[107] In January 2022, it was revealed Bong's next film would be Mickey 17, an adaptation of Edward Ashton's novel Mickey7. Bong was given an advance manuscript of the novel in late 2021. The film, which was written, co-produced and directed by Bong, is being distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and stars Robert Pattinson, Bong's first collaborations with both.[108] In May 2022, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette, and Mark Ruffalo joined the cast and the film entered into pre-production at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden.[109][110] In July 2022, Steven Yeun joined the cast. Production commenced on August 1, 2022.[111][112] Mickey 17 premiered at the 75th Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2025,[113] before being theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures in South Korea on February 28, and in the United States on March 7, 2025.\n\n#### Upcoming projects\n\nIn February 2021, Bong said that he had been working on two scripts after completing Parasite, one in English and one in Korean, and that he had finished one of the two. He said that the Korean film \"is located in Seoul and has unique elements of horror and action\" and that the English film is \"a drama film based on a true event that happened in 2016.\"[114] Bong is preparing an untitled Korean animated film as one of his next projects. This animation was conceived since 2018 and is said to be about deep-sea creatures and humans.[115] In 2024, Bong confirmed that the animated film about deep-sea creatures and Seoul horror films were still in development, and he also expressed interest in making a biographical film about a historical figure, being inspired by the recent film Harbin.[116]\n\n## Inspirations and style\n\nAs a child, Bong watched Black Orpheus (1959) on Korean television, which made a big impact on him. While he was in film school, Bong watched the Qatsi trilogy (1982–2002).[117] His main inspirations are from Guillermo del Toro—his favorite films of del Toro's are The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006)—and Nagisa Ōshima, describing Oshima as \"one of the most controversial masters\".[117] Bong also studied the films of Martin Scorsese and cited him as one of his major influences during his acceptance speech for the Academy Award for Best Director when he won for Parasite (2019).[118] His process when working with actors is to make them feel comfortable and gives them a high amount of freedom when performing, even allowing them to improvise. Bong has commented that he doesn't like the term 'Directing Actors' as he feels that \"acting is the actor's job and it's something I don't feel like I can direct\".\n\nThe most defining trademark of Bong's films are their sudden tone shifts (sometimes within scenes) between drama, darkness, and black or slapstick humor. During a TIFF Master Class at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, Bong claimed: \"I'm never really conscious of the tone shifts or the comedy that I apply, I never think 'oh, the tone shifts at this point or it's funny at this point.' I'm never conscious of it during the filmmaking or screenwriting process.\"[119] Bong also uses real filming locations or specially built sets in all his films as opposed to green screens, even to the extent of filming in Seoul's sewers for The Host (2006); Memories of Murder (2003) set a local record for the number of locations it used.\n\nIn an interview promoting Snowpiercer (2013), actor Ed Harris described Bong's shooting process as \"cutting while filming\". Harris also said that \"if I was doing a scene and it was a couple of pages long, he would never shoot the whole thing one way. He'd shoot a few lines, like the first beat of the scene, and then he would turn the camera around and get my part for that part of the scene. Then he would change the angle a little bit\". He additionally noted that \"the editor was sitting right there on the stage, right below the set with a big tent, actually getting the footage as they were filming.[120] Fellow actor Daniel Henshall echoed Harris's sentiment calling Bong \"precise\" and \"very sure of what he wants\". Henshall continued by saying: \"He only shoots what he's going to use in the edit. Doesn't do any coverage. I've never worked like that before. You're trimming the fat before you've shot it, which is very brave, because when you get into the edit, if something's missing you haven't got it. He's been planning it for four years that meticulously.\"[121]\n\nIn 2015, Bong's list of 50 inspirational films was published on the French streaming platform LaCinetek.[122] His list includes three works by Martin Scorsese (Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Goodfellas) and two films each by Shohei Imamura, Kim Ki-young, Alfred Hitchcock, François Truffaut, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa and Stanley Kubrick.\n\n## Personal life\n\nBong married screenwriter Jung Sun-young in 1995. They have a son together, Bong Hyo-min, who is also a filmmaker.[72][73][123] In 2009, Bong had a tattoo of a bird done on his left arm to celebrate the release of Mother, and pay homage to a scene in the film.[14]\n\nBong was a member and supporter of the now-defunct Democratic Labor Party during the 2000s,[124][125] reportedly starting in June 2003.[126] He left the Democratic Labor Party in March 2008 and joined its successor, the New Progressive Party, the following month;[126] he later voted for the latter party in the 2012 election.[124][127] On December 7, 2024, he was among the roughly 2,520 South Korean film industry employees who demanded South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol be impeached and arrested for declaring martial law.[124][128]\n\nIn February 2025, Bong revealed he is a fan of K-pop and considers Blackpink his favorite group.[129] During an interview with BuzzFeed the following month, Bong named all the South Korean members and excluded mentioning Lisa, who is from Thailand. Many Thai users on social media platforms, especially Twitter, subsequently accused Bong of racial discrimination.[129][130][131]\n\n## Filmography\n\n| Year    | Title                   | Title                  | Distributor           |\n|---------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Year    | English                 | Korean                 | Distributor           |\n| 2000    | Barking Dogs Never Bite | 플란다스의 개                | Cinema Service        |\n| 2003    | Memories of Murder      | 살인의 추억                 | CJ Entertainment      |\n| 2006    | The Host                | 괴물                     | Showbox               |\n| 2009    | Mother                  | 마더                     | CJ Entertainment      |\n| 2013    | Snowpiercer             | 설국열차                   | CJ Entertainment      |\n| 2017    | Okja                    | 옥자                     | Netflix               |\n| 2019    | Parasite                | 기생충                    | CJ Entertainment      |\n| 2025    | Mickey 17               | 미키17                   | Warner Bros.

His films have received many distinctions in the festival circuit, rendering him one of the most important contemporary Asian film directors.\n\nHis major festival awards include the Golden Lion at 69th Venice International Film Festival for Pietà, a Silver Lion for Best Director at 61st Venice International Film Festival for 3-Iron, a Silver Bear for Best Director at 54th Berlin International Film Festival for Samaritan Girl, and the Un Certain Regard prize at 2011 Cannes Film Festival for Arirang. His most widely known feature is Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (2003), included in film critic Roger Ebert's Great Movies. Two of his films served as official submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film as South Korean entries. He gave scripts to several of his former assistant directors including Juhn Jai-hong (Beautiful and Poongsan) and Jang Hoon (Rough Cut).\n\n## Early life and education\n\nKim was born on 20 December 1960 in Ponghwa, North Kyŏngsang. In 1990, he went to Paris to study fine arts, but instead he spent two years working there on the streets as a portrait painter.[1][2] He served for five years in the South Korean Marine Corps, becoming a non-commissioned officer.[3]\n\n## Career\n\nAfter returning to South Korea, Kim began his career as a screenwriter and won first prize in a screenplay contest held by the Korean Film Council in 1995.[4] In the following year, Kim made his debut as a director with a low budget movie titled Crocodile (1996). The film received sensational reviews from movie critics in South Korea. Ki-duk said that his international breakthrough occurred with The Isle at the Toronto International Film Festival.[5] His 2000 film Real Fiction was entered into the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival.[6]\n\nIn 2003, Ki-duk released Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring. The film was praised by numerous critics, including critic Peter Bradshaw, who considered the film to be his masterpiece and one of the great works of modern Korean cinema. \"A potent and enigmatic parable which manages to be both serene and gripping at the same time [...] It is that rarest of things - a genuinely spiritual film.\"[7] The film work is included in critic Roger Ebert's Great Movies.[8]\n\nIn 2004, he received Best Director awards at two different film festivals, for two different films. At the Berlin International Film Festival, he was awarded for Samaritan Girl (2004),[9] and at the Venice Film Festival he won for 3-Iron (also 2004).[10] In 2011, his documentary film Arirang received an award for best film in the Un Certain Regard category from the Cannes Film Festival.[11] In 2012, his film Pietà received the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival.[12] In 2015, it was announced in Beijing at the Asian Brilliant Stars, a section of the upcoming Berlin International Film Festival that Kim would direct his largest budget to date film Who Is God?, produced by Hollywood producers Stephen Castor and Jim Rygiel (three-time Academy Award winner) under the banner of their production company Its Just Us Productions, along with Chinese production company Film Carnival (Hangzhou). The film was financed by CITIC Guoan, Huafeng Investment Consultation and Its Just Us Productions, (China Daily News).\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Assault allegations\n\nIn August 2017, an actress referred to as \"Actress \"A\" by prosecutors filed a complaint against Kim Ki-duk through Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office. In the complaint the actress accused Kim of slapping her face and forcing her to do an unscripted sex scene on the set of his film Moebius. In December 2017, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office fined Kim Ki-duk for $4,450 (KRW 5 million) for physical assault but didn't charge him otherwise citing lack of physical evidence.[13]\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the South Korean TV channel MBC's investigative report show PD Notebook aired an episode titled \"Movie director Kim Ki-duk, Master's Naked Face\" with more accusations from Actress A and two others (Actress B and C as they mentioned in the show). Actresses accused Kim and his frequent collaborator, actor Cho Jae-hyun of verbal and physical sexual harassment and rape.[14][15] \nIn response Kim filed false accusation and defamation suits against the accusers and PD Notebook.[16]\n\nAfter that on August 7, 2018, MBC aired a second episode of the PD Notebook show \"Master's Naked Face. Aftermath\" with more accusations from other actresses and staff members against Kim and Cho. In that episode journalists interviewed a Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Special Investigation Unit on Sexual Violence official about the cases. The official explained that the police approached the survivors and established the facts behind accusations but could not indict actor Cho and director Kim because of expired statute of limitation.[17]\n\nIn January 2019, Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office decided to drop the criminal lawsuits filed by Kim Ki-duk against actresses and PD Notebook because \"there was neither proof that actress' initial accusation was false, nor was there evidence that the news show had been programmed with the purpose of defamation\".[18]\n\nIn March 2019 Kim Ki-duk filed another lawsuit in civil court against Actress A and PD Notebook seeking $885,740 (KRW 1 billion) in damages. The lawsuit was ruled by court in defendants' favor on October 28, 2020. The court also ordered Kim to pay legal fees for the defendants.[19]\n\n### Animal cruelty allegations\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification delayed the release of Kim Ki-duk's The Isle (2000) in the United Kingdom because of instances of animal cruelty in the film. Concerning scenes in which a frog is skinned after being beaten to death and fish are mutilated, the director stated, \"We cooked all the fish we used in the film and ate them, expressing our appreciation. I've done a lot of cruelty on animals in my films. And I will have a guilty conscience for the rest of my life.\"[20]\n\nTo a U.S. interviewer who suggested that scenes such as these are \"very disturbing and [seem] to place an obstacle to the films  [sic] reception, or... distribution, to other countries\", Kim said, \"Yes, I did worry about that fact. But the way I see it, the food that we eat today is no different. In America you eat beef, pork, and kill all these animals. And the people who eat these animals are not concerned with their slaughter. Animals are part of this cycle of consumption. It looks more cruel onscreen, but I don't see the difference. And yes, there's a cultural difference, and maybe Americans will have a problem with it - but if they can just be more sensitive to what is acceptable in different countries I'd hope they wouldn't have too many issues with what's shown on-screen.\"[21]\n\n## Death\n\nOn 11 December 2020, Kim died from complications caused by COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia at the age of 59, nine days before his 60th birthday.[22][23][24][25][26]\n\n## Filmography\n\n|   Year | English title                              | Director   | Producer   | Writer   | Editor   | Notes

            "content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nR/HORROR, known as Dreadit by our subscribers is the premier horror entertainment community on Reddit. For more than a decade /R/HORROR has been reddit.com's gateway to all things Horror: from movies &amp; TV, to books &amp; games.\n\n# The Wailing (2016): Comprehensive analysis and explanation\n\n-SPOILER WARNING-\n\nCurrently the most prevalent theory, and why it's wrong:\n\nThe most common theory on the internet is that the two shamans are bad and the girl in white is good.\n\nThere are a few details in the movie that suggest that the above conclusion is false:\n\n- The forest shaman, on the day after his interrupted ritual on the dead guy in the car, hurries to the car in an agitated manner. When he sees that the dead body isn't there, he is genuinely afraid and anxious.\n\nWhy would he be afraid in this manner if he had achieved his intended goal of resurrecting the corpse (assuming he's the antagonist)?\n\n2) When Jong-goo's deputy is telling Jong-goo and the deacon the story about how the shaman uses the photos to infect/possess the dead, he is very obviously (both to the audience and the characters) in a non-lucid state. It appears as though he is possessed when he is relating this story.\n\nIf the deputy is indeed a trustworthy character why does he kill his family like the rest of the possessed?\n\n3) If the invited city shaman, Il-Gwang, had evil intentions, why was he invited all the way from the city? Why did he want a large sum of money to perform the death hex if his motive was to hurt the family? Couldn't he just kill them and take their money?\n\nIt is not surprising that a lot of people fell for the wrong interpretation. The movie ingeniously tries to sway the audience and lead them to false conclusions just as the evil spirit deceives and misdirects the people of the village. In oriental superstition evil spirits are notorious for their deceptive ability. They always choose deception to coax their victims rather than using a straightforward approach.\n\nNow I'll go into an analysis of all of the important hints and events in the movie and what they mean. If you don't care about the hints and want to know exactly what happened in reality, then go to the end to see the summary of important events.\n\nThe Woman with the Trinkets\n\nThe woman in white seems to always wear or carry around trinkets. The trinkets and apparel she is wearing are from people who are possessed. Late in the movie you see her wearing the cardigan of an infected girl and you see on the ground near her there is Hyo-jin's hair clip.\n\nA far less obvious trinket is apparent when you see her for the first time in the movie. During our first encounter with her, she is wearing Park Chun-Bae's jacket. You see the jacket again later being worn by Park Chun-Bae when he is dead in the car. When the girl was wearing the jacket Park Chun-Bae was likely already possessed.\n\nAn Officer Possessed\n\nJong-goo's deputy, Oh Sung-bok, was the first to come up with the speculation that the rashes could not have been caused by mushrooms. He later does a complete 180 on this matter and starts dissuading Jong-goo from investigating the illness further. It is my opinion that Oh Sung-bok got possessed and this is what caused his 180. After his possession, all of the information that he provides is misinformation.\n\nThe possession took place on the night the two officers (Jong-goo and Oh Sung-bok) are visited by the naked possessed girl at the police station. The evil spirit attempted to posses both officers that night in their sleep, but it could not posses Jong-goo because Jong-goo was too pure or strong willed.\n\nThe morning after that night is the first time we see Jong-goo wake up in an agitated state, waking from a nightmare. In his sleep he says \"Stop goddam it!\", and he wakes up saying \"Stop it you dirty slut! You whore!\" This suggests to me that Jong-goo resisted his possession. Oh Sung-bok that same night was unable to resist possession leading to his 180 opinion change about the rashes and the forest shaman and also leading to his future misdirection.\n\nPossessed  Oh Sung-bok doesn't want Jong-goo to investigate the forest shaman because the forest shaman might reveal the truth about himself (forest shaman never does reveal the truth about himself because he believes that everyone has already made up their minds and the truth won't matter).\n\nThe Biggest Misdirection\n\nThe biggest misdirection that possessed Oh Sung-bok is part of is him leading everyone to believe that the forest shaman was using the photos in his hut to possess people. Look at how Oh Sung-bok behaves after seeing the photos and during the car trip back, when he claims the forest shaman to be a criminal. It is obvious that he is not speaking, but the evil spirit that possessed him is speaking. In the car Jong-goo even asks Oh Sung-bok \"What's wrong with you? Did you get bit?\" and says \"You're scaring me man. Snap out of it\", this is because Oh Sung-bok was behaving so oddly.\n\nThe True Motive of the Photos\n\nThe photos taken by the shamans are not used with malicious intent. Instead, they use the photos to perform rituals so that the dead cannot become possessed. The biggest clue for this comes when the Japanese forest shaman takes a photo of the dead Park Chun-Bae in his car. He surrounds the car with candles and takes the photo home to perform his ritual. The forest shaman's ritual is interrupted, and the next day we see the wounded forest shaman run to the car. He is visibly upset when he sees that Park Chun-Bae's dead body is not there. This confirms forest shaman's suspicion that his ritual failed and Park Chun-Bae dead body is possessed.\n\nThe protection of dead bodies against possession is a common theme in oriental superstition. You can see this theme in the movie Rigor Mortis (2013) as well. The rituals send away the souls from the bodies so that the souls cannot become possessed.\n\nPark Chun-Bae's body is the first dead body to be resurrected out of all the deaths in the village. This is because the previous dead bodies have had successful soul sending rituals done on them by the forest shaman.\n\nThe Possession of Hyo-jin\n\nHyo-jin is first contacted by the evil spirit on the night she delivers fresh clothes to her father at the police station. When she leaves the station she drops her hairclip. Jong-goo discovers the clip, but when he is about to pick it up he interrupts himself recalling the naked girl from the prior night. We never see him pick up the clip. This clip ends up in the hands of the woman in white.\n\nHyo-jin initially resists full possession. We see her recollecting a nightmare \"someone keeps banging on the door, trying to get in\". I believe that her resistance is facilitated by the forest shaman who uses her shoe to help in a resistance ritual. The next day, Jong-goo, deputy and deacon visit forest shaman. Possessed deputy Oh Sung-bok steals the shoe from forest shaman's place. When Jong-goo returns home with the shoe, we see that Hyo-jin is now fully possessed.\n\nIl-Gwang and the case of Mistaken Identity\n\nWe see that a shaman is invited from the city in order to help Hyo-jin. His name is Il-Gwang. During Il-Gwang's investigation of Hyo-jin, he inquires about someone Jong-goo met, someone he was not supposed to meet. Jong-goo mistakenly thinks that Il-Gwang is referring to forest shaman during this inquiry, but Il-Gwang was actually referring to the woman in white.\n\nDue to this case of mistaken identity, Il-Gwang mistakenly believes that forest shaman is the evil spirit. So, Il-Gwang attempts to kill forest shaman with his death hex.\n\nTwo Failed Rituals\n\nThe pain inflicted by the ongoing death hex causes forest shaman to stop his ritual to protect Park Chun-Bae's body against possession. Jong-goo interrupts Il-Gwang's death hex ritual, and as a result forest shaman has a chance to live another day.\n\nThe Death and Possession of Forest Shaman\n\nAfter forest shaman almost dies to the death hex and crawls into bed, you can see a brief glimpse of the woman in white ominously wandering outside. This is an important piece of allusion. The woman in white wants forest shaman to die so that she can possess him.\n\nThe next day when Jong-goo and gang chase forest shaman, you can see that forest shaman is obviously very distressed. If forest shaman were really a spirit, or a ghost, or a demon, he wouldn't be scared in this manner because people cannot kill ghosts.\n\nForest shaman is finally killed by the car and thrown off the ridge. There is no shaman around to take a picture of forest shaman's dead body and perform a final passage ritual, so forest shaman's body is free to become possessed. Indeed, the forest shaman that we see in the final act is the possessed dead body of forest shaman.\n\nThe Grand Final Meeting Between Deacon and the Possessed Dead Body of Forest Shaman\n\nFirst off all, the set-up for the meeting; why does the deacon decide to visit the forest shaman's home in the wilderness? The deacon is lying in a hospital bed with bandaged cheek and looking at the TV. The mushroom illness is spreading throughout the village and making people deranged, according to news reports. Next, the deacon visits Oh Sung-bok's house. Oh Sung-bok by now had already killed his family confirming that he had been possessed.\n\nThe look in the deacon's eyes as he looks at On Sung-bok is a call back to the look in his eyes much earlier in the movie. When On Sung-bok, Jong-goo and the deacon are leaving forest shaman's home by car after their first visit, you see several times the camera focuses on the deacon as he listens intently to possessed On Sung-bok's intricately weaved false narrative.\n\nIt is important to note that when On Sung-bok et al. are preparing to visit forest shaman for the first time we see him visibly wearing a cross. On Sung-bok is still wearing the cross when he is on the floor, after he has killed his family.\n\nWatching possessed On Sung-bok puts doubt into the mind of the young deacon. He must visit the house of the forest shaman not only to confirm his suspicion that the forest shaman is responsible for the continued possessions in the village, but also to reaffirm his faith. Under this light, the dialogue between the deacon and possessed forest shaman means a lot more.\n\nDeacon, desperate to reaffirm his own belief, asks the possessed forest shaman what his true form is.\n\nPossessed forest shaman responds, what do you think is my true form?\n\nDeacon says, the devil, you're the devil. - The word choice is important here. He said, \"You're the devil\", not I think you're the devil, not I believe you are the devil, not I suspect you are the devil. There is no doubt in his tone.\n\nDeacon then presses possessed forest shaman for a response, what is your true form? - Deacon must get confirmation about his beliefs.\n\nPossessed forest shaman says: \"You have already said it, I'm the devil.\" - \"Isn't that right? You are already certain I'm the devil. That's why you came here... carrying that sickle\" - \"My words, whatever I say, won't change your mind.\"\n\nDeacon refutes, \"No, that is not true.\" - he is more hesitant now, more doubtful about his belief.\n\nTo this possessed forest shaman responds: \"There is no doubt.\" - doubt here has a double meaning. There is no doubt that my claims are correct, there is no doubt in your mind about your own beliefs. \"You came here to confirm your suspicions about me. \" -  confirmation bias.\n\nNow, decon gets upset and emotional, he shouts \"No! If you say you are not the devil and reveal your true form to me - I'll leave you alone.\" - This is the first time that deacon challenges his own beliefs. This is the first time he allows the idea that forest shaman might not be the devil to enter into his mind. He could have questioned the false narrative prior to the death of the forest shaman, the forest shaman could have lived, but by the time he began questioning the false narrative it was already too late. Now, the forest shaman is dead and possessed.\n\nFurthermore, the proof that the deacon requires is a revelation of the true form. When forest shaman was human, he would have no way of proving that he was not the devil, because his true form was the human form. This line of reasoning has similarities to the Salem Witch trials.\n\nThe Mirrored Interrogation\n\nEarlier in the movie we saw deacon and Jong-goo are interrogating the real, unpossessed forest shaman. The interrogation then went in a similar vein to the deacon's solo interrogation in the cave, but Jong-goo had made up his mind much more steadfastly about the intentions of the forest shaman because he had fully adopted the false narrative.\n\nJong-goo asks forest shaman why he was there.\n\nTo this forest shaman hesitates and responds, \"To travel.\"\n\nJong-goo then says \"Tell him to confess, or I'll throw him in jail\", but deacon translates this to \"Tell us the truth.\"\n\nForest shaman responds: \"Even if I told you, you would not believe me.\"\n\nAfter this Jong-goo starts cursing, making threats and repeating the false narrative.\n\nJust as the possessed forest shaman claims in the cave, they had already made up their mind and were only looking for confirmation of their beliefs. Nothing he could have said would have swayed their mind, because they had already bought in to the deceit of the evil spirit.\n\nThe Liar, the Truthsayer and the Nihilist\n\nThe girl in white is the liar along with all she has possessed, including the deputy, Oh Sung-bok.\n\nIl-Gwang is the truthsayer. He has no incentive to lie. He has no ulterior motive besides money.\n\nThe forest shaman is the nihilist. He believes that the truth won't matter because nobody will believe him.\n\nAll of the above I have a low degree of uncertainty about. The following is something I'm unsure about as it requires a lot of assumptions:\n\nThe Girl's Trap\n\nThe girl in white, or the evil spirit, says that she has laid a trap for Il-Gwang and that all Jong-goo needs to do is wait for the trap to be triggered.\n\nThe evil spirit had a lot of incentive to kill Il-Gwang. Il-Gwang is the only shaman remaining who can take photos of the dead in order to perform the sending ritual, thereby making the dead impervious to possession and resurrection.\n\nWhen Il-Gwang was trying to escape the village by car, the evil spirit sent him visions so that he would return and get caught in her trap. How exactly the trap works is unclear, but it is clear that the flowers in the archway is the trap.\n\nYou will notice that when Il-Gwang first comes to town and goes to Jong-goo's house, he very carefully inspects the archway and the hanging bushes before entering through the archway. At the end of the movie when Il-Gwang enters the archway, he again hesitates before entering.\n\nIt is clear that Jong-goo triggers and breaks the trap when he enters to archway to find his murdered family. This is why the evil spirit is upset when she couldn't stop Jong-goo from leaving her to go back to his house. The trap was intended for Il-Gwang, but Jong-goo's triggering of the trap foiled her plans.\n\nThere are a few possibilities as to how the trap might work:\n\nCurrent best hypothesis about the trap: The flower trap is a ward against Il-Gwang. This is what stops him from passing the girl earlier and induces blood/regurgitation. Since he cannot pass, he cannot render assistance to the family. If Jong-goo passes the trap, the trap breaks; this is why Il-Gwang pleads with Jong-goo to go to the house.\n\nThe evil spirit/girl trying to keep Jong-goo with her has a dual purpose: 1) It stops Jong-goo from breaking the trap, 2) She is trying to keep Jong-goo with her in order to possess him. The possession requires time and requires that the victim is fully convinced/persuaded/deceived by the evil spirit. As she lies and convinces Jong-goo of her story, she draws closer and closer to Jong-goo and finally, at the later stages of her possession attempt, she is able to touch Jong-goo's hand. Jong-goo sees his daughter's hairpin and starts having doubts about her lies, this is when he is able to break free from the possession attempt.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1) If someone goes past the flowers, the flowers wither. The person who moves past the flowers become impure or a sinner, and thereby they are vulnerable to being interacted with/possessed by the evil spirit. Jong-goo had already sinned when he killed forest shaman, this is why the evil spirit could touch his hand. When Jong-goo passes the trap, it has no effect on him because he was already a sinner, but him passing triggers the trap and as a result it cannot be triggered again when Il-Gwang approaches the trap later.\n\nPossibility 2) We see very early in the movie during the investigation of the first murder scene, Jong-goo notices withered flowers at the pig farmer Hueng-guk's house. One room in the farm had a nest-like bed which we know is used in death hex rituals where a possessed person sleeps in the bed while the shaman attempts to perform a ritual to kill the perceived evil spirit.\n\nBased on the level of infection in the Hueng-guk's face, we know that the he had been possessed for some time. Cho, the ginseng farmer, was possibly a shaman who was called to exorcise Hueng-guk, but because Cho triggered the flower trap, the ritual backfired (we know from Il-Gwang's words earlier that the hex is prone to backfiring). The backfire caused Hueng-guk's possession to accelerate and as a result he kills Cho, and later his family.\n\nPossibility 3) The trap causes the possession to spread. The evil spirit wanted to infect Il-Gwang so that he could carry it out of the village and infect others beyond the village. She is upset when Jong-goo unintentionally ruins her plan by triggering the trap because all of the village is already almost dead and she has nobody else to infect/possess.\n\nPossibility 4) The evil spirit was lying about the trap to keep Jong-goo with her for longer so that she could possess him. The possession possibly takes some time to complete. If the rooster crowed 3 times then she would have enough time to possess him. Watch how she draws closer and closer to him and touches him near the end. She fails the possession when he sees his daughter's hair clip and he starts doubting her.\n\nPossibility 5) The flower in the archway helps the evil spirit create a barrier so that the shaman can't enter. This is why she is able to make him bleed/vomit earlier when he tries to pass. When Jong-goo passes the barrier, he breaks the protective barrier allowing the shaman to enter.\n\nSummary of important events:\n\n- Jong-goo and deputy go to investigate first murder.\n- That night they get visit from naked possessed lady. Later that night the evil spirit attempts to possess both of them in their sleep. Jong-goo's possession fails, but deputy gets possessed. Deputy will constantly lie and misdirect from now on.\n- On the night of investigation of second family death, Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin, comes to the police station to drop off clothes and on the way back she gets possessed.\n- Jong-goo meets and interacts with girl in white/evil spirit at the site of second family death. She lies about the forest shaman.\n- Hyo-jin starts showing signs of possession compelling Jong-goo to take action\n- Jong-goo, possessed deputy and a deacon go to visit forest shaman in the woods.\n- At shaman's house they discover a ritual room and a room with lots of photos/belongings.\n- On the way back to the village, possessed deputy lies and tells deacon and Jong-goo that the forest shaman was using the pictures to possess people. This is a lie. Infact, he was using them to perform protection and soul sending rituals so that the dead couldn't become possessed.\n- Hyo-jin's possession symptoms increase because the deputy recovered her shoe from forest shaman's house. Forest shaman was using the shoe to cast a protection ritual.\n- Jong-goo and deacon visit forest shaman again and interrogate him. Forest shaman says that they wouldn't believe the truth.\n- Second shaman, Il-Gwang, comes from the city. He asks Jong-goo about someone Jong-goo had met who he was not supposed to meet. Jong-goo mistakenly says the forest shaman; infact the person he was not supposed to meet was the girl in white.\n- Il-Gwang casts a death hex on forest shaman. Forest shaman is simultaneously casting a final passage ritual on the dead guy in the car, Park Chun-Bae. Both these rituals are interrupted. Forest Shaman does not die from the death hex and Park Chun-Bae's dead body is vulnerable to possession.\n- The next day, Jong-goo and gang visit forest shaman's house in the woods yet again. They chase and eventually kill forest shaman.\n- Il-Gwang sees the evil spirit, but she can't possess him. Instead, blood spurts out of his nose and he vomits. Il-Gwang attempts to escape the village, but the evil spirit won't let him leave.\n- The deacon sees the continued deaths in spite of the forest shaman's death and starts to have doubts. He visits the forest shaman to get some answers. Forest shaman is now possessed and he repeats what alive forest shaman said previously, the truth doesn't matter because nobody will believe him. Deacon vehemently disagrees, but now it's too late to ask for the real truth because forest shaman is already dead and possessed.\n- Jong-goo meets the evil spirit and gets a phone call from Il-Gwang. Il-Gwang tells the truth about the mistaken identity of the forest shaman and tells Jong-goo not to get tempted by the spirit. The evil spirit constantly lies and tries to keep Jong-goo with her. She has a dual motive for keeping him: 1) so that he doesn't trigger the flower trap that is meant for Il-Gwang (who will enter later) 2) (possibility) She needs time to possess Jong-goo and Jong-goo has to fully believe her before she can possess him.\n- Jong-goo leaves the evil spirit and triggers the flower trap. The evil spirit is upset because she couldn't accomplish either of her goals by failing to keep Jong-goo with her.\n- Il-Gwang comes to Jong-goo's house after everyone is dead. He can pass the archeway because the flower trap is dead, thanks to Jong-goo. He takes photos of the family so that he can cast soul passage ritual, so that the dead bodies don't become possessed.\n\nEdits:\n\n*made some revisions to the bold titles and added some more bold titles for clarity.\n\n*added some additional detail in the summary.\n\n*6/1 - Added current best hypothesis about the function of the trap and why the girl wants to keep Jong-goo with her.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\n.\n\nPublic\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\n\n## Top Posts\n\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of May 8, 2017\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of May 2017\n- Reddit \n\nreReddit: Top posts of 2017\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTOPICS\n\nInternet Culture (Viral)\n\n- Amazing\n- Animals &amp;amp; Pets\n- Cringe &amp;amp; Facepalm\n- Funny\n- Interesting\n- Memes\n- Oddly Satisfying\n- Reddit Meta\n- Wholesome &amp;amp; Heartwarming\n\nGames\n\n- Action Games\n- Adventure Games\n- Esports\n- Gaming Consoles &amp;amp; Gear\n- Gaming News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Mobile Games\n- Other Games\n- Role-Playing Games\n- Simulation Games\n- Sports &amp;amp; Racing Games\n- Strategy Games\n- Tabletop Games\n\nQ&amp;As\n\n- Q&amp;amp;As\n- Stories &amp;amp; Confessions\n\nTechnology\n\n- 3D Printing\n- Artificial Intelligence &amp;amp; Machine Learning\n- Computers &amp;amp; Hardware\n- Consumer Electronics\n- DIY Electronics\n- Programming\n- Software &amp;amp; Apps\n- Streaming Services\n- Tech News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Virtual &amp;amp; Augmented Reality\n\nPop Culture\n\n- Celebrities\n- Creators &amp;amp; Influencers\n- Generations &amp;amp; Nostalgia\n- Podcasts\n- Streamers\n- Tarot &amp;amp; Astrology\n\nMovies &amp; TV\n\n- Action Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Animated Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Comedy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Crime, Mystery, &amp;amp; Thriller Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Documentary Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Drama Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Fantasy Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Horror Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Movie News &amp;amp; Discussion\n- Reality TV\n- Romance Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Sci-Fi Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- Superhero Movies &amp;amp; Series\n- TV News &amp;amp; Discussion\n\nRESOURCES\n\nAbout Reddit\n\nAdvertise\n\nReddit Pro\n\n      BETA\n\nHelp\n\nBlog\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nCommunities\n\nBest of Reddit\n\nTopics\n\n<!-- image -->",

He eventually found work as a production assistant for a film company in Seoul. In 1962 he made his directorial debut with Tumgang a chal ikkŏra (“Farewell to the Duman River”). Over the next 10 years Im turned out some 50 movies, most of them B-movies such as Wŏnhan ŭi kŏri e nun i naerinda (1971; Revenge of Two Sons; also known in English as The Two Revengeful Hunchbacks).\n\nAlthough his original ambition had been to direct Hollywood-style action films and comedies, Im came to realize that he would always be hampered in this pursuit by limited financial and technical resources. Instead of trying to compete with Hollywood, he decided to focus on creating films that were uniquely Korean, exploring the country’s history and traditional culture. The movies that followed were not often great box-office successes, but they consistently earned critical praise. These included Chokpo (1978; The Genealogy), a historical drama that dealt with the Japanese occupation of Korea; Pul ŭi ttal (1983; Daughter of the Flames), which portrayed the shamanistic folk religion Dong-hak; Sŏp’yŏnje (1993; Sopyonje), about a family of p’ansori (folk opera) singers; and the Korean War epic T’aebaek sanmaek (1994; “The T’aebaek Mountains”).\n\nIn 2002 Im released Chihwaseon (Painted Fire), a masterly depiction of the life of the legendary, gifted, and self-destructive 19th-century painter Jang Seung-Up. The widely acclaimed Chihwaeson garnered Im much-deserved recognition outside South Korea. In May 2002 he became the first Korean to win the best director award at the Cannes film festival.\n\nIm released his 100th film, Cheon nyun hak (Beyond the Years), in 2007. Later films included Hwajang (2014; Revivre). His skill as a director won him many awards and other honours, including the Akira Kurosawa Award from the San Francisco International Film Festival (1998) and the French Legion of Honour (2007).",

Shin posthumously received the Gold Crown Cultural Medal, the country's top honor for an artist.\n\nIn 1978, Shin and Choi were kidnapped by order of Kim Jong-il, who wanted them to improve the North Korean film industry.  The couple remained in captivity for 8 years and Shin directed seven films for Kim, including An Emissary of No Return, Runaway (both 1984), Love, Love, My Love, Salt, and Pulgasari (produced in 1985), before they escaped in 1986 and sought asylum in the United States. Shin gained American citizenship in 1989, and continued to produce films in the United States, now under his adopted name Simon S. Sheen. He and Choi eventually returned to South Korea for his final years.\n\n## Early life\n\nSometime between 1925 and 1926,[a] Shin was born Shin Tae-ik (신태익)[1] or Shin Tae-seo (신태서)[6] in Chongjin, in the northeastern part of the Korean Peninsula, at the time occupied by Japan and currently a part of North Korea.[2][3][1][7] His father was a prominent doctor of Korean medicine.[6] Shin studied in Japan at Tokyo Fine Arts School, the predecessor of Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, before returning to Korea three years later.[8][14]\n\n## Career in South Korea (1946–1978)\n\nShin started his film career as an assistant production designer on Choi In-kyu's Viva Freedom!, the first Korean film made after the country achieved independence from Japan. During the \"Golden Age\" of South Korean cinema in the late 1950s and 1960s, Shin worked prolifically, often directing two or more films per year, earning the nickname the \"Prince of South Korean Cinema\".[15] Shin featured the Western princess, female sex workers for American soldiers, in The Evil Night (1952) and A Flower in Hell (1958).[16] The production company he started, Shin Films, produced around 300 films during the 1960s,[14] including Prince Yeonsan (1961), the winner of the Best Film prize at the first Grand Bell Awards ceremony and a Grand Bell Award-winning 1964 remake of Na Woon-gyu's 1926 Beongeoli Sam-ryong. His 1961 film The Houseguest and My Mother became the first South Korean submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.[17]\n\nDuring the 1970s, Shin became less active, while South Korea's cinema industry in general suffered under strict censorship and constant government interference. Most of the films he directed during this period ended up being flops.[14] After Shin ran afoul of the repressive government in 1978, Park Chung Hee closed Shin's studio.[18]\n\n## North Korean period (1978–1986)\n\nIn 1978, Shin's former wife, Choi Eun-hee, an actress who starred in many of his films, was kidnapped in Hong Kong and taken to North Korea. Shin himself came under suspicion of causing her disappearance and when he traveled to Hong Kong to investigate, he was kidnapped as well. The kidnappings were on orders of future leader Kim Jong-il, who wanted to establish a film industry for his country to sway international opinion regarding the views of the Workers' Party of Korea.[19][20] The North Korean authorities have denied the kidnapping accusations, claiming that Shin came to the country willingly. Shin and Choi made secret audiotapes of conversations with Kim Jong-il, which supported their story.[20][21][22][23]\n\nShin was put in comfortable accommodation, but after two escape attempts was placed in a prison for over two years. Once his re-education in North Korean ideology was thought complete, he was taken to Pyongyang in 1983 to meet Kim Jong-il and learn why he had been abducted to North Korea.[20] His ex-wife was brought to the same dinner party, where she first learned that Shin was also in North Korea. They remarried shortly afterwards, as suggested by Kim Jong-il.[22][24]\n\nFrom 1983 on, Shin directed seven films, with Kim Jong-il acting as an executive producer. The last and best-known of these films is Pulgasari, a giant-monster film similar to the Japanese Godzilla. In 1986, eight years after his kidnapping, Shin and his wife escaped while in Vienna for a film festival.[20] They managed to obtain political asylum from the US embassy in Vienna and Kim Jong-il became convinced that the couple had been kidnapped by the Americans. Shin and his wife lived covertly for two years in Reston, Virginia, under American protection and authorities debriefed the couple about Kim Jong-il and their experience in North Korea.[21][22][23]\n\n## Late life (1986–2006)\n\nAccording to Michael Lee, a former CIA agent, Shin and Choi adopted the names Simon Sheen and Theresa Sheen (respectively) and became American citizens in 1989, three years after their escape.[12] The couple moved to Los Angeles, where Shin worked in the 1990s as Simon Sheen, directing 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up and working as an executive producer for 3 Ninjas Kick Back and 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain.\n\nAt first, Shin was reluctant to go back to South Korea, because he feared that the government's security police would not believe the kidnapping story; he eventually returned to South Korea permanently in 1994 and continued to work on new movies. The same year, he was invited to the Cannes Film Festival as a jury member. His last movie as a director was an unreleased 2002 film called Kyeoul-iyagi (The Story of Winter).\n\nShin ended his career in 2004.[13] That year, Shin underwent a liver transplant. He died of complications caused by hepatitis two years later. At the time of his death he was planning a musical about Genghis Khan. South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun posthumously awarded Shin the Gold Crown Cultural Medal on April 12, 2006, the country's top honor for an artist.\n\n## In media\n\nIn 2015, an English language biography of his life (along with Choi Eun-hee), called A Kim Jong-Il Production: The Extraordinary True Story of a Kidnapped Filmmaker, was published by Paul Fischer.[25]\n\nIn January 2016, at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, in the World Cinema Documentary Competition, a documentary about the North Korean ordeal, entitled The Lovers and the Despot and directed by Robert Cannan and Ross Adam, was presented.[26]\n\nIn 2017, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a drama Lights, Camera, Kidnap!, based on Shin's ordeal, written by Lucy Catherine, directed by Sasha Yevtushenko, and starring Paul Courtenay Hyu as Shin and Liz Sutherland as Choi.[27]\n\n## Works\n\n### Filmography\n\nPartial filmography as director:\n\n- A Flower in Hell (1958)\n- To the Last Day (1960)\n- Prince Yeonsan (1961)\n- Seong Chun-hyang (1961)\n- The Houseguest and My Mother (1961)\n- The Memorial Gate for Virtuous Women (1962)\n- Rice (1963)\n- Red Scarf (1964)\n- Deaf Sam-yong (1964)\n- Phantom Queen (1967)\n- Prince Daewon (1968)\n- Ghosts of Chosun (1970)\n- A Woman with Half Soul (1973)\n- The Three-Day Reign (1973)\n- At 13 Years Old (1974)\n- An Emissary of No Return (1984)[28]\n- Runaway (1984)[29]\n- Love, Love, My Love (1985)[30]\n- Salt (1985)[31]\n- The Tale of Shim Chong (1985)[32]\n- Pulgasari (1985)[33]\n- Breakwater (1985)[34]\n- Mayumi (1990)[35]\n- Vanished (1994)\n- 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up (1995)\n\n### Executive producer\n\n- Galgameth (1996)\n\n### Bibliography\n\n- Shin Sang-ok (2007).

United Nations Human Rights Council: 288–289 (Paragraph 905). Archived from the original on February 27, 2014. In 1978, South Korean Actress Ms Choi Un-hee was abducted from Hong Kong after travelling there to meet people in the movie industry. After being forced onto a boat by DPRK agents, Ms Choi demanded an explanation from the abductors, to which they replied \"Madam Choi, we are now going to the bosom of General Kim Il-sung\".  On her arrival in the DPRK on 22 January, she was met by Kim Jong-il who took her on a tour of Pyongyang.  Upon learning of her disappearance, Ms Choi's ex-husband Shin Sang-ok, a leading filmmaker, went to Hong Kong to look for her. He was also abducted from Hong Kong by the same DPRK agent in July 1978.  Kim Jong-il said to Mr Shin upon his arrival in the DPRK \"I had ordered the operations group to carry out a project to bring you here as I wanted a talented director like you to be in the North.\"  This information is consistent with the accounts from former DPRK officials who were personally involved in abductions who indicated that Kim Jong-il personally signed off on abduction orders.  During their time in the DPRK, Mr Shin Sang-ok and Ms Choi Un-hee were involved in a number of DPRK-produced movies of which Kim Jong-il was the executive producer. The couple escaped into the United States Embassy while visiting a film festival in Vienna in 1986. They later settled in the United States; Mr Shin has since passed away. {{cite journal}}: Cite journal requires |journal= (help)\n- ^ Obituary The Economist, April 27, 2006\n- ^ Paul Fischer (2015).

Passionately committed to making and teaching film throughout his career, Yu took a decidedly intellectual approach to cinema which at times left him out of favor in an industry dominated by Korea's military government and commercially-oriented producers. Although often described as Korea's foremost practitioner of cinematic realism, a closer look at his work reveals an eclectic mix of styles and approaches that defy easy definition.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Filmography\n\nMommy, Star, and Sea Anemone (1995)\n\nSon of Man (1980)\n\nRainy Days (1979)\n\nThe Gate (1977)\n\nFlame (1975)\n\nBun-Rye's Story (1971)\n\nI Would Like to Become a Human (1969)\n\nSchool Excursion (1969)\n\nArirang (1968)\n\nDescendent of Cain (1968)\n\nThree Henpeck Generations (1967)\n\nGuests Who Came by the Last Train (1967)\n\nMartyr (1965)\n\nDaughters of Pharmacist Kim (1963)\n\nObaltan (\"The Aimless Bullet\") (1961)\n\nEven the Clouds Are Drifting (1959)\n\nThe Lost Youth (1957)\n\nThe Crossroad (1956)\n\n\n\n(Link to complete filmography coming soon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiography\n\n\n\n     Yu Hyun-mok was born on July 2, 1925 in Hwanghae Province, in what is now North Korea.  He moved to Seoul in 1939, and after entering Dongduk University as a Korean Language major, he decided to become a playwright after seeing the plays of Yu Chi-jin and Lee Hae-rang.  His first experience in the film industry was as an assistant director for Cho Jung-ho in 1946.  The following year he directed and starred in a 45-minute film called Sea Dragon, and instituted a \"Film Art Organization\" which was the first film group in a major Korean university.  In 1949 he graduated from university and assisted on Shin Sang-ok's debut feature Evil Night.\n     Yu made his directorial debut with The Crossroad in 1956.  Two years later, in 1958, he would marry visual artist Park Keun-ja, whom he has credited with having a strong impression on his work.  Yu's most famous film Obaltan was shot in 1960 and screened the following year.  It was invited to the 7th San Francisco Film Festival in 1963, and Yu attended the event together with actor Kim Jin-gyu.\n     Yu continued making a considerable number of films throughout the 1960s (though not near the number of some of his contemporaries), while also teaching at Dongguk University from 1963.  His first film as an independent producer was Martyr (1965), which also became the first Korean film ever to be exported to the U.S.  That same year, Yu was arrested for violation of the Anti-Communist Law, but was later pronounced innocent.  In 1967, Yu participated in Korea's first omnibus film, titled A Regret.  In 1971 he established his own production company, Yu Productions.\n     Apart from his filmmaking, Yu remained active in the film community in a number of different roles.  He formed the Korea Amateur Filmmakers Association in 1970, was elected chairman of the Korean Directors' Association in 1974, was elected as vice president of the Motion Pictures Association of Korea in 1975, and was appointed a full professor at Dongguk University in 1976.  In 1977 he was elected director of the Korean Film Archive, and then he organized the East-West Film Group in 1979.  He was elected chairman of the Film Art Society of Korea in 1989, and then became Dean of the Department of Arts at Dongguk University.  The following year he officially retired at the age of 65, but continued to teach as an honorary professor.\n     Yu also published several books: The Development of Korean Cinema in 1980, Theory of International Film Directors in 1984, and he also wrote the cinema portion of the book History of Korean Theatre, Dance, and Cinema in 1984.  Later he would write Critical Essays on Film Studies in 1990 and My Life: Yu Hyun-mok in 1995. \n     Yu directed his last film, Mommy, Star, and Sea Anemone in 1995.  His work has been the subject of several retrospectives in the 1990s, including at the Korean Film Archive in 1990, in Aix-en-Provence, France in 1999, and at the 4th Pusan International Film Festival in 1999.  In addition, his works were presented along with that of Shin Sang-ok and Im Kwon-taek in a special film series \"Three Master Korean Filmmakers\" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1996.\n\n\n\n\nEssays and Thoughts\nSchool Excursion (1969)\n\nby Darcy Paquet\n\n\n\n\nAwards and Honors\n\n\nHonorary Director Award - 33rd Grand Bell Awards in 1995\n\nPresented with an Order of Cultural Merit from the Korean government, 1988\n\nBest Picture, Flame (1975) - 14th Grand Bell Awards\n\nBest Director, Bun-Rye's Story (1971) - 10th Grand Bell Awards\n\nBest Picture/Best Director, Descendent of Cain (1968) - 6th Blue Dragon Film Awards\n\n\n\n\nLinks and Printed Sources\n\nCho, Eunsun. \"The Stray Bullet and the Crisis of Korean Masculinity.\"  In McHugh, Kathleen and Abelmann, Nancy, ed.\n South Korean Golden Age Melodrama: Gender, Genre, and National Cinema.\n Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2005.\n\n\n\nLee, Yong-kwan, and San-yong Lee, eds.

Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In  1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade.\n\nKim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in The Housemaid (1960), which featured a powerful femme fatale character. It is widely considered one of the best Korean films of all time.[2] After a \"Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low-point in the history of Korean cinema because of government censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as Insect Woman (1972) and Iodo (1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had declined, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. He was preparing a comeback film when he and his wife were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cinémathèque screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki-young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang-soo, Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook, claim Kim Ki-young as an influence on their careers.\n\n## Biography\n\n### Early life\n\nKim Ki-young was born in the Gyo-dong neighborhood of Seoul—now part of Gyeongun-dong in Jongno-gu[3]—on October 10, 1922.[1][4] His family had lived in Seoul for several generations, and his grandfather was a guard at Gwanghwamun.[5] Kim's family was well-educated and artistically inclined. His father, Kim Seok-jin, was an English teacher, and his mother, Han Jin-cho, was also a teacher and a graduate of Gyeonggi Women's College. Both painted as a hobby.[5] The family had two daughters, and Kim Ki-young was their only son. One of his sisters graduated as an art major from Seoul National University, and the other majored in dance at Ewha Womans University. His sister's encouraged the young Kim to develop his own creativity.[6] The family moved to Pyongyang in 1930, where they stayed for the next 10 years.[5] At Pyongyang National High School, Kim showed exceptional talent in music, painting and writing, and his studious nature earned him the nickname \"Professor of Physics\".[7] While still a student, one of Kim's poems was published in a Japanese newspaper, and he was awarded first prize in a painting competition.[8]\n\nDespite his artistic talents, Kim's main interest was medicine, and he applied for entrance into medical school upon graduation from high school in 1940.[5] When he failed to gain admittance, Kim moved to Japan, planning to study and save up money to reapply for medical school.[9] The theater and cinema grew into lifetime interests at this time. Kim often went to Kyoto, where he attended many stage productions and saw many international films. Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930) and Fritz Lang's M (1931) made a particularly strong impression on him, and their influence was to show in his mature film style.[6]\n\nKim returned to Korea in 1941, initially planning to work as a dentist, but instead immersing himself in the study of drama. At this time he was particularly interested in classical Greek theater, Ibsen and Eugene O'Neill.[10] To avoid conscription by the Japanese into the military, Kim returned to Japan briefly before 1945.[5] He returned to Pyongyang where he studied Stanislavsky's theories of acting[11] and founded a theatrical group called \"The Little Orchid\".[6] In 1946 Kim enrolled in Seoul Medical School, Seoul National University, and graduated with a major in dentistry in 1950. While attending university, his theatrical activities continued. He founded the National University Theater in 1949, and with this group staged many works of the Western theater, including Ibsen's Ghosts, Čapek's Robots, Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, and works by Chekhov and O'Neill. The main actress Kim worked with while at the university was Kim Yu-bong, who would later become his wife.[12]\n\n### Film career\n\nKim was an intern at Seoul University Medical Clinic when the Korean War broke out. He went to Pusan on June 1, 1951, the day the North Korean army retreated.[12] In Pusan, Kim met Oh Young-jin, a fellow Pyongyang National High School graduate. Oh, who would later write the screenplay to the popular film The Wedding Day (1956), was producing newsreels for the Korean News through the Bureau of Public Information, and helped Kim get a job writing screenplays with this organization. With Oh's help, Kim got a job working for the United States Information Service in Jinhae.[12] The job helped shape Kim's life in several ways. With the increase in pay he received from the U.S.I.S., he was able to marry Kim Yu-bong in 1951,[6] and their first son, Kim Dong-won, was born in 1952. They would have a daughter born in 1955 and a second son, Kim Dong-yang, born in 1958.[5] The two remained married for the rest of their lives. Kim Yu-bong supported her husband's filmmaking career through her dental practice, giving him a unique degree of independence among Korean filmmakers of his era to pursue his own personal visions. At a career retrospective during the last year of his life, Kim commented, \"My wife's support has been unflagging over the years, even if, at times, she has seen one of my films and cried 'What have you done with my money?' But at rare moments like this retrospective, she becomes very emotional, recognizing that finally it has all been worthwhile.\"[13]\n\nKim filmed about 20 documentaries for the U.S.I.S. with such titles as Diary of the Navy and I Am a Truck for \"Liberty  News\".[6][10] The latter title was given an award by the U.S. State Department.[12] The training and equipment Kim gained while working on these propaganda newsreels for the U.S.I.S. also enabled him to direct his first commercial film, Box of Death (1955).[6] Kim used expired film stock and a manually operated camera from the U.S.I.S. to make this debut feature, an anti-communist melodrama about war orphans.[14] The film, now lost, showed stylistic influences from the Italian neo-realists and was the first Korean film to employ synchronous sound.[6][15]\n\nTheatrical poster to Yangsan Province (1955).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the success of this first film, Kim was able to direct his second feature, the historical costume drama Yangsan Province (also 1955), again using primitive equipment obtained from the U.S.I.S. Although Kim claimed to have based the film on a traditional song he learned from his mother, no exact source for the story has been found. It is suspected that the director made up the story himself, modeling it on traditional stories such as Chunhyangjeon, Lee Kyu-hwan's remake of which had recently become a major success, stimulating a rebirth in Korean cinema.[16] After Lee's Chunhyangjeon, Yangsan Province was the second most successful Korean film of 1955.[17] Though a popular success, critics of the time were not kind to Yangsan Province. Yoo Do-yeon called the film a \"work of bad taste,\" and Heo Baek-nyeon said that it \"debases the dignity of Korean cinema.\"[15] As his only surviving film of the 1950s, Yangsan Province sheds considerable light on Kim Ki-young's early career.[18] In an era in which Korean film critics considered realism to be important, the now-lost ending to Yangsan Province, in which two dead lovers ascend to heaven on a beam of light, was harshly criticized. In light of Kim's later career, critics today believe that this cut scene displays some of the most recognizable characteristics of Kim's mature style such as an interest in the fantastic, and a jarring blending of genres.[15][19] Other motifs that were to be explored in depth in Kim's later work can also be found in Yangsan Province, such as animal imagery, particularly the use of hens as a representation of fertility and sexuality.[20]\n\nIn 1956 Kim started Kim Ki-young Productions,[5] and began making melodramas, the most popular film genre in South Korea at the time.[6] His first independent production was Touch-Me-Not (1956). In 1957, Kim was living near the red-light district of Yongsan, and the atmosphere of this neighborhood influenced his films, A Woman's War and Twilight Train (both 1957).[5] With First Snow (1958), Kim moved from melodrama to a more socially conscious realism. Defiance of a Teenager (1959) and Sad Pastorale (1960) followed in this style.[12] Defiance of a Teenager was one of Kim's most successful and respected early works, and he attended the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1960 for a showing of this film.[21]\n\n### The Housemaid\n\n1960 was a critical year for South Korea, marking the end of the rule of Syngman Rhee through the civilian April Revolution. In 1962, another military authoritarian, General Park Chung-Hee, would ascend to power and rule South Korea for nearly two decades. The short period of relative freedom between these two administrations was known as the Second Republic. During this time, filmmakers took advantage of the relaxation of governmental control over the film industry to create several boldly experimental works. Director Yu Hyun-mok's film Aimless Bullet (1960) dates from this period, as does Kim Ki-young's major breakthrough, The Housemaid (also 1960).[22] A lurid, expressionistic melodrama set in an eerie house, involving sexual obsessions, murder and rats, this is the first film in which Kim's mature style is fully evident, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Korean films ever made.[2][6]\n\nThe film is a domestic thriller telling of a family's destruction by the introduction of a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-storey house with his wife and two children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing could happen to anyone.[2][23][24]\n\nThe Housemaid marked Kim's full break with realism, the main style of Korean cinema at the time, into his own version of expressionism.[12] The plot, themes and even character names set out in The Housemaid were to be revisited by Kim repeatedly in his later career. Besides the first film, the official \"Housemaid Trilogy\" consists of Woman of Fire (1971) and Woman of Fire '82 (1982).[25] Also, at least two other later films—Insect Woman (1972) and Beasts of Prey (1985)—are, in some ways, remakes of The Housemaid. By using the story as a template, Kim was able to emphasize different aspects of the scenario, and to concentrate on different details and aspects of the central situation with each new re-telling.[13]\n\n### Mid-career\n\nKim solidified his break with cinematic realism by following The Housemaid with two more films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time.[12] The Sea Knows (1961) transcended its roots in the standard anti-Japanese World War II film to become a distinctive examination of humanity, sadism, greed, lust for power and sexuality.[26] The box-office success of this film enabled Kim to buy his first house, in the Namsan district of Seoul.[9] Goryeojang (1963), dealt with a similar subject matter as The Ballad of Narayama (1983), directed by Shohei Imamura, a filmmaker with whom Kim has often been compared.[13] Kim's version of the story is marked by his mixing of genres. For example, he frames the story—which deals with an ancient tradition in which elders were abandoned to die—within a modern lecture on birth control.[27]\n\nSome of the characteristic traits of Kim's mature style, first seen in these three films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality.[28] Although in stark contrast to the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal with the realities of postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.[29]\n\nDuring the 1970s, South Korea's film industry was at a low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local film industry, cinema attendance in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s.[30] Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce some of his most innovative and personal works at this time.[31] Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy.[29] The use of color, particularly reds and blues to express the anxiety and desires of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaid's dark, shadowy black-and-white photography.[32] For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges.[33][34] Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.[35][36]\n\nAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored.[10] The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters.[10] Kim later commented, \"North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes.\"[13]\n\nFilm professor and programmer for the Pusan International Film Festival, Lee Yong-kwan calls Iodo (1977) Kim's best film,[15] and Variety's Seoul-correspondent Darcy Paquet calls it \"one of Korean cinema's most compelling, unnerving depictions of the primal forces that motivate humankind.\"[38][39] An examination of environmental, religious, social and sexual taboos, the film culminates in a scene of necrophilia that Paquet calls \"one of the most shocking, brazen sequences ever shot by a Korean filmmaker\".[38]\n\n### Rediscovery and later life\n\nKim's associates characterize the director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way of writing a screenplay was to walk away from home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen to neighborhood gossip, and write all night in the dark.[40] South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's shoes were never shined, and that one of his few material pleasures was gourmet coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry.[41] The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.[8]\n\nNevertheless, since the early 1960s, Kim Ki-young's status as one of the greatest and most original Korean film directors had never been in doubt. His stylistic preoccupation with sexuality, horror and melodrama had earned Kim the nickname, \"Mister Monster\" from his admirers.[42] However, by the 1980s Kim's career had fallen into neglect. His continued fascination with B-movie exploitation themes as well as the increasingly obsessive and subversive nature of his films resulted in his isolation from the film community, and in financial failures at the box-office. The last of the Housemaid trilogy, Woman of Fire '82 (1982) is an even more radicalized and baroque retelling of the same basic story he had filmed numerous times in the previous two decades.[10] By the mid-1980s, Kim's film output had slowed and finally stopped.\n\nIn the early 1990s Kim's work began to be rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who discussed his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. Noticing this growing domestic Kim Ki-young cult, the Dongsung Cinematheque, an art-house theater in Seoul, programmed a retrospective showing of Kim's films.[43] With his profile again high in Korean film society, Kim's work began to attract international attention. Five of his films were screened at the Tokyo International Film Festival in 1996.[40] When Kim Ki-young's career was highlighted at the second Pusan International Film Festival in 1997, his work found enthusiastic new audiences in the international film community. The strongly positive reception of Kim's work by international audiences surprised the festival organizers, who immediately began receiving requests for overseas retrospectives of Kim's career.[44] With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled Diabolical Woman.[13] The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing of his films in 1998.[45] Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, he and his wife were killed in a house fire caused by an electrical short circuit[9] on February 5, 1998.[8]\n\nKim Ki-young's death did not stop the revival of interest in his films. A six-film retrospective of Kim's career was shown in San Francisco twice in 1998.[13] Within the year, Kim's films were screened at the Belgrade International Film Festival, the London Pan-Asian Film Festival, the Estate Romana and the Paris Videothèque.[46] Few prints of Korean films before the 1970s survive, and at one  point 90% of Kim's output was considered lost.[10] Under the \"Kim Ki-young Renaissance Project\", the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) has worked to find Kim's lost films and to restore those that are damaged.[40] In 2006, the French Cinémathèque presented 18 of Kim's films, many of them newly rediscovered and restored through the efforts of the KOFIC.[10]\n\nDuring his lifetime, Kim gained many supporters among the younger generation of South Korean directors. Park Kwang-su reportedly admires Kim Ki-young above all other directors,[44] and Lee Chang-ho is another of Kim's followers.[40] In the years since his death, Kim's influence on Korean cinema has continued to be seen through the work of the current generation of South Korean filmmakers, including such prominent directors as Im Sang-soo and Kim Ki-duk.[10] Bong Joon-ho calls Kim his mentor and favorite director.[47] Park Chan-wook names The Housemaid as one of the films which most influenced his career, and says of Kim Ki-young, \"He is able to find and portray beauty in destruction, humor in violence and terror.\"[48]\n\n## Filmography\n\n| Film title[49]               | Cast                             | Notes[50]

            "spanned_content": "<movieRecommendation>\n    <Name>Kim Ki-young</Name>\n    <Director>Kim Ki-young</Director>\n    <AdditionalInformation>\n        Kim Ki-young (Korean: 김기영; October 10, 1919 – February 5, 1998) was a <Genre>South Korean</Genre> film director, known for his intensely psychosexual and melodramatic horror films, often focusing on the psychology of their female characters. Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipment to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films, Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade.\n\n        Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in <Name>The Housemaid</Name> (1960), which featured a powerful femme fatale character. It is widely considered one of the best Korean films of all time. After a \"Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low point in the history of Korean cinema because of government censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as <Name>Insect Woman</Name> (1972) and <Name>Iodo</Name> (1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release and with their rediscovery years later. By the 1980s, Kim's popularity had declined, and his output decreased in the second half of the decade. Neglected by the mainstream during much of the 1990s, Kim became a cult figure in South Korean film Internet forums in the early 1990s. Widespread international interest in his work was stimulated by a career retrospective at the 1997 Pusan International Film Festival. He was preparing a comeback film when he and his wife were killed in a house fire in 1998. The Berlin International Film Festival gave Kim a posthumous retrospective in 1998, and the French Cinémathèque screened 18 of Kim's films, some newly rediscovered and restored, in 2006. Through the efforts of the Korean Film Council (KOFIC), previously lost films by Kim Ki-young continue to be rediscovered and restored. Many current prominent South Korean filmmakers, including directors Im Sang-soo, Bong Joon-ho, and Park Chan-wook, claim Kim Ki-young as an influence on their careers.\n\n        <Name>The Housemaid</Name> (1960) was a critical year for South Korea, marking the end of the rule of Syngman Rhee through the civilian April Revolution. A lurid, expressionistic melodrama set in an eerie house, involving sexual obsessions, murder, and rats, this is the first film in which Kim's mature style is fully evident, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Korean films ever made. The film is a domestic thriller telling of a family's destruction by the introduction of a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing that could happen to anyone.\n\n        Kim solidified his break with cinematic realism by following <Name>The Housemaid</Name> with two more films exploring styles and mixing genres, radically new for Korean cinema at the time. Some of the characteristic traits of Kim's mature style, first seen in these three films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions, and sexuality. Although in stark contrast to the realism, harmony, balance, and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal with the realities of postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology.\n\n        Kim's associates characterize the director as an eccentric individual. His stylistic preoccupation with sexuality, horror, and melodrama had earned Kim the nickname, \"Mister Monster\" from his admirers. However, by the 1980s, Kim's career had fallen into neglect. His continued fascination with B-movie exploitation themes as well as the increasingly obsessive and subversive nature of his films resulted in his isolation from the film community, and in financial failures at the box office. The last of the Housemaid trilogy, <Name>Woman of Fire '82</Name> (1982) is an even more radicalized and baroque retelling of the same basic story he had filmed numerous times in the previous two decades. \n\n        In the early 1990s, Kim's work began to be rediscovered by South Korean cult film fans who discussed his films through the Internet and exchanged hard-to-find copies by videotape. With this renewed interest, Kim began work on a comeback film to be titled <Name>Diabolical Woman</Name>. The Berlin International Film Festival invited him to attend a showing of his films in 1998. Before Kim started work on the film or attended the festival, he and his wife were killed in a house fire caused by an electrical short circuit on February 5, 1998. \n\n        Kim Ki-young's death did not stop the revival of interest in his films. A six-film retrospective of Kim's career was shown in San Francisco twice in 1998. Under the \"Kim Ki-young Renaissance Project\", the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) has worked to find Kim's lost films and to restore those that are damaged. In 2006, the French Cinémathèque presented 18 of Kim's films, many of them newly rediscovered and restored through the efforts of the KOFIC. \n    </AdditionalInformation>\n</movieRecommendation>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have tagged the relevant sections according to the attributes specified in the ADT.

His protagonists belong to a particular milieu, which happens to be his: they work in the arts, usually in film, sometimes as novelists or painters. They are maladroit, at times in professional settings, always in personal matters. His plots revolve around romantic anguish and complication. Failures of communication abound. Characters are driven by libidinal urges and petty vanity. Action tends to be displaced to the realm of talk. Awkward conversations unfold over many drinks, alcohol serving as disinhibitor and spur to philosophical rumination. No one ever learns from their mistakes. But to accuse Hong of repeating himself misses the point. Repetition in his films is both subject and structuring device, and, like any artist who works with this formal strategy, Hong finds meaning in the subtlest variations, coaxing compelling moral dramas from prosaic scenarios.\n\nHong’s other distinguishing trait is that he works very quickly. He has directed twenty-seven features in twenty-six years—an almost unheard-of pace in contemporary cinema—and, at age sixty-one, he shows no sign of slowing down. Quite the opposite: the last nine years account for half of his filmography, and it is not unusual for him to première two movies a year. Hong has achieved abundance through a radical reduction of means. He funds each movie with the proceeds of his previous films, and he makes his films as he goes. After selecting actors and locations, he enters production without a script; every morning, he writes the scenes on the docket for that day or the next. Since he uses much of what he shoots, he can edit an entire feature in as little as a day or two. This modest and pragmatic approach produces works of paradoxical complexity, notable for their breezy irreverence and their emotional and philosophical depth.\n\nHaving programmed Hong’s films in New York for more than a decade, I have seen his audience grow exponentially, to the point that he has attained something resembling cult status, not least among younger cinephiles and filmmakers. I suspect this is partly because his way of working is about as close as the industrial medium of cinema can get these days to true independence: no other major filmmaker has liberated himself as fully from the strictures of time and money. Hong and his partner, the actress Kim Min-hee, with whom he first worked on the 2015 film “Right Now, Wrong Then,” travelled to New York this month for a complete retrospective of his feature films that I organized at Film at Lincoln Center, where Hong appeared for four nights of discussions. The week was not without its plot twists: Hong arrived from Seoul complaining of intense pain in his cheek, which we first assumed was a nerve issue that could be alleviated with acupuncture. It eventually became clear that he had an infected tooth that needed to be extracted, an ordeal which required him to soldier through one Q. &amp; A. with a puffy, Novocained face. (Given his tendency to repurpose aspects of his own life as raw material, I would not be surprised to see some version of this medical adventure make its way into a future film.) The following conversation was condensed from the retrospective’s concluding talk and has been edited for clarity.\n\nYou’ve taught film for many years, and we see filmmakers who are also teachers in your movies. I’m wondering what teaching means to you. Do you enjoy it? How does it relate to your practice as a filmmaker?\n\nI teach for money. [Audience laughs.] When I went into the classroom, I used to recite a mantra: they are here to hear something from me, and I have to do my best. From the beginning, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to make a film that could support me economically. I needed a second job. It was quite easy and ideal for me to have a teaching position at a university. I also enjoy being with much younger people. In my classroom these days, the students are twenty-one, twenty-five, twenty-eight. The way I teach, I listen to their own stories—that’s the good part.\n\nWhat’s the bad part?\n\nYou know—life. Life has many different aspects.\n\nHow long have you been teaching? Did you take breaks?\n\nI took a long break. I got fed up, so I quit. After four, five years, I needed money. Luckily, somebody offered me a job.\n\nNow you teach at Konkuk, a private university in Seoul. Is it filmmaking classes?\n\nAnimation and filmmaking together, in one department.\n\nCould you give us a sense of how a class works? You told me the other night that you never show your students any films.\n\nMy films?\n\nNo, any films. Or do you show them some films?\n\nI just don’t like to.\n\nSo they don’t watch any films in your class?\n\nI tell them, “I want you to be sincere about making films. And work with true interest. If you find true interest, then you can overcome stupid temptations to copy something or to boast.” I let them write something, read it in front of people, comment on what their classmates said, and then I let them finish and shoot it. That’s all I do.\n\nDo your students ever emulate your very particular way of working? I was talking to a Columbia student who said that he has changed his way of working now because of your process—he doesn’t write scripts until he finds people and places. Are your students encouraged to work this way?\n\nIn the classroom, I usually don’t like talking about my films. Sometimes it comes out naturally, but I never encourage it. That way of working comes from my temperament. I didn’t plan it this way. I just had this strong urge to go in this direction. I don’t know if it can be beneficial or right for students. But I’m kind of an old person now. I’ve made some films—they can look at my films and they can try.\n\nSo your idea is that every student should find their own method, based on—\n\nI don’t think we have to worry about things like that. Because, if you are a born artist, you don’t have to worry about anything.\n\nHow do you know if you’re born—\n\nJust by looking at him. He’s working on something. He never doubts. Just doing something all the time. He never stops.\n\nTwo young actors you’ve worked with recently, Shin Seok-ho and Park Mi-so, are former students. They’re the leads in “Introduction.” I read an interview where Shin Seok-ho said he thought he was a crew member until you introduced him to the cast as an actor. And he didn’t realize until after the shoot ended that he was the lead actor.\n\nThat’s kind of true. He used to work as a production person. I got to know him a little better and then, one day, I wanted to use him as an actor. Why I choose a certain person is very, very complicated—I can never generalize. I don’t want to work with someone who has qualities I cannot bear. In the beginning of my filmmaking, I was trying to put up with certain . . .\n\nActors, you mean? Like, egos?\n\nThere are just certain things that I don’t want to see. At that time, I thought I had to endure and find the good things, and that’s what I did. As time passed, more and more I wanted to work with people who have good qualities from my point of view, even if they don’t really understand what they’re doing in the film. When I look at them later, in a different setting, their interviews, I don’t want to feel like I shouldn’t have worked with them.\n\nHow was it that Shin Seok-ho didn’t realize that he was the lead actor until after the film ended?\n\nBecause of the way I work. I finish a day of shooting, and then I think about the next day based on what I shot. With “Introduction,” even more so.\n\nBecause it was a three-part film.\n\nUsually, when I cast, I know who the main character will be. In this case, I didn’t know. I was just working on the first part, which, luckily, ends with the snow falling. I thought it could be just a short film and left it there. When I went to the Berlin Film Festival, the thought came up, Maybe I can bring him there and shoot something. They said O.K., and we shot for three days. After that, I knew I had to enlarge it into a feature-length film.\n\nShin Seok-ho also said that, in class, you would reprimand the students who would try to “fake movies.” What does it mean to fake a movie, and how do you know when an impulse is sincere or fake?\n\nIt’s very easy. You just keep asking two or three questions. Eventually, they admit that it’s fake. Everyone can get to the conclusion by asking about it seriously. Then they know they’re faking it. They’re not working with what I call true interest.\n\nWhen did you find your true interest?\n\nAdolescence. I said to myself, I would rather die.\n\nThan what?\n\nThan doing something fake.\n\nDo you remember what you were like as a student?\n\nI don’t know. I never really think about my past very seriously. But some people from my college years—they said I was crazy. Then they gave me some examples that I don’t remember. They said I shaved my head one day, all of a sudden. I don’t remember that.\n\nYour parents had a film-production company. I’m wondering if getting into film was something that you thought about at an early age. You didn’t study film to begin with.\n\nI think it’s what they call accidents. I didn’t take my entrance exam when I was nineteen, twenty. I was just goofing around. One day, this guy, who is quite a famous theatre-play director, came to our place because of my mother. He got drunk; I had to clean up the mess. I kind of liked him because he was a crazy guy. I was sitting beside him, and he said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I am doing nothing.” He said, “I think you would be good for theatre.” He left and I thought about it and it sounded very interesting. I felt maybe I could do it.\n\nSo I went into the theatre department. Then I had a fight with a senior student. The atmosphere there then was like the military, especially that department. It was very strict. You could never disobey orders. Their justification was always: you have to unite, you have to get rid of the ego. So they did all kinds of strange things. One day, this student asked me to do something, and I said no in front of everyone. He got so pissed off, and we had a really terrible scene. So I knew I had to quit the school.\n\nAnd then I thought I could go into filmmaking because it was the same department. I had this feeling that maybe filmmaking was deeper. What I mean is that, even though you keep digging and digging, you will never see the bottom. That’s how I started filmmaking. So it’s an accident—maybe an accident caused by providence.\n\nAfter studying film in Korea, you decided to study in the U.S.—at the California College of Arts and Crafts and then at the Art Institute of Chicago, which are both art schools that have film departments and are interdisciplinary in their approach. How did you end up in the Bay Area and then in Chicago?\n\nAnother accident, but a lucky one, looking back. I didn’t know I wanted to get out of that country at that time. Then I saw this very small article that said, “Even though you didn’t finish military service, you can still go abroad to study and come back and do it later.” There was a change of the law. That same day, I went to this company that helps with college applications. I went there without telling my mother or anyone, and asked them to help me get admission to any U.S. school around [a specific] area.\n\nYou picked California?\n\nProbably, and some other place, too. The important thing was that it was the fastest one. Conditional admission was fine, too; I could do some English work there and start regular classes later. I was very impulsive.\n\nIt was in Chicago that you had your encounter with Cézanne and his apple paintings, which you’ve described as a kind of lightning-bolt moment.\n\nI’m grateful for the place, because that’s where I met Cézanne, who, for me, was the greatest. I saw this apple painting [“The Plate of Apples”] for the first time in an art museum. I was a student, so I had a free pass. I was standing there talking to myself, like, “This is enough. I don’t need anything more. It still is the greatest.” I didn’t analyze it, but, naturally, I ask myself: why? Maybe his way of proportionalizing the abstract and the concrete is just right for me. I think that’s why, when I see his paintings, I never get bored. I can keep looking at them. They’re very fresh all the time. With other artists, I get bored as soon as I can see their point of view, their intention, their style—O.K., it’s good, but that’s it. But, for me, Cézanne is different—always fresh, always something more.\n\nI like that you identify this as the defining quality, because I find it in your work, this balance between the concrete and the abstract. Are there filmmakers who you feel achieve that?\n\nI don’t think I found this similar line of division or proportion. I have a number of directors whom I really love, but they are different.\n\nIn a way, Bresson’s films also have something quite material and quite intangible.\n\nI could give a long talk about Bresson, Jean Renoir, [Éric] Rohmer, even John Ford. Luis Buñuel, I like him very much. I cannot generalize. There are directors I just love, and that has never changed.\n\nThese are directors you discovered in your twenties?\n\nUntil I got to the Art Institute, in Chicago, I was not in a normal state. I think I was too emotional; my mind was not clear enough to start so-called studying. When I was in Chicago, I suddenly felt very clear; my mind was clear, and then I saw the Cézanne painting and I also saw Robert Bresson’s “Diary of a Country Priest.” When I saw it, I was so happy, because it’s kind of a narrative film, but it reaches a certain level that I had never experienced. That gave me real encouragement—O.K., maybe I can make a film with a narrative.\n\nAnd, before that, you were not making narrative films.\n\nI was making very strange short films.\n\nI read that your thesis film was called “Beef.” You don’t show these films anymore.\n\nI had to shoot something and came to the idea of this woman eating steak in a sunny apartment, which was mine. I asked the school art department if I could hire a nude model, because I want her to eat steak naked. The school gave me a number and I called and made an appointment. She was from Israel. I met her, and we were on the way to my apartment, and I explained, “You are going to eat steak,” and she said, “I’m a vegetarian.” [Audience laughs.] So we stopped by the market and I bought her an apple. I explained, “Tell me about your experience that made you a vegetarian.” She was naked and holding the red apple, kind of smiling, talking about this episode. All the time my camera movement is very close-up, so her body looks like flesh. And then she bites the apple and smiles. The students who saw it didn’t like it. Some female students yelled at me.\n\nYou kept the title “Beef,” even though she was eating an apple.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve thought about that. I never thought about changing the title. Maybe this is the reason some female students didn’t like it.\n\nStudying in the U.S. was not that common for Korean filmmakers of your generation. Do you think of this as an important experience? Cross-cultural contact and miscommunication are important in some of your films. I think of “Night and Day” or “In Another Country.”\n\nOne of the most important elements of my being abroad was that, for the first time, I felt comfortable. Since I was quite young, I didn’t feel comfortable with many things. That’s why I started drinking heavily and smoking heavily and all kinds of crazy stuff when I was very young. In California, it was green grass all around, very nice weather. It was so nice. I think that’s the biggest thing for me—just being away, feeling kind of free, even though inside you’re not free, as you know. Only years later, I had a clearer mind and I found Cézanne and Bresson.\n\nIn early interviews you said that, for many years, you carried around Bresson’s “Notes on the Cinematograph.” Is that a book you still think about?\n\nNot really, but, for five years, I actually had that book with me all the time. That book doesn’t start from the conventions of cinema. It starts from his own honest look at the medium. His conclusions, sometimes, I don’t agree with. But his attitude of asking questions about film is so nice.\n\nYour films are different, but many of his ideas are relevant to your practice. The book is so much about making do with what is available. One of my favorite lines is when he advises filmmakers to avoid big subjects: “Avoid subjects that are too vast or too remote, in which nothing warns you when you are going astray.”\n\nI like that sentence. Great book. Also [Luis] Buñuel’s autobiography, Jean Renoir’s autobiography—great in different ways.\n\nWould you write a book?\n\nNo. Not right now, anyway.\n\nTwo nights in a row, we had questions from the audience about reality as you see it, as it relates to your films. The first night, you talked about how reality is a concept that covers your eyes. The second night, someone asked about reality again, and you talked about how two people can never agree on what reality is. It made me think of a quote of yours from nearly twenty years ago: “People tell me that I make films about reality. They’re wrong. I make films based on structures that I have thought up.” Does that still apply today?\n\nAbout structures, I would say that differently, but, about reality, yes, still. Should I talk about reality?\n\nBy all means.\n\nIf two people talk for a hundred years about very small things and can never be sure what is happening inside the other person, that means it’s impossible to have a concept such as reality that’s a valid one. It’s a word we made up out of some necessity; sometimes it’s very convenient because we feel we are in community, we are understanding. On a practical level, we need that. But reality is a different thing. Life, phenomena, whatever—it’s always a billion times more complex and mysterious than anything we come up with in a logical sentence. It’s impossible to capture what is going on. Even if I want to describe what I feel right now, ten seconds of my experience, it will take billions of years. One person can never describe, so-called objectively, one reality. So we just use the word for convenience. But, once you get rid of it, it’s very comfortable. Like the word “consistency”—I don’t know what it is. I’ve never been consistent. All my life, people said I should be consistent. Who said that being consistent is good? I don’t think it’s good, nor is it possible.\n\nThere are so many words that trap us. They are like very small, tiny dots, and, if you place them on the center of your eyes, in a few seconds, the whole universe is in that dot. You lose the senses—that’s why we become so stupid so soon. It’s all just this concept. It’s small dots sticking to your eyes. Millions of dots waiting to crawl onto your eyes.\n\nHow is your approach to structure different today?\n\nIn the middle of making a film, or sometimes in the beginning, I become conscious of structure. Structure is an important aspect to look at. But I know these days the first thing is the person and the place. For lack of a better word, it’s just instinct or intuition. I just want to go there and shoot something, I just want to work with this person, this actor. If that’s settled, then I concentrate my energy on thinking of some ideas—just enough so that I can start the first day of shooting. I have four places, three places, I try my best to work on them, and I have maybe three or four people. So I work with just these two elements. Structure comes later, naturally.\n\nGiven the importance of structure to you, do you draw when you write? Your films invite us to think about them as shapes or as diagrams.\n\nWhen I start writing a script, I just write, but doodling—I do that very often. Some of my friends have said, “You’re a drawing person.” When I explain my thoughts, the easiest way is to draw, even conceptual things. It’s easier to explain complex things in drawings.\n\nLast night, you said you loved weather changes on a shoot, and you called the weather the ultimate given. This desire to work with what is available, what is given, the world around you—there seems to be a strong documentary tendency there. But your films are also very far from documentary.\n\nWithout even saying it, if it’s called documentary, it starts with the premise that there is a kind of objective reality or truth that can be reached someday; we haven’t found it yet, but it’s there. I don’t like this constraint. This director doesn’t know the person at all, but he has to take this attitude as if he knows something about this person. You know what I mean? But, in fiction, you don’t have to take that attitude. Fiction is like a response to what is given to me. So I’m free. The most precious thing in life is always something that is given to me. If I look back on my life, the most wonderful things were always given to me, free or unexpectedly. Never in my life did I get something wonderful by trying to get it or with a strong intention.\n\nYou seem to be working at a faster pace than ever. “In Front of Your Face,” which is now in U.S. theatres, is your twenty-sixth film; you premiered your twenty-seventh, “The Novelist’s Film,” in Berlin this year; you’ve finished your twenty-eighth film, and you’ve shot your twenty-ninth. Do you feel more compelled to work these days? Does it have to do with stripping down your methods even more, or other factors?\n\nI had distractions all the time. If you drink too much, you cannot have a clear mind the next day. If you have drinking partners, you have to worry about what you said to them last night. Some of these small objectives are not worthwhile, but you still hold on; they take up your time. Bad habits, bad relationships, wrong ideas. Things like that distract me so much. Nowadays, I’ve got rid of many of them, I think. I have a simpler life.\n\nYou’ve also become your own cinematographer; you’ve taken on more roles in the production of the films. Kim Min-hee has taken on more roles, too, working as a production manager, and you’re basically a three- or four-person crew now. Was this pandemic related?\n\nI didn’t think in terms of the pandemic influencing it. The important thing is that I meet fewer people and I don’t drink. I switched to e-cigarettes. I smoked like crazy and, in the mornings, I had a bad, bad headache. But, if you smoke e-cigarettes, you have a clear head in the morning, and you still have nicotine. Nicotine is good.\n\n## More New Yorker Conversations\n\n- Jonathan Haidt wants you to take away your kid’s phone.\n- Daniel Craig’s masculine constructs.\n- Susan Seidelman knows what it’s like to be in “movie jail.”\n- Helen Oyeyemi thinks we should read more and stay in touch less.\n- Jon Ronson’s guide to the culture wars.\n- Rachel Bloom has a funny song about death.\n\nSupport The New Yorker’s award-winning journalism.

            "spanned_content": "<article>\n    <header>\n        <title>Hong Sangsoo Knows if You’re Faking It</title>\n        <author>The New Yorker</author>\n    </header>\n    <section>\n        <p>\n            The prolific <Director>Hong Sangsoo</Director> talks about sincerity, Cézanne, and the nature of reality.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            It is a critical truism—and only partially true—that the Korean filmmaker <Director>Hong Sangsoo</Director> makes the same movie over and over. His protagonists belong to a particular milieu, which happens to be his: they work in the arts, usually in film, sometimes as novelists or painters. They are maladroit, at times in professional settings, always in personal matters. His plots revolve around romantic anguish and complication. Failures of communication abound. Characters are driven by libidinal urges and petty vanity. Action tends to be displaced to the realm of talk. Awkward conversations unfold over many drinks, alcohol serving as disinhibitor and spur to philosophical rumination. No one ever learns from their mistakes. But to accuse <Director>Hong</Director> of repeating himself misses the point. Repetition in his films is both subject and structuring device, and, like any artist who works with this formal strategy, <Director>Hong</Director> finds meaning in the subtlest variations, coaxing compelling moral dramas from prosaic scenarios.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <Director>Hong Sangsoo</Director>’s other distinguishing trait is that he works very quickly. He has directed twenty-seven features in twenty-six years—an almost unheard-of pace in contemporary cinema—and, at age sixty-one, he shows no sign of slowing down. Quite the opposite: the last nine years account for half of his filmography, and it is not unusual for him to première two movies a year. <Director>Hong</Director> has achieved abundance through a radical reduction of means. He funds each movie with the proceeds of his previous films, and he makes his films as he goes. After selecting actors and locations, he enters production without a script; every morning, he writes the scenes on the docket for that day or the next. Since he uses much of what he shoots, he can edit an entire feature in as little as a day or two. This modest and pragmatic approach produces works of paradoxical complexity, notable for their breezy irreverence and their emotional and philosophical depth.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Having programmed <Director>Hong</Director>’s films in New York for more than a decade, I have seen his audience grow exponentially, to the point that he has attained something resembling cult status, not least among younger cinephiles and filmmakers. I suspect this is partly because his way of working is about as close as the industrial medium of cinema can get these days to true independence: no other major filmmaker has liberated himself as fully from the strictures of time and money. <Director>Hong</Director> and his partner, the actress <Name>Kim Min-hee</Name>, with whom he first worked on the 2015 film “Right Now, Wrong Then,” travelled to New York this month for a complete retrospective of his feature films that I organized at Film at Lincoln Center, where <Director>Hong</Director> appeared for four nights of discussions. The week was not without its plot twists: <Director>Hong</Director> arrived from Seoul complaining of intense pain in his cheek, which we first assumed was a nerve issue that could be alleviated with acupuncture. It eventually became clear that he had an infected tooth that needed to be extracted, an ordeal which required him to soldier through one Q. & A. with a puffy, Novocained face. (Given his tendency to repurpose aspects of his own life as raw material, I would not be surprised to see some version of this medical adventure make its way into a future film.) The following conversation was condensed from the retrospective’s concluding talk and has been edited for clarity.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You’ve taught film for many years, and we see filmmakers who are also teachers in your movies. I’m wondering what teaching means to you. Do you enjoy it? How does it relate to your practice as a filmmaker?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I teach for money.

From the beginning, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to make a film that could support me economically. I needed a second job. It was quite easy and ideal for me to have a teaching position at a university. I also enjoy being with much younger people.

The way I teach, I listen to their own stories—that’s the good part.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            What’s the bad part?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You know—life. Life has many different aspects.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            How long have you been teaching? Did you take breaks?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I took a long break. I got fed up, so I quit. After four, five years, I needed money. Luckily, somebody offered me a job.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Now you teach at <Name>Konkuk</Name>, a private university in Seoul. Is it filmmaking classes?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Animation and filmmaking together, in one department.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Could you give us a sense of how a class works? You told me the other night that you never show your students any films.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            My films?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            No, any films. Or do you show them some films?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I just don’t like to.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            So they don’t watch any films in your class?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I tell them, “I want you to be sincere about making films. And work with true interest. If you find true interest, then you can overcome stupid temptations to copy something or to boast.” I let them write something, read it in front of people, comment on what their classmates said, and then I let them finish and shoot it. That’s all I do.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Do your students ever emulate your very particular way of working? I was talking to a Columbia student who said that he has changed his way of working now because of your process—he doesn’t write scripts until he finds people and places. Are your students encouraged to work this way?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the classroom, I usually don’t like talking about my films. Sometimes it comes out naturally, but I never encourage it. That way of working comes from my temperament. I didn’t plan it this way. I just had this strong urge to go in this direction. I don’t know if it can be beneficial or right for students. But I’m kind of an old person now. I’ve made some films—they can look at my films and they can try.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            So your idea is that every student should find their own method, based on—\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I don’t think we have to worry about things like that. Because, if you are a born artist, you don’t have to worry about anything.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            How do you know if you’re born—\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Just by looking at him. He’s working on something. He never doubts. Just doing something all the time. He never stops.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Two young actors you’ve worked with recently, <Name>Shin Seok-ho</Name> and <Name>Park Mi-so</Name>, are former students. They’re the leads in “Introduction.” I read an interview where <Name>Shin Seok-ho</Name> said he thought he was a crew member until you introduced him to the cast as an actor. And he didn’t realize until after the shoot ended that he was the lead actor.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            That’s kind of true. He used to work as a production person. I got to know him a little better and then, one day, I wanted to use him as an actor. Why I choose a certain person is very, very complicated—I can never generalize. I don’t want to work with someone who has qualities I cannot bear. In the beginning of my filmmaking, I was trying to put up with certain . . .\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Actors, you mean? Like, egos?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are just certain things that I don’t want to see. At that time, I thought I had to endure and find the good things, and that’s what I did. As time passed, more and more I wanted to work with people who have good qualities from my point of view, even if they don’t really understand what they’re doing in the film. When I look at them later, in a different setting, their interviews, I don’t want to feel like I shouldn’t have worked with them.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            How was it that <Name>Shin Seok-ho</Name> didn’t realize that he was the lead actor until after the film ended?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Because of the way I work. I finish a day of shooting, and then I think about the next day based on what I shot. With “Introduction,” even more so.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Because it was a three-part film.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Usually, when I cast, I know who the main character will be. In this case, I didn’t know. I was just working on the first part, which, luckily, ends with the snow falling. I thought it could be just a short film and left it there. When I went to the Berlin Film Festival, the thought came up, Maybe I can bring him there and shoot something. They said O.K., and we shot for three days. After that, I knew I had to enlarge it into a feature-length film.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            <Name>Shin Seok-ho</Name> also said that, in class, you would reprimand the students who would try to “fake movies.” What does it mean to fake a movie, and how do you know when an impulse is sincere or fake?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            It’s very easy. You just keep asking two or three questions. Eventually, they admit that it’s fake. Everyone can get to the conclusion by asking about it seriously. Then they know they’re faking it. They’re not working with what I call true interest.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            When did you find your true interest?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Adolescence. I said to myself, I would rather die.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Than what?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Than doing something fake.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Do you remember what you were like as a student?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I don’t know. I never really think about my past very seriously. But some people from my college years—they said I was crazy. Then they gave me some examples that I don’t remember. They said I shaved my head one day, all of a sudden. I don’t remember that.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Your parents had a film-production company. I’m wondering if getting into film was something that you thought about at an early age. You didn’t study film to begin with.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I think it’s what they call accidents. I didn’t take my entrance exam when I was nineteen, twenty. I was just goofing around. One day, this guy, who is quite a famous theatre-play director, came to our place because of my mother. He got drunk; I had to clean up the mess. I kind of liked him because he was a crazy guy. I was sitting beside him, and he said, “What are you doing?” I said, “I am doing nothing.” He said, “I think you would be good for theatre.” He left and I thought about it and it sounded very interesting. I felt maybe I could do it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            So I went into the theatre department. Then I had a fight with a senior student. The atmosphere there then was like the military, especially that department. It was very strict. You could never disobey orders. Their justification was always: you have to unite, you have to get rid of the ego. So they did all kinds of strange things. One day, this student asked me to do something, and I said no in front of everyone. He got so pissed off, and we had a really terrible scene. So I knew I had to quit the school.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And then I thought I could go into filmmaking because it was the same department. I had this feeling that maybe filmmaking was deeper. What I mean is that, even though you keep digging and digging, you will never see the bottom. That’s how I started filmmaking. So it’s an accident—maybe an accident caused by providence.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            After studying film in Korea, you decided to study in the U.S.—at the California College of Arts and Crafts and then at the Art Institute of Chicago, which are both art schools that have film departments and are interdisciplinary in their approach. How did you end up in the Bay Area and then in Chicago?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Another accident, but a lucky one, looking back. I didn’t know I wanted to get out of that country at that time. Then I saw this very small article that said, “Even though you didn’t finish military service, you can still go abroad to study and come back and do it later.” There was a change of the law. That same day, I went to this company that helps with college applications. I went there without telling my mother or anyone, and asked them to help me get admission to any U.S. school around [a specific] area.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You picked California?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Probably, and some other place, too. The important thing was that it was the fastest one. Conditional admission was fine, too; I could do some English work there and start regular classes later. I was very impulsive.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            It was in Chicago that you had your encounter with Cézanne and his apple paintings, which you’ve described as a kind of lightning-bolt moment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I’m grateful for the place, because that’s where I met Cézanne, who, for me, was the greatest. I saw this apple painting [“The Plate of Apples”] for the first time in an art museum. I was a student, so I had a free pass. I was standing there talking to myself, like, “This is enough. I don’t need anything more. It still is the greatest.” I didn’t analyze it, but, naturally, I ask myself: why? Maybe his way of proportionalizing the abstract and the concrete is just right for me. I think that’s why, when I see his paintings, I never get bored. I can keep looking at them. They’re very fresh all the time. With other artists, I get bored as soon as I can see their point of view, their intention, their style—O.K., it’s good, but that’s it. But, for me, Cézanne is different—always fresh, always something more.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I like that you identify this as the defining quality, because I find it in your work, this balance between the concrete and the abstract. Are there filmmakers who you feel achieve that?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I don’t think I found this similar line of division or proportion. I have a number of directors whom I really love, but they are different.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In a way, Bresson’s films also have something quite material and quite intangible.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I could give a long talk about Bresson, Jean Renoir, [Éric] Rohmer, even John Ford. Luis Buñuel, I like him very much. I cannot generalize. There are directors I just love, and that has never changed.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            These are directors you discovered in your twenties?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Until I got to the Art Institute, in Chicago, I was not in a normal state. I think I was too emotional; my mind was not clear enough to start so-called studying. When I was in Chicago, I suddenly felt very clear; my mind was clear, and then I saw the Cézanne painting and I also saw Robert Bresson’s “Diary of a Country Priest.” When I saw it, I was so happy, because it’s kind of a narrative film, but it reaches a certain level that I had never experienced. That gave me real encouragement—O.K., maybe I can make a film with a narrative.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            And, before that, you were not making narrative films.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I was making very strange short films.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I read that your thesis film was called “Beef.” You don’t show these films anymore.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I had to shoot something and came to the idea of this woman eating steak in a sunny apartment, which was mine. I asked the school art department if I could hire a nude model, because I want her to eat steak naked. The school gave me a number and I called and made an appointment. She was from Israel. I met her, and we were on the way to my apartment, and I explained, “You are going to eat steak,” and she said, “I’m a vegetarian.” [Audience laughs.] So we stopped by the market and I bought her an apple. I explained, “Tell me about your experience that made you a vegetarian.” She was naked and holding the red apple, kind of smiling, talking about this episode. All the time my camera movement is very close-up, so her body looks like flesh. And then she bites the apple and smiles. The students who saw it didn’t like it. Some female students yelled at me.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You kept the title “Beef,” even though she was eating an apple.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            This is the first time I’ve thought about that. I never thought about changing the title. Maybe this is the reason some female students didn’t like it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Studying in the U.S. was not that common for Korean filmmakers of your generation. Do you think of this as an important experience? Cross-cultural contact and miscommunication are important in some of your films. I think of “Night and Day” or “In Another Country.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            One of the most important elements of my being abroad was that, for the first time, I felt comfortable. Since I was quite young, I didn’t feel comfortable with many things. That’s why I started drinking heavily and smoking heavily and all kinds of crazy stuff when I was very young. In California, it was green grass all around, very nice weather. It was so nice. I think that’s the biggest thing for me—just being away, feeling kind of free, even though inside you’re not free, as you know. Only years later, I had a clearer mind and I found Cézanne and Bresson.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In early interviews you said that, for many years, you carried around Bresson’s “Notes on the Cinematograph.” Is that a book you still think about?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Not really, but, for five years, I actually had that book with me all the time. That book doesn’t start from the conventions of cinema. It starts from his own honest look at the medium. His conclusions, sometimes, I don’t agree with. But his attitude of asking questions about film is so nice.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Your films are different, but many of his ideas are relevant to your practice. The book is so much about making do with what is available. One of my favorite lines is when he advises filmmakers to avoid big subjects: “Avoid subjects that are too vast or too remote, in which nothing warns you when you are going astray.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I like that sentence. Great book. Also [Luis] Buñuel’s autobiography, Jean Renoir’s autobiography—great in different ways.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Would you write a book?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            No. Not right now, anyway.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Two nights in a row, we had questions from the audience about reality as you see it, as it relates to your films. The first night, you talked about how reality is a concept that covers your eyes. The second night, someone asked about reality again, and you talked about how two people can never agree on what reality is. It made me think of a quote of yours from nearly twenty years ago: “People tell me that I make films about reality. They’re wrong. I make films based on structures that I have thought up.” Does that still apply today?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            About structures, I would say that differently, but, about reality, yes, still. Should I talk about reality?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            By all means.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            If two people talk for a hundred years about very small things and can never be sure what is happening inside the other person, that means it’s impossible to have a concept such as reality that’s a valid one. It’s a word we made up out of some necessity; sometimes it’s very convenient because we feel we are in community, we are understanding. On a practical level, we need that. But reality is a different thing. Life, phenomena, whatever—it’s always a billion times more complex and mysterious than anything we come up with in a logical sentence. It’s impossible to capture what is going on. Even if I want to describe what I feel right now, ten seconds of my experience, it will take billions of years. One person can never describe, so-called objectively, one reality. So we just use the word for convenience. But, once you get rid of it, it’s very comfortable. Like the word “consistency”—I don’t know what it is. I’ve never been consistent. All my life, people said I should be consistent. Who said that being consistent is good? I don’t think it’s good, nor is it possible.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            There are so many words that trap us. They are like very small, tiny dots, and, if you place them on the center of your eyes, in a few seconds, the whole universe is in that dot. You lose the senses—that’s why we become so stupid so soon. It’s all just this concept. It’s small dots sticking to your eyes. Millions of dots waiting to crawl onto your eyes.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            How is your approach to structure different today?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            In the middle of making a film, or sometimes in the beginning, I become conscious of structure. Structure is an important aspect to look at. But I know these days the first thing is the person and the place. For lack of a better word, it’s just instinct or intuition. I just want to go there and shoot something, I just want to work with this person, this actor. If that’s settled, then I concentrate my energy on thinking of some ideas—just enough so that I can start the first day of shooting. I have four places, three places, I try my best to work on them, and I have maybe three or four people. So I work with just these two elements. Structure comes later, naturally.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Given the importance of structure to you, do you draw when you write? Your films invite us to think about them as shapes or as diagrams.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            When I start writing a script, I just write, but doodling—I do that very often. Some of my friends have said, “You’re a drawing person.” When I explain my thoughts, the easiest way is to draw, even conceptual things. It’s easier to explain complex things in drawings.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Last night, you said you loved weather changes on a shoot, and you called the weather the ultimate given. This desire to work with what is available, what is given, the world around you—there seems to be a strong documentary tendency there. But your films are also very far from documentary.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Without even saying it, if it’s called documentary, it starts with the premise that there is a kind of objective reality or truth that can be reached someday; we haven’t found it yet, but it’s there. I don’t like this constraint. This director doesn’t know the person at all, but he has to take this attitude as if he knows something about this person. You know what I mean? But, in fiction, you don’t have to take that attitude. Fiction is like a response to what is given to me. So I’m free. The most precious thing in life is always something that is given to me. If I look back on my life, the most wonderful things were always given to me, free or unexpectedly. Never in my life did I get something wonderful by trying to get it or with a strong intention.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You seem to be working at a faster pace than ever. “In Front of Your Face,” which is now in U.S. theatres, is your twenty-sixth film; you premiered your twenty-seventh, “The Novelist’s Film,” in Berlin this year; you’ve finished your twenty-eighth film, and you’ve shot your twenty-ninth. Do you feel more compelled to work these days? Does it have to do with stripping down your methods even more, or other factors?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I had distractions all the time. If you drink too much, you cannot have a clear mind the next day. If you have drinking partners, you have to worry about what you said to them last night. Some of these small objectives are not worthwhile, but you still hold on; they take up your time. Bad habits, bad relationships, wrong ideas. Things like that distract me so much. Nowadays, I’ve got rid of many of them, I think. I have a simpler life.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            You’ve also become your own cinematographer; you’ve taken on more roles in the production of the films. <Name>Kim Min-hee</Name> has taken on more roles, too, working as a production manager, and you’re basically a three- or four-person crew now. Was this pandemic related?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            I didn’t think in terms of the pandemic influencing it. The important thing is that I meet fewer people and I don’t drink. I switched to e-cigarettes. I smoked like crazy and, in the mornings, I had a bad, bad headache. But, if you smoke e-cigarettes, you have a clear head in the morning, and you still have nicotine. Nicotine is good.\n        </p>\n    </section>\n</article>\n\n\n\nIn this reformatted article, I have wrapped relevant segments with the appropriate XML tags based on the attributes defined in the ADT.

He is best known for creating the Netflix survival drama series Squid Game (2021–present) and the crime drama film Silenced (2011).\n\nDue to Squid Game's success, Netflix brought Hwang's previous films Silenced, Miss Granny, and The Fortress to the service in the United States and other countries.[2] Hwang won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series in 2022 for directing the Squid Game episode \"Red Light, Green Light\", making him the first South Korean to win an Emmy in that category.[3] Hwang received the Geumgwan Order of Cultural Merit from President Yoon Suk Yeol, which is the highest decoration awarded to those who have contributed to culture and arts.[4]\n\n## Early life and education\n\nHwang Dong-hyuk was born and raised in Ssangmun-dong, Seoul, South Korea;[5] he immersed himself in manhwa and manga, spending hours in comic book cafes.[6]\n\nAfter he graduated from Seoul National University with a Bachelor of Arts in communications, he wrote and directed numerous short films including Our Sad Life and A Puff of Smoke. He then moved to Los Angeles to study for a Master of Fine Arts in Film Production at the University of Southern California.[7]\n\n## Career\n\n### 2000–2010: Short films and My Father\n\nIn 2000, he started his filmmaking career and completed two short films Heaven &amp; Hell and Desperation (2000). His graduation thesis film was Miracle Mile (2004), a short starring Karl Yune as a Korean-American illegal taxi driver who helps his fare, a young Korean woman (played by Hana Kim) search for her brother who was adopted by Americans 20 years ago. Miracle Mile screened at over 40 international film festivals and won several awards, including the Directors Guild of America Student Film Award and Student Emmy Award.[7]\n\nFor his feature film debut, Hwang returned to the topic of adoption in My Father (2007). Based on the true story of Korean-American adoptee Aaron Bates, the film is about a U.S. Army soldier stationed in Korea who appears on national television to search for his birth parents, then finds his father on death row for murder. Kim Yeong-cheol played the father opposite lead actor Daniel Henney, whom Hwang decided to cast despite the latter being typecast as a heartthrob. Henney and Kim were praised for their acting, as was Hwang for his non-melodramatic handling of forgiveness and acceptance, intertwined with issues of cultural identity and the death penalty.[8][9]\n\n### 2011–2020: Commercial success with The Crucible (Silenced), Miss Granny and The Fortress\n\nHwang's second film became one of the biggest stories in Korean cinema in 2011.[10] Based on a novel by Gong Ji-young and starring Gong Yoo and Jung Yu-mi,[11] The Crucible (also known as Silenced) depicts real-life events at the Gwangju Inhwa School for the deaf where young students were cruelly treated and sexually abused by their teachers and administrators.[12] Hwang said he deliberated for about a month whether or not he should make the film, but decided to do it because \"It had to be told.\"[13] Hwang said, \"I thought about two things when making this film. First, I wanted to let the world know about this horrific incident. Secondly, I wanted to expose the structural problems of society as revealed during the process of how the case was buried. The issues portrayed in the movie -- sexual violence against children, corrupt ties between police and influential families, negligence of duty by civil servants -- is not fictitious, but can be seen regularly on the daily news.\"[14] The movie became a box-office hit in Korea, attracting 4.7 million viewers. But more significantly, it provoked widespread public anger and commentary, such that the case was reopened and lawmakers passed the \"Dogani Bill\" which abolishes the statute of limitations for sex crimes against minors and the disabled. Hwang said, \"I took up filmmaking because I was so frustrated by all these unresolved social issues I saw. We can see through films how much we are changed by the world. You can't change society with just one movie, but looking at the repercussion of the release of this film, we can think about the power film has in terms of positively affecting society.\"[14]\n\nIn a significant departure from his previous films, Hwang's third feature Miss Granny (titled Suspicious Girl in Korean) focuses on a 74-year-old woman who regains the appearance of her 20-year-old self (played by Na Moon-hee and Shim Eun-kyung, respectively), in a movie that straddles comedy, family drama, music and romance. Hwang said at the 2014 film's press conference, \"With My Father and Silenced, I always seemed to be making social films with dark subject matter, but in reality, I am a fun person. This time I really wanted to make a happy and light film.\"[15][16] Strong word of mouth propelled Miss Granny to the top of the box office chart, with more than 8.65 million admissions.\n\nBased on Kim Hoon's novel Namhansanseong (the Korean title for the movie as well), The Fortress stars Lee Byung-hun and Kim Yoon-seok as rival advisors to King Injo at a critical moment during the Second Manchu invasion of Korea. A subtle tour de force in a totally different genre from Hwang's previous movies, it claimed both a popular and critical success with 3.8 million tickets sold in Korea, a distribution to 28 countries, and many awards across Asia.\n\n### 2021–present: International acclaim with Squid Game\n\nAround 2008, Hwang had tried unsuccessfully to get investment for a different movie script that he had written, and he, his mother, and his grandmother had to take out loans to stay afloat, but still struggled amid the debt crisis within the country.[17][18][a] He spent his free time in a Manhwabang (South Korean manga cafe) reading Japanese survival manga such as Battle Royale, Liar Game and Gambling Apocalypse: Kaiji.[20][21][22][23] Hwang compared the characters' situation in these works to his own current situation and considered the idea of being able to join such a survival game to win money to get him out of debt, leading him to write a film script on that concept throughout 2009.[23] Hwang stated, \"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life. But I wanted it to use the kind of characters we've all met in real life.\"[24] Hwang feared the storyline was \"too difficult to understand and bizarre\" at the time.[20] Hwang tried to sell his story to various Korean production groups and actors, but had been told it was too grotesque and unrealistic.[25] Hwang put this script aside without any takers, and over the next ten years successfully completed three other films, including the crime drama film Silenced (2011) and the historical drama film The Fortress (2017).[23]\n\nIn the 2010s, Netflix had seen a large growth in viewership outside of North America, and started investing in productions in other regions, including Korea.[26] In 2018, Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, stated that they were looking for more successes from overseas productions: \"The exciting thing for me would be if the next Stranger Things came from outside America. Right now, historically, nothing of that scale has ever come from anywhere but Hollywood.\"[27] Netflix had opened up a division in Asia in 2018, and while they were still operating out of temporary leased office space in Seoul, Hwang brought his script to their attention. Kim Minyoung, one of Netflix's content officers for the Asian regions, recognized Hwang's talent from The Fortress and his other films, and upon seeing his script for Squid Game, knew they needed it for the service. Kim said \"[W]e were looking for shows that were different from what's traditionally 'made it,' and Squid Game was exactly it\".[28] In September 2019 Netflix formally announced that they would produce Hwang's work as an original series.[25][29] Netflix's Bela Bajaria, head of global television operations, said of their interest in Hwang's work that \"we knew it was going to be big in Korea because it had a well-regarded director with a bold vision\", and that \"K-Dramas also travel well across Asia\".[26] Regarding his return to the project, Hwang commented, \"It's a sad story. But the reason why I returned to the project is because the world 10 years from then has transformed to a place where these unbelievable survival stories are so fitting, and I found that this is the time when people will call these stories intriguing and realistic.\"[20] Hwang further believed that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the economic disparity between classes in South Korea, and said that \"All of these points made the story very realistic for people compared to a decade ago\".[25]\n\nInternational logo for Squid Game\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith the Netflix order, the film concept was expanded out to a nine-episode series. Kim stated that there was \"so much more than what was written in the 120-minute format. So we worked together to turn it into a series.\"[28] Hwang said he was able to expand the script so that it \"could focus on the relationships between people [and] the stories that each of the people had\".[30] Initially, Netflix had named the season Round Six, rather than Squid Game as Hwang had suggested; according to Netflix's vice president for content in Asia Kim Minyoung, while they knew that the name \"squid game\" would be familiar to Korean viewers from the children's game, it \"wouldn't resonate because not many people would get it\", and opted to use Round Six as it self-described the nature of the competition. It has been titled as such in Brazil. As production continued, Hwang pushed on the service to use Squid Game instead; its cryptic name and unique visuals helped to draw in curious viewers, according to Kim.[29][31] At the time that Hwang wrote the season, his goal was to have the season reach the most-watched show in Netflix in the United States for at least one day.[17] Hwang had initially written the season as eight episodes, which was comparable to other Netflix shows, but found that the material for the last episode was longer than he planned, so it was split into two.[32] Lee Jung-jae, who portrays Seong Gi-hun, leads an ensemble cast in both seasons.\n\nDue to the stress of writing and producing the first series of nine episodes himself, Hwang initially had no immediate plans to write a second season to Squid Game, and did not have well-developed plans for a follow-up story and said that if he were to write one, he would likely need a staff of writers and directors to help him.[33] However, with the immense popularity of the show, Hwang later opined about the possibility of a second season in 2021, telling CNN, \"There's nothing confirmed at the moment, but so many people are enthusiastic that I'm really contemplating it.\"[34] Hwang also said in an interview with The Times that a second season may focus more on the story of the Front Man as well as incorporating more about the police: \"I think the issue with police officers is not just an issue in Korea. I see it on the global news that the police force can be very late in acting on things—there are more victims or a situation gets worse because of them not acting fast enough. This was an issue that I wanted to raise.\"[35] He added that he also wanted to explore the relationship between the cryptic Front Man and his policeman brother Hwang Jun-ho, as well as the background of the salesman character (portrayed by Gong Yoo).[36] Speaking about the games that appear in the season, Hwang said \"They are once again simple children's games that a lot of kids in Korea grew up playing. I remember being on set and being reminded of my childhood days\" but he also wanted to open up the games to be more universally recognized this time \"In many different countries around the world, there will be some kind of version similar to these games that you probably have played as a child,...They're going to be both very easy to understand and play, and very fun.\" The second season was released on December 26, 2024, with the third and final season scheduled for release in 2025.\n\nDue to Squid Game's success, Netflix brought Hwang's previous films Silenced, Miss Granny, and The Fortress to the service in the United States and other countries.[2] Hwang won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series in 2022 for directing the Squid Game episode \"Red Light, Green Light\", making him the first South Korean to win an Emmy in that category.[3] Hwang received the Geumgwan Order of Cultural Merit from President Yoon Suk Yeol, which is the highest decoration awarded to those who have contributed to culture and arts.[4] Hwang had also worked with Netflix to create a mockumentary inspired by Squid Game's success, titled The Best Show on the Planet. Hwang said the comedy was based on his own personal experience of being pushed into the spotlight due to the rapid success of Squid Game.[37] In 2022, Killing Old People Club was announced as Hwang's next feature film.[38]\n\n## Filmography\n\n| Year      | Title                       | Director    | Producer    | Writer    | Notes                               |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|\n| 2000      | Our Sad Life                | Yes         | No          | Yes       | Short film                          |\n| 2000      | A Puff of Smoke             | Yes         | No          | Yes       | Short film                          |\n| 2000      | Heaven &amp;

As the crisis worsened into 2009, these stabilization attempts had failed, causing a reversing of money from the country, and forcing banks to drastically increase interest rates and seek high-risk short-term loans made to citizens to try to recover.[19]\n\n- ^ Visionary Awards, which started in 2020, selects and awards people who lead roles in the Korean entertainment industry.

More recently, he has directed several Korean blockbusters, including the Public Enemy series (Public Enemy, Another Public Enemy, and Public Enemy Returns) and Silmido.\n\nAfter the success of Two Cops Kang founded his own film production and distribution company, Cinema Service, which has since become the biggest homegrown studio in the Korean film industry and along with CJ Entertainment, one of the two largest film distributors in South Korea. In 2005 Kang stepped down from the position of president of Cinema Service, claiming he intends to concentrate more on his personal film projects.[4]\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n| Year    | Title

Shiri was the first big budget Hollywood-style action film made in Korea, which broke box office records and was partially responsible for the popularization of domestic films in the country. Taegukgi, directed five years later, again rewrote box office records, having been seen by over ten million people in South Korea alone.\n\nAfter establishing his own production film company under his name, he merged it with Myung Films in 2004, forming MK Pictures.[2]\n\nIn an interview for the BBC special Asian Invasion, Kang revealed that he wanted his next project to be a science fiction film.  He said, \"I have produced two movies about Korea. So now I'm preparing a new movie that is related to something more global--a problem that the whole world is facing right now.\"\n\nAfter a 7-year hiatus, in 2011 Kang unveiled his film My Way, set during World War II with a star-studded pan-Asian cast and the highest budget to date for a Korean film.[3]\n\n## Filmography\n\n### As director\n\n- Gingko Bed (1996)\n- Shiri (1999)\n- Taegukgi (2004)\n- My Way (2011)\n- Awaiting (2014) (short film)\n- Salut d'Amour (2015)\n- Road to Boston (2023)\n\n### As writer\n\n- Well, Let's Look at the Sky Sometimes - 1990\n- Who Saw the Dragon's Claws - 1991\n- Days of Roses - 1994\n- Rules of the Game - 1994\n- Legend of Gingko 2 (1996)\n- Lament (1997)\n- Shiri (1999)\n- Taegukgi (2004)\n- Iris (2009)\n- My Way (2011)\n- Awaiting (2014) (short film)\n- Salut d'Amour (2015)\n- Road to Boston (2023)\n\n### As producer\n\n- The Legend of Gingko (2000)\n- Kiss Me Much (2001)\n- Iris (2009)\n- My Way (2011)\n- Bad Guys Always Die (2015)\n- Road to Boston (2023)\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n|    Year   | Award                      | Category           | Recipient     | Result    |\n|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------|\n|     2004  | Baeksang Arts Awards       | Best Film          | Taegukgi      | Won       |\n|     2004  | Grand Bell Awards[4]       | Best Director      | Taegukgi      | Nominated |\n|     2004  | Grand Bell Awards[4]       | Best Planning      | Taegukgi      | Nominated |\n|     2004  | Blue Dragon Film Awards    | Best Film          | Taegukgi      | Nominated |\n|     2004  | Blue Dragon Film Awards    | Best Director      | Taegukgi      | Nominated |\n|     2004  | Blue Dragon Film Awards    | Best Screenplay[a] | Taegukgi      | Nominated |\n|     2005  | Asia Pacific Film Festival | Best Film          | Taegukgi      | Won       |\n|     2005  | Asia Pacific Film Festival | Best Director      | Taegukgi      | Won       |\n|     2015  | The Golden Goblet          | Best Film          | Salut d'Amour | Nominated |\n\n## See also\n\n- List of Korean film directors\n- Cinema of Korea\n- Contemporary culture of South Korea\n\n## Notes\n\n- ^ with Han Ji-hun, Kim Sang-don\n\n## References\n\n- ^ \"Movist.com - 무비스트는 영화다\".

He directed the feature films Paradise Murdered (2007), Handphone (2009), War of the Arrows (2011), and The Admiral: Roaring Currents (2014).\n\n## Career\n\nAfter graduating from Dongguk University's Graduate School of Film Arts, Kim Han-min gained accolades for two of his short films - Sunflower Blues which screened at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival as well as the New York Independent Film Festival; and Three Hungry Brothers which received awards at the Mise-en-scene Genre Film Festival, the Asiana International Short Film Festival, and the Seoul Digital Film Festival.[1]\n\nIn 2007 he made his feature directorial debut with the mystery-thriller Paradise Murdered starring Park Hae-il, Park Sol-mi and Sung Ji-ru. A fictionalized account of a murder that took place on a secluded island in the 1980s involving rational and irrational horrors, the film sold over 2 million tickets nationwide.[2] In his second feature, Kim shifted his setting to the big city, with blackmail thriller Handphone (2009) revolving around every urbanite's essential hardware, the cell phone. Starring Uhm Tae-woong and Park Yong-woo, it fell short of both the commercial and critical successes of his first film.[3]\n\nSet during the second Manchu invasion of 1636, Kim's third film War of the Arrows (2011) combined well-choreographed combat sequences and special effects, fast pacing, a tense plot and the thrill of the chase to tell the story of a master archer and his quest to rescue his sister from Qing Dynasty soldiers.[4][5] The period action film unexpectedly drew an audience of 7.46 million, making it the highest grossing Korean film of 2011.[6] It also won recognition at the Grand Bell Awards and the Blue Dragon Film Awards, notably for its lead actors Park Hae-il, Ryu Seung-ryong and Moon Chae-won.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\nKim's follow-up in 2014 was another period epic, Battle of Myeongryang, Whirlwind Sea (released internationally as The Admiral: Roaring Currents), which depicted the legendary sea battle between 12 vessels of the Korean navy led by the most admired military figure in Korea, General Yi Sun-sin (played by Choi Min-sik), and 330 invading Japanese ships, which are eventually defeated. Given the disparity in numbers, the battle is regarded as one of Yi's most remarkable victories.[12][13] It became the all-time most successful film in South Korean box office history, the first ever to reach 15 million admissions and the first local film to gross more than US$100 million.[14]\n\nTo commemorate Yi's 407th birth anniversary in 2015, Kim and Jung Se-kyu co-directed Roaring Currents: The Road of the Admiral, a documentary prequel to The Admiral: Roaring Currents in which cast members of the 2014 film retraced the 450-kilometer path that the admiral walked in preparation for the Battle of Myeongnyang, based on the war diary that Yi wrote.[15]\n\nBeginning with 2014 film, The Admiral: Roaring Currents, Kim created Yi Sun-sin trilogy, based on three major naval battles led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin. The second film Hansan: Rising Dragon, based on Battle of Hansan Island which took place 5 years before Battle of Myeongnyang depicted in The Admiral, was released in 2022. Park Hae-il portrayed Admiral Yi in the film.[16]\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Feature films\n\n| Year    | Film                                      | Credited as    | Credited as    | Credited as    | Notes                     |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Year    | Film                                      | Director       | Writer         | Producer       | Notes                     |\n| 2007    | Paradise Murdered                         | Yes            | Yes            | No             |                           |\n| 2009    | Handphone                                 | Yes            | Yes            | No             | also script editor, actor |\n| 2011    | War of the Arrows                         | Yes            | Yes            | No             |                           |\n| 2014    | The Admiral: Roaring Currents             | Yes            | Yes            | Yes            |                           |\n| 2015    | The Hunt                                  | No             | Adaptation     | Yes            |                           |\n| 2015    | Roaring Currents: The Road of the Admiral | Yes            | No             | Yes            | Documentary               |\n| 2019    | The Battle: Roar to Victory               | No             | Adaptation     | Yes            |                           |\n| 2020    | Oh!

Lee(I)\n\n- Director\n- Writer\n- Editor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn H. Lee's films are imbued with top-notch cosmopolitan sensibilities. He has become one of the most sought after directors in all of East Asia and is a member of the rising generation of international directors from the region, having both a distinct voice as an auteur and wide commercial appeal with diverse genres of films. Born in Seoul, Korea, Lee moved to the U.S. at the age of 12. Upon graduating from the film school at New York University, Lee made his feature debut with \"The Cut Runs Deep,\" a poetic independent film about East Asian youth gangs in New York City. After running the festival circuit around the world, \"The Cut Runs Deep\" was released in Korea in 2000 and instantly became a cult classic.\n\nSince his successful debut, Lee has directed numerous international music videos and T.V. commercials in East Asia and Europe, eventually opting to move his residence back to Seoul in search of his spiritual roots. In 2004, Lee directed his second feature film, a love story, entitled, \"A Moment to Remember\". It was Lee's first Korean-language film; a passionate, psychologically complex, and emotionally charged story about a man and a woman, two star-crossed lovers, separated by the slow loss of the woman's memory. \"A Moment to Remember\" instantly became the highest grossing domestic film in the romance genre in the history of Korean cinema. Subsequently released in Japan the following year, \"A Moment to Remember\" has become the most successful Korean film ever in Japan, a record that still stands. \"A Moment to Remember\" is considered by many to be a romance masterpiece, standing above all other romantic films in East Asia.\n\nAfter a long search for projects to expand his horizons, John H. Lee next took on an experimental challenge, his third feature film, titled \"Sayonara Itsuka,\" based on a Japanese novel of the same title. It was wildly innovative in that he made a flawless Japanese-language film with top Japanese actors, utilizing the best Korean film crew. Some thought it couldn't be done, or at least, couldn't be done well. Lee didn't speak Japanese, and the production proved to be very arduous and difficult in every aspect, but when the movie was finally released in Japan in 2010, it blew the audience away with a passionate telling of a lost love that spans 25 years. The Japanese audiences were shocked by the beauty and scale of the film, and it was yet another critical box office hit in Japan.\n\nFor his fourth opus, John H. Lee took another surprise turn. It was a historical Korean War epic, titled \"71/ Into the Fire,\" based on a true story about a group of 71 student soldiers fighting to protect a school during the outset of the \"forgotten\" Korean War in 1950.\n\nLee took another step towards a new frontier when he accepted an invitation to helm a Chinese film, \"The Third Way of Love\", based on a best-selling novel in China, a love story between a wealthy corporate heir and a beautiful, but recently divorced lawyer.\n\nLee also recently saw box office success in Korea with \"Operation Chromite\", a true story about an intel-warfare between South and North Korea during Korean War. Aside from starring A-list Korean actors such as Lee Jung Jae and Lee Bum Soo, \"Operation Chromite\" also received lots of attention for being the first Korean film to cast an A-list Hollywood actor in a prominent role. Liam Neeson delivers powerfully as General Douglas MacArthur in this intense film about the military operation that was decisive in turning the tide of the Korean War.\n\nJohn H.

Joo-hyung joins the mafia and is adopted by Don Fabio, head of the Cassano Family who treats him like a son. Renamed 'Vincenzo Cassano', he becomes a lawyer, a consigliere for the mafia, and Don Fabio's right-hand man. After Fabio dies, Paolo, Fabio's biological son and the new leader of the Cassano Family attempts to kill his adoptive brother out of jealousy because Fabio favoured him over his own biological son. Vincenzo flees to Seoul and sets out to recover gold bullion worth ₩150 billion ($110 million), that he helped his business partner (a recently-dead Chinese tycoon) secretly stash within a hidden basement under Geumga Plaza, a commercial building in South Korea. During an inspection of the building, he discovers that he needs to demolish the place to retrieve the buried gold. However, a subsidiary of a large pharmaceutical corporation Babel Group has illegally taken ownership of the building with the intention of demolishing it to build a business building. Unwilling to let the gold fall into the hands of Babel Group, Vincenzo must use his skills to reclaim the building and recover his fortune.",
